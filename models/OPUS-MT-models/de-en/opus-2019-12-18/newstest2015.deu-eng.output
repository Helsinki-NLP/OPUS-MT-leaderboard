The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first important foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic relations with the world's third largest economy.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrested 20-year-olds After Rapid Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before he went to the bushland where the officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha Police is accusing a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal and ruthless driving.
He is due to appear before the district court in Karratha on September 23rd.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was rehearsed at a hearing by the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, slept, and couldn't signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Highlands of Scotland on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reflection on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"Just as unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employee empowerment law together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-unionist forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law Act in order to create a possibility for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation, to complain to a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks the unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to unite in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Being fully aware that the workers and their unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and to raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every occupation or trade.
Agreements restricting or aiming to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at this are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and then to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - had to be protected.
After these rights were under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to revisit the American ideal, so that the working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
History remembers, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and are fulfilling the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say would have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which was introduced by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to enter into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient's right of admission at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing will be held for the judge in order to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision to take the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors could afford so much time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are escaping a devious law that wants to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state to close down, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Anti-abortionists argue that the measures are designed to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has a patient's right of proof, the Centre for Reproductive Rights informed.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argumentation against the judgment, Louisiana State representatives said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patients' access rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video homage online for her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who found ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest for older women and those whose cancer had progressed at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter distances, it proposed, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of incoming doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women more closely in their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed poor long-term survival rates in women in ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining homeowners' numbers
The decline, together with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year of garden centres when today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products" according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent by people with a home for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting front gardens for park purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion is put into sale annually.
In Greater London, where the share of homeowners fell from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for RHS said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when moving."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to increasing house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather conditions in March and April of last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now transmitting again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
Meanwhile, the country's army calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using it without violence."
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already more often shoved.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the May parliamentary election last year.
The protests escalated at the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey appoints US diplomat for espionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the country's oldest US diplomat to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the U.S. Embassy businessman and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that by the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, Turkey was a major area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major countries spied on each other.
A previous report that the most important intelligence service in Germany also targeted Ankara caused the Turkish government to react much more annoyingly.
Warning Strike: Lokführer threatens with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand announced for 18 to 21 o'clock concerns all transport companies nationwide, including the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the union Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There was no regional focus.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL had not said where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Mallorca Public Prosecutor.
The chief of Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located, following allegations of corruption.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of Mallorca's Prosecutor of Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the charges of corruption and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said that the cousins of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our livelihoods behind.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a drinking tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behavior of alcoholized holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-soaked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage together have to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is particularly popular among young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconying," in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide airport
The SPRING has brought a winter surprise to southern Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 pm another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night for Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a castle that started shortly before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go through.
Windfalls reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to go through during a second approach and finally set up at about 8.40 p.m.
The delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: Highest time to network big
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switch centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable connecting the phone to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there's a thought behind it: if the cable weren't, all the listeners would fly around in no time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, the Ekeltronic (Ekeltronic?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that today's world novelty is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And anyone who still has a tube TV in the living room, for example, is simply saying that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressing of the ifa on the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who used to master the washing machine and CD player blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with unbelievably vain expert speakers: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should you talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
In fact, for about 20 years now, it has been mainly about the fact that we are supposed to connect our house.
So that the yogurt reorders itself, so that the fire alarm on vacation in the Maldives informs us that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office on our arrival soon ...?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will come true in the near future: we lift our watch, say to her loudly "suck!" - and at home the vacuum robot departs.
Crazy.
Everything comes down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods blur," a industry expert raunts, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam cooker sends the weather report and the data glasses shows how long the pizza in the oven still takes, but that doesn't help because we are in traffic jams.
From daily practice, we also know that when a new-fashioned device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air raid shelters, while rocket and mortar fire struck their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza were closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel drawn by rocket launch holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed granite shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a local resident at Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of inhabitants of border communities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move into safer areas further away from Gaza and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily marked by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
During the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD prohibition proceedings
In view of the NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has advocated an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should come to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that rather makes me come to the conclusion that we are fighting the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had barely failed at the five-percent hurdle in the Sunday vote.
A first attempt for a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003 because the protection of the constitution had informants in the NPD top at that time.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new proposal in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
At the Neuländer Platz refugees are now accommodated in tents.
The main reception for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all seams.
Now the Interior Department has had three tents of the Red Cross set up next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to stir citizens' reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg district administration currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough space in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
Due to this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by five and six percent on average.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices only rose by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless also said that with the beginning of spring, there would be an increase in real estate for sale for the next few months, which would be subject to "a real test" on the market.
"When looking at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press he contradicts statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him to pose "like a general."
The style of the university is not this, according to the communication.
The Medau family had already been informed orally about the idea of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans did not become known until July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preconceptions or even decisions," but there are "preferences."
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle, which was necessary for the access, was also less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was and is no mention of a nine-metre-wide road.
According to the current stand, it is about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to allow.
Train parking is not at all because this can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the locals
According to the president of the university, the nursery Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and would lead the access to the parking deck along the front door, is "not to be affected."
Rather, he states that "this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the confluence to Friedrich-Strieb-Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring Realschule.
It is therefore much more important than the particular interests of Mr Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' council of the crib, with the extension of the street, a "few natural spots of Coburg are lost," is justified, "the reader can decide for himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, intends to inform the city council about the construction development of the university by 2020 "and address the importance of new development in this context."
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery last week about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access for the new parking deck should not lead over the campus and Friedrich-Strieb-Straße, but over the Medau-Berg.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be double-lane on a length of about one kilometre.
According to projections by the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day.
The city did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga player SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly cited health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured for several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He thus retires internationally with a balance sheet of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the huge rear-space player wants to go to Torejagd for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation with the Icelander, who announced his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me just as much as they will inspire my long-standing teammates and my successors.
But for my club I would also like to be available healthy in the next few years, for this long regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed man had even had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go by no body without a trace.
I have some health sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot surgery that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure properly under control.
There are also some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I control my head but cannot deceive my body," Glandorf explained in an interview to the magazine "Handball Time."
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all ropes are tearing, I am always ready to talk," explained the two-time family father to the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go a little straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Championships and the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).

German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
The Federal Statistical Office reported this and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
External trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, total GDP growth for the first half of 2013 was 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fly drivers" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were delighted by the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a little "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Further the route, which was advertised for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On distances of 95 kilometers with 1175 altitude meters, 120 kilometers with 1475 altitude meters and 145 kilometers with 1775 altitude meters, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor's representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will meet again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on 30 August or during another weekend," but the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political-safe activist, former prisoner, has put on paper in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought scraps for thought scraps, the Munich-born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: from the onanie as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also includes abstract but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom of, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how music influenced him not only (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who "is created by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving away everything unnecessary."
Between all the high-spiritual views, however, there are also short anecdotes to earth: about fights in one of GI's frequented restaurants or a crazy car ride, where he aimed at a tree on the front.
Here too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown up when I was a child - went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life, he was that serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he got a glimpse of how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep stygic labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly singing because he could wash the foundry.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without any love testimony from his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn't until my mother got sick at the end of her life that we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on TV for a fairly long time."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke story-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black," Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "for years award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984 and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought to himself: "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just gonna spend the time or step a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was predominantly a middle-class domain, whites in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry wrote 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right on.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem had been solved.
I went off stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This also came along well, so it's like a big shield of the gods saying to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a THURNING voice.
So I'm gonna stick with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts, while he imitates people time and again.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're driving it out of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I feel like doing it, but overall, I don't get as much as I used to.
I'm gonna ask him if he's ever gonna do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah."
The approach to Parliament had also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post," Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for action on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened with a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
Shia Huthis fight for more independence from Sunni ruler Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieged the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, bloody battles with the Yemeni army occur over and over again.
Kenya registers officials to contain "ghost workers"
Kenya has started registering all state officials biometrically in order to delete "spirit workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, according to a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public sector when he took office in 2013.
At an audit earlier this year, it was found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost in payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid out on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their biometric registration data are included, has been communicated in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This approach will make a significant contribution to rationalizing the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also by correcting the payroll at both levels of government - so the "ghost workers" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be discussed in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the founder of Aldi Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
That's what a court clerk said on Monday.
The application states that Achenbach has cheated on the purchase of artworks and vintage cars and that Berthold Albrecht has calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
Forty-four years he was in the school service, 23 of whom were headmasters.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershauseners and Kollbachers from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his striving to see man in the disciple.
The Snowman is the most famous mountain in the Krkonoše Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teacher profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So Richter transferred it to the Upper Franconian valley village.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to run six times a week ten kilometers to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a bedtime in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954 the second state examination after three years of teaching.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were combined in Petershausen in today's Town Hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reduction in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, so the children and their teachers were able to move into today's building from September 1982, which was extended after Richter's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workroom built at municipal cost and during the expansion of 1997 cellar rooms, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled gratefully.
During his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who replied to a report from a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know: "That doesn't always work out." Whether he means only his students or just his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves, they did not get from him a punitive work and were not thundered to detention either.
At the expense of the community, Richter had ordered two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents competed against each other, even if there was a violet.
For the sake of the school, judges as rector maintained a good relationship with the mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the non-partisan judge to be the last candidate on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, Richter was voted sixth and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of resting trips alone made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanying tour enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and Celebrating on Newly Discovered Ways between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday to witness a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who started his bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen company, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, plum, sprinkle and cheese cakes, which were wonderfully pleasing to the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake rural women," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
At the drinks stand of the gym Geiß-Nidda cold refreshments could be obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies of operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already mounted already skipped bike chains again today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking spa house by reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Head of Doctorate Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 as tour leader, could only breathe briefly, he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated, wrote Facebook entries and made reports with his employees and the police's 15-member motorcycle squadron, via three telephones and a radio, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a little on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa the cyclists had a good impression when they left after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to goodbye.
After arriving in Scots, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scots Association for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival atmosphere and of course, delicacies had been prepared, such as flaming cakes with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many farms in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporty activity on the bike, the opportunity to move under the open sky was used eagerly.
The guests were increasingly mixed up with citizens who were as fond of the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb stations - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the programme for cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local media agencies report.
The police authorities did not give any immediate comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking policemen, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal organization and tapped phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla slurry against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yazenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told journalists waiting that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not everywhere peaceful over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who visits Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be restored here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It arrives with a proud tow from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
She began her career with the global management consultancy company Bain and Co., and then moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times Board for seven years and resigned as Pearson's parent company's senior position went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation allegedly amounted to almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP, when he sought more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
As early as May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of one's own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopol, which demands a complete comprehensive reform.
But what newly arrived chairman would risk taking on everything and taking apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps taking himself out of his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that weren't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrink - power, money, and status overtaken.
As the competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of the licence fees for the BBC is associated with special risks.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent are supporting it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that reducing tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official Texas Republican Governor's account on Sunday contained a debilitating remark about the Democratic District Attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one of Perry's account that denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that wasn't authorized by me.
"I don't approve the tweet and deleted it," said the later message.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets were running out of Perry's official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the earlier tweet, an unfavorable picture of the District Attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - possibly a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of investigating the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio Special Prosecutor, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal advisers asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the charge and argued that the law against the senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the State's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County and is investigating state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After he finished fifth at the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012, Perry responded to speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market to be "normal" again
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in the southeast of England had returned to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and subject to enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013" and added that this offers a "stable trading environment."
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Cadastral Office, prices in the urban area have jumped by 18.5 percent in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling prices for Berkeley's private, inexpensive and student offerings rose by about one fifth last year and were around £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound in recent months has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "village tax" before the general elections next May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced stricter lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London in 2015 to 3 percent, based on a already weak house price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now declined by a quarter every year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for forward sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, forward sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than at the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 percent annually to £ 280 million, and sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a news release on Monday before the Company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is expected to match current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax result is £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar Award.
Nude photos of the Oscar laureate Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker of "a blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will track all those who keep posting the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on Photo Sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim vs. the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really happy with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are CLOSE, people.
Let's fight back the beginnings. *Wordspiel intended*.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman for the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J."
They fell apart, so it was best to describe it, they slowly disintegrate like a cardboard box that was left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
Scratch-brushed, he knew.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this stinginess was an affair that had just begun, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a shiveringly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt and who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradisiacal valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, there were spiders in the bathrooms, naked snails had left their marks on all the windows and believed that all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a childhood fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" at the Longlist stands for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had clung mentally into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had gladly listened to at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - simply not played.
It has been successfully obsolated, just as the word obsolates.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have achieved, and how people choose the vom-tellerwasher-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels in books, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing Ailinn's big feet in a rough-comic serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny now either.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure where it would end at the beginning of a melody.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about Jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again applied, no laws or constraints.
A conformed society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group gift - grateful as those spared from fate.
People of African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, as by nature, and were given the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT WAS HAPPENED WHEN IT WAS HAPPENED - for fear of being accused of firing, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened up Labneh and Shisha pipe restaurants, kept in mind and became depressed with the inaction.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in their presence.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's vision.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your big ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the comforting charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe that's what he wanted, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from her deck chair, knocked over the console and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I'm attracted to you perversely," she said...
Except I'm not.
He felt sorry for her, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear she felt when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more distracting to WHAT WHEN their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always willing to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Thickhead?
They would have shown her a big fist if she didn't pay attention!
They first snuggle - snuggling was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - they first snuggle and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the making itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose out of the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt leaded, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him move away from a room on the upper floor, as her companion watched him do - a man complaining of something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain to him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, shamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she couldn't remember a single time that she had seen before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just reported, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, was working on a short talk on the continued low and medium level violence in precisely the areas where their reduction, if not abolishment, would most likely have been expected, given the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggression of a people who have waged and won a thousand wars and most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was rarely experienced historically despite the highly inquiring church towers between the hedges.
But some qualities turn out to be inextinguishable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to awaken.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the former rudeness holds the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and devious quarrel at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme walnut lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and refusal to testify.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-prejudice job.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, may occasionally distort results, as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "background" and "raw," could just as well be interpreted by others as expressions of natural strength and vitality.
If you keep riding around on what has happened, WHEN it has happened, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the country's vital life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at their neighbors, cherish their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you're trying to do," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing else but that we are not yet healed as effectively as we pretend to ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that have been made in the first place to WHAT WHEN IT WAS SHOWN.
But this time it's not the others we're gonna miss out on our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest an angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions "errors" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you talk about the fact that they have left out their "rage" and their "mistrust" on "others."
It shouldn't be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we're not talking about "us" and "others."
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of whom, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I don't charge anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
Nothing needs to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, so no debt has to be redeemed if such repayment would be appropriate and if there was a way to wipe it out.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I may say anything about that -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider their report," he said, releasing them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had drove on the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said that they were acting against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said that the army of the country had surrounded his residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting on threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup, but that the military responded to the threat of "political fanatics," whose armament was imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements were acting within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
On Sunday, speakers of the Lesotho military announced that the soldiers were retreating into their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, vice-premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said that he believed he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the clashes in his unity government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, despite other charges.
Production in the eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of Manufacturing (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced collapses in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and for threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that this week the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information on whether he is considering a quantitative facilitation for the eurozone, in line with those undertaken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
It is also not reassuring to note that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism are no longer effective in Germany, as in Spain and the Netherlands," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3 and the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the August Eurozone purchasing manager index of manufacturing is that the sector will continue to grow afterwards."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone seem to find life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that it would be "always more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate a type of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children still suffer in it today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan, where 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the shattered school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the shattered school sports hall in her underwear after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need another surgery.
Some grenade shrapnels are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'm thinking about a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me climbing back to school online, I think that for the first time many people see it, understand our disaster and help that it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said: "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand. "
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed her hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, "Damish told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara had stumbled outside with leg injuries in the hospital, believing that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said: "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded News of the World newspaper) to obtain the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it out there.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember Damir wanting to eat Borshch and they called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like ours.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not seeking revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the sofa, turned his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with parts of the body lying all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damish, run, run away," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image after the siege became a symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, right a picture of Georgy today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His painting was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she hurried to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was an entire family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer this date draws, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There's not a single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days haunt me all the time.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that day when Georgy wanted to go to school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgy in San Marino.
Georgy doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden in our bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgy says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People examine such tragedies over and over again and never experience the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget about it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1 is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical school in Wladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniev was captured during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to go to the FSB as a intelligence officer, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's intelligence academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, also the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been over there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this, and of course they should not suffer it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I'll go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgy won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It remains within us.
Georgy is an adult now, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated on several times, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I would say that he has overcome 50% of the horror, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only increases my pain.
I have lost many people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby so moved by a Special Operations Command to safety
Saved: Aljona Tskayeva is taken to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in her cruelty, her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Machar held her back in the school sports hall.
Machar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, who he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Machar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of having run over girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl at the crossing in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The prosecution claims that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and violated the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes to optimize exposure time for the insulation underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.

Make multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to view it under water, and the correct image setting is a lucky thing.
So make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode to make a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you make shots in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is especially important when working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you have to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthetic consultant, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the torment of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about diagnoses and illnesses, while people are mostly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel like it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking myself up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently blamed his wife Juliet.
"I want everything more immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and uncomfortable.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, that is, the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fibre construction material, which was once considered a "miracle substance," but has now been identified as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily undertook not to use it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the climax of a mesothelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
The parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, we have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been ill with mesothelioma for the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are gonna get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomers die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still going to get sick?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to come to an end in the UK, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn because of claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to one substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform," a description of the fibre structure, which makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, but it is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "high health risk" with possible death consequences.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it gives clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."

Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure by work or in the home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
According to him, most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unwittingly exposed to the material in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work has to be spent over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who has never been able to determine exactly the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've been working on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was doing surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was caused by the chest fur, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Wonderful doctors took X-rays of his chest and put on pleuracathethers to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained without diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and violent breathing.
In 2011, a patient of Abbott with similar symptoms came in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and chest fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I wasn't so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now get sick.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground cafeterias (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it doesn't just concern hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people seem to have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
Meanwhile, such innocent objects in our homes as floor tiles or pad roofs have standard asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna have another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he needed to cope with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much longer do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is whirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the breast fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast fur and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital Andrew Lawson suspects he was exposed to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is naturally invasive from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some think it's worth a shot.
Treasure says no.
"You can't cut out the chest fur," he says.
They can't get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advisory office for those affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he introduced himself cheerfully on calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which lasted four months and would probably prolong his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a somewhat more positive light. "
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be remitted, I just called and got an appointment," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail inevitably, many sufferers face a different financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally closed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full compensation," because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation of his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers who seek compensation, it is an enormous problem to associate the fatal asbestos contact with a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance records can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a fund of £350 million funded by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have agreed to in a normal damages case - about £120,000.
Around 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths, rapid action was necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Law in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expects to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"Of course, that's the most important thing," says Abbott.
You can always see that in patients.
There's something that makes you go on.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.

At the end of August, he had completed the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
This is not life-threatening.
It's life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is very physically and mentally exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or about my wife showing how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomers, such conversations have not gone through with hope, not with a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as well as Stephen Jay Gould at last) brings a grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-proclaimed protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress in principle allows the communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"It's not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said right-wing expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have its residents elected the presidency of the government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong's citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process of a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" should be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to close down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's government headquarters within a few hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisers informed that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action to take place only if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and intensified security measures, including police forces and barricades, were in place on Sunday outside the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The arrival of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, there is growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, as they put Hong Kong's lifeline at risk.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved in it and how long it lasts," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to create fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, involving 780,000 people - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of graduation balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities, where freshmen performances by private aircraft are offered.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the first luxurious UK travel service for today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to move their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company spokesman said that there were no new bookings as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NIS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of most students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a crisis in the cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student dormitory.
Feminists criticize racial and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, while the tensions in the Midwest increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles like "Thinks of Ferguson by a White Woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism there are many people who talk about whiteness and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but are not considered as "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating themes cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white women's fighters for women's suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to defend the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you realize with power why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize themselves against Lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to conception control?" Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to preventive means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race, which are clearly different in public polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism that addresses both racial and gender issues, some of her comments on the racial theme in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform also hits the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-consideration of the subject as an essential subject for women, she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of the work visas go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in women's organizations," she said.
"Swine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig who had bedded his head to a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly published and has now been removed," said one of the company's spokespersons.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale caused interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW-city Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said that the profit is the source of conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city doesn't talk about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a worthy conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega win of $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The victorious couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked to join the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators stood in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and let themselves be completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful performance of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis," which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena, which was groomed with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for heroic duel in various types of gladiator.
First, the "provocators" were in turn with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and wormplant as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius," who with throwing net, dreizack and dagger against the "Secutor" and after a short fight pushed the guy to the ground.
There the swords collided metallicly, the shields shattered and the wormplants flew surging through the arena that could become fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing Summa Rudis, the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive everyday Roman life and make the culture of the Roman era tangible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for one day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired at Roman Day, for example "Aqueduct Marmor" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft once confronted the water and energy supply and now, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "Today we still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocrust, the warm air heating that once warmed up the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Land Monuments at the Landesverband Rheinland dug up the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
It was found that the walls of an economic building were covered with a dart for drying grain and malting.
The building was probably part of a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
She presented a series of finds from these excavations in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or, like the Roman students, wrote their names with metal handles on wax tablets.
At the stand of the Roman thermal baths Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, to make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and to use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flour for a flat bread or a muesli.
With the original Roman tour car drawn by two cold blossoms, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the community of Wachtberg will also contribute to the 2014 Roman Year proclaimed in the Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtsvereinen as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnershipsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and commemorate the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the trainy Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from Roman times and offer a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorf Elementary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often not visible at first glance, are to be made tangible again.
In the town hall of Wachtberg, a small presentation will recall the discovery of the Berkum Matron Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Burdens West Africa's Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to West Africa's economy.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has heavily added to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, in the second largest market.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola are on the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
A total of more than 1,500 people died, and thousands more were infected.
Foreign companies pull out employees
Companies are operating all over the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are pulling off their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: Only a few merchants leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot in the fields.
The farmers dare not leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the West African economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
The decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors could feel "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also weighs heavily on the state budgets
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The credit rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high spending on the healthcare system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels also fall significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald the preparations for the 50-year founding festival from 12th to 14th September are running at full speed.
A big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned on Friday, September 12.
On Saturday is at 6 o'clock the big gun shooting.
Afterwards, the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" is in the big festival tent.
Blaskapelle provides for the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big parade at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of federal and Gaushooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have taken over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association for social entertainment was founded on 21 March by means of practice in small and small caliber shooting.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the club in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men found themselves, who took the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau out of the baptism on 30 April at the inn Lukas.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as shooting champions through a difficult initial period, in which it was primarily about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who had meanwhile been organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club's record came every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the efficiency of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club's "Leininger" has no longer satisfied the demands of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis."
After a work of 2700 hours on May 8, 1988, Reverend Strasser gave the ecclesiastical blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the big highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th Gaushooting, combined with the festive consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a group of firemen was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became a Boller Officer.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Boller Meeting 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work last year, the members of the association modernised the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof and thus brought it to the latest state-of-the-art technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Schützenverein.
A total of eleven teams currently participate in the round competitions: six air gun teams, an air gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went up in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has ascended from the Gauliga Nord into the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as bangs, carnival and king's ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The archers are also present at the festivals in parish and parish.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-strong team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart used to drive into a wall at the Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have his car repaired on the right side.
"I entered today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart should expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already entered the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a reboot in round 122, Buschs got
Car with the number 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued driving, but fell back to number 21.
Finding young dancers
Simply try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from the left) look forward to joining forces.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in the TV Jahn also create full-day lessons at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now young people are increasingly being sought for a sport that is healthy and is great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of the eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of the twelve- to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old tells.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can taste the training session on Thursdays between 17 and 18 o'clock or on Fridays between 17 and 18.30 o'clock in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," the trainer explains.
Afterwards, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore through classical music to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies and we have also stayed in the dance room once," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dance, you can also taste it in one of the other TV Jahn offers.
Children and teenagers can always taste the lessons on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you're looking for Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a debt list, which is to be discussed with the interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR).
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director General for the implementation of penal measures, said Rosen Zhelyazkov to the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of Interior Ministry Employees.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy battles, in which Russian tank battalions were allegedly also involved, the Ukrainian army abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk today, Monday.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn human consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists fired aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have once again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, according to Russian agencies, the insurgents reported on Monday.
Coast Guard vessels sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian Coast Guard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been fired on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, said one spokesman in Kiev to transmit 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicise their demands.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a gross breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, "they regard us as an opponent."
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A Readiness Action Plan to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new talks
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A European Union decision to send a representative to the talks was still awaited.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe draws about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks the word of power: toll will be "clearly clear"
Now the chancellor is firmly committed to this.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU has been increasingly excited by persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To put it quite clearly: she is in the coalition agreement and she will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin.
But Merkel did not lay down a detailed model for the time being.
In the black and red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Bundesverkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) had "made a proposal and we are now working on it."
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also involved in constructive discussions on a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he had also talked with Dobrindt about further ways of activating more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about that." Schäuble had left an uncommented "Spiegel" report on Sunday, his house was testing its own concept to compensate motorway investors with toll revenues - after the election in 2017.
CSU CEO Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the Cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that it would marry all the county and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU president.
In this respect, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced to talk again about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background are concerns that tolls affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded loyalty to the CDU coalition because of the toll criticism.
The Left considers the plans to have failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said Party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is scheduled to start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners must not be burdened additionally.
They should therefore receive full compensation for the tolls via the vehicle tax.
However, according to EU law, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought that she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosing is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe gait and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was gonna sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted longer.
I could never ride roller skating or skateboard with the other children and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretching her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair when I was 18 and die at 25, and in between, I'd slowly lose all my skills.
I did all this alone with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she became 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former troop training ground
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has not been fired.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up locally.
A deafening bang echoes at the blasts over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on Washington businessmen increases with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the Washington area companies were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the 2013 financial year, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $ 671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining communications in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more strongly than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
At 28 percent, Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the company's real estate values, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes of 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these gains came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be the same for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to just over one fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"The following is happening in Maryland: a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery in the real estate market
Business revenue also appears to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent in line with the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
At 6 percent, Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three departments (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia requires lower government and local corporate taxes and that overall there is a better tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are paying more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure that most small businesses are organised according to - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general multi-weapon tax revenues for the state and local governments of 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's cut in spending has an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes for a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Li Yiwei, Vice-Party Secretary of the South China metropolis, during this week's visit to an SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this concern of the twelve million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known in Germany as the Canton, is one of the richest cities in China, advertised Li.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German delegation of politicians, told the host that he would consult Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the Party Superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou started with shepherd-gumbles - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said vice-party leader Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Commerce between our two cities is growing."
Currently, travelers would have to detour over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou City, is also hoping for flight connections.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, placed this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - the Chinese vice minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded approvingly.
Well-kept partnership
Guangzhou's illustrious vice-president hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted out of office for allegations of corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is enforced with harshness by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese Association was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the pearl river is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, Li reported that she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros.
Family of Joan Rivers "pushs the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a message.
We all keep our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a hospital on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "seriously."
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that will enter the market from today on.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer will be able to identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars in the pollutant class "Euro 6" sharper nitrogen oxide values apply.
There is also more money for scaffolders: they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like selling Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion-dollar deal, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their flying pieces in games, an "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which better-knowers give the (mostly older) games a painting of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that bought a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't come about because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon did.
All we know about this right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to exercise rather than watch, it's hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others play instead of taking control console into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. while sneaking through Resident Evil, and something completely different, watching a weirdo get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the viewing perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-paced runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there isn't a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as spectator sport.
At the bouncy castle at the Burggarten Festival on Saturday there was a lot going on.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in Burggarten.
At times the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was already evident on early Saturday, when the first visitors joined the Open Air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings, had made themselves comfortable around the utility stands on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, swiped with their feet in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And through the generations.
While some were lurking on ceilings on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others were lazing at a quarter of wine in the vinotheque, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of children's make-up, the volunteers had to do their hands full in the truest sense of the word in order to become master of the crowd and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel hosted.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he bragged down on the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not diminish this.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all over the line."
Therefore, there is nothing to prevent a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made clear to the people's voice in a first balance sheet on Sunday.
He said that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company had been booked with too little strength.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the premises.
The response was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors, who flocked to the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel Hip-Hop band Blocks'n'Rox broke off their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tyre breakdown.
"They'll be there next year," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the visitor numbers.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but have to be eliminated in the second edition.
Organizers must also be critical of Facebook's social network.
"Sorry, but you just expected more for twelve euros," Melanie Meier comments on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don't see the initial problems so narrowly.
I think it's very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hut off," Stephanie Jenss writes to Amula.
Now the organizers have one year to cancel these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-use component is waiting to be used in the striking building.
The action is in the context of a larger action: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar TIRA, the hull, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom with a diameter of 47.5 meters will be slightly smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
Afterwards, the last quarter of the new shell is placed.
If the weather plays along, the action is supposed to be over the stage at the beginning of this week.
A participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge disintegrates the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge was painfully missed.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she shouted so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing the deed, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw it, too, and laughed at each other almost in their pants, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to re-enter the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle associations soon be pulling together again?
Finally, there was always a conflict between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the board members are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser castle friends, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
The points of view on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction seem to be very different so far.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: discussions about a common approach will soon be held.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on demand from our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could get together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could once again pull together in the future.
He said that there were more visible successes.
While the castle friends around Richard Dimbath, who died suddenly, had until the very last sight of a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in mind, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "discovery and experience" of the area stands in the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the castle friends, was very happy about the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has presided over the castle's friends.
A new chairman will be found in mid-September at a general meeting.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends could also make themselves a current mood image within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find themselves." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to continue working on the project "but very much."
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He praised Dimbath as a "missionary," who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, well-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
They are a tourist magnet through the high participation of the population and voluntary helpers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to drive the project forward." It could be created a "all-encompassing feature" for the rafting city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving on this point.
Their goal to document history at first is "important and good."
That's what you could see.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever idea.
He invented a loan system for books by higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there were different cost reduction options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for one semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college bookshops last spring semester, said Neebo's vice president Tevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookshops.
Here's the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one third of the price online, for which they are available at the campus bookshop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $ 239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous issues were admissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books after finishing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for a semester of about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may arise for writing notes, underscores or traces of usage.
Tenants Pay Attention: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best offers in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Take a look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination of books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price at the college bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone recorded less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape," tailored to Cameron Diaz, recorded only $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's movies such as "Dragon Tames Made Easy 2" also disappoint revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves might be the reason for children's films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's movies and described "dragon sutures made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, in the case of films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and on at least 2000 screens in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema viewers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon to appear jungle book film, told Hollywood reporters: "I think the times are changing."
We have to accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated sales of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, when sales were $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics and prophesied a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, other film industry representatives are more optimistic due to the potential cash hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood reporters: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted to streamline the league classification, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided relegation, but in the coming season only plays fifth-class.
Torpedo's ladies remain fourth-class despite their grandiose march into the Regionalliga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserve compete in the new league, in the Landesliga Göttingen clubs are no longer represented.
==References====External links==*Official website*Official website
What looks like a better district class is now the new district league South.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC compete.
Dransfeld and SC Weende play in the district league, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district upper league of the ladies starts at least in nominal strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with us.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen compete in the Bezirksliga.
With nine teams each
SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league squadron of the SCW-boys - there starts still torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
The West squadron includes Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the Eastern squadron.
The women's league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no women's teams on a circle level anymore.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves target strength, here the innovative and busy circuit board will have to think about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
For us, Stephen Fairclough followed the developments this weekend and talked to demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO youthful bush walkers were brought to safety with the winch after they were caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW the night.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man left for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Gomet's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8:00 p.m. when they had not returned home.
A search party from local police and emergency services left and the couple were found at about 11 pm near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital with an ambulance in stable condition.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter re-recorded the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the head of government, to whom they accuse electoral fraud.
The police reported that about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were clashes again on Monday between some 3,000 demonstrators and security forces.
According to the hospital, a policeman was injured.
During the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 had been injured when demonstrators tried to get to Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using it without violence."
The communication also stated: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state. "
The escalating violence has fueled concern about military intervention, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on August 14th.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially waited peacefully in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to enter Sharif's residence on the weekend.

With the 2:0 over Grödig a bitter week on Sunday has taken a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the exit in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and goaltender Steffen Hofmann, who finished third with Green-White.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second victory of the season and goes into the international game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defenseman Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd cut all the frustration from Thursday and sneak it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the rapid dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I am from the Rapid offspring," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvic blessing of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror.
He earned the goal, he already made some assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," Schrammel noted, who alluded to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results didn't vote, but the gaming was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games before it was better than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season."
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
No less pleasing to him: "That we finally played zero again."
A lot of work during the international season The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger had several failures to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget this," Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, warned, "who have been very stable lately."
The international play break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and increase a bit in the physical field," Barisic explained, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One person who may be particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself apart for the team, passing through pain.
Especially in this difficult phase he showed that he is a very important player for us," Barisic stated.
Hofmann not only gave Rapids the structure to the game before his change in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point the luck has to come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
Of course, he cautioned for concentrated further work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
We must not, however, believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can really help at the moment.
They stop at me in certain phases," Hofmann said.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to accuse himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter hit "from the category Magic Gate," as well as the regular goal of use in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly denied by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren't concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We didn't have enough qualifications.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner looked similar: "It started badly, but then we found it pure and even made a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
There's peace underneath this top
We showed a powerful tribe during our rafting of the summer series "My Piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It goes past domes, basalt heaps and basalt stone seas.
A little bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it towers beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds with a circumference of over eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider specifically consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what it has to do with the piggy pond.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
So until about 80 years ago the shepherds of the goats were supposed to have driven their animals from under-white fountains to the hard-bodied and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree are said to have rested the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, for goats are in fact grazing on the meadows again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for crucifixes.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is a bit hidden.
Further trails are signposted, climbing up towards Hochhöhen and inviting you to an extended hike.
Where's the water castle?
However, a water castle that is searched for in our next task is rarely to be found at the altitude.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have in the district some historical buildings to which the building counterfei could fit.

After weeks of tutoring, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the EU, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Foreign Minister, Federica Mogherini, as head of EU foreign policy, against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week, she will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica recounts, the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that the left party base, which is constantly rising against him, will be put to rest, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a moderate way.
Conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish candidate Donald Tusk as President-in-Office of the Council, said the prevailing opinion in Rome, was to achieve a political balance.
At the same time, the EU's chief diplomat will be deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the EU Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for her ambition, will be able to cope with the "enormous challenges."
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined forces with the Catholic centre party Margherita in 2008 to form today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she joined the high party politics, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as is noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
In Brussels, the new EU High Representative has too little diplomatic experience, so lack of substance, is countered by the PD.
In Brussels, Mogherini's suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, and are being defamed as a "Russian-friendly course."
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy's energy supply.
After Renzi began his term as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the Shake-hands were taken with indignation in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin boss to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed a different training in the company.
In four training occupations, the new employees will be active in the future: electronics technician (three trainees), mechatronic technician (two), tool mechanic (two) and process mechanic (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg in front of the forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all classes as well as the trainers will go to a team-building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the agenda.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all classes is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet remodelling has found disapproval with the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite fierce demands for a relaxation of Emmanuel Macron's new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his fellow Socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, spread sand in the drive in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists' constant trench struggles and said that she could not imagine that the new Vall's government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls doesn't have any, they are forced to form a new government if the old one hasn't even survived a summer.
"And the new one won't survive the fall or winter either," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call for Parliament to be dissolved and said that she was confident that she would be the winner in early elections and that she was ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruiser supplier, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a share of 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused a comment.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion, and in the next few years it is expected for it due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice with the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulators for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
According to regulatory authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise share 82 percent of passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking-faithful group swung the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law that only allows two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with Peking loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to fulfill their threat and to paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper setting out China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Mr Zhang Rongshun, and Mr Feng Wei, Vice-Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Offices of the State Council, should be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in the afternoon in front of the leadership's office in Hong Kong.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not foresee any democratic elements.
Putin asks Kiev to start "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian media reports on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status vis-à-vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: helping separatists to take over territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorosiya region to achieve de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel Kanal One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the separatist areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossija" or "Neurussia," a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary splendour of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on October 26 and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist areas, hope for early peace talks "in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We must immediately engage in extensive discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification of the correction of Putin's "false interpretation" underlined Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period showed a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area connecting Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
During his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, giving the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last request to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed after a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of Novoasovsk by hand, which, according to Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels, asking for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to a point where there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an unspecific escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports in Kiev on Saturday.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which were included by the Russian invasion in Ilovaysk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, told Lysenko on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his trouble with hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a who's who of the A celebrities from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the tributes of Panem" and superstars, among them the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly released private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who had been engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York City, reportedly said on a news site that the hack was "dirty" and that those affected felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies upstairs without in a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence' told TMZ: "It is an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: " Posting hacked pictures from a cell phone is nothing other than selling hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers took part in the 8th cycling tour of the Große Feldberg yesterday and supported the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Help for children with cancer).
The tour, which was a torture for some, was an easy training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
Because for the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery drove yesterday to the Feldberg by bike.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the small muscle ache, especially since the participation on the 8th bike on the Große Feldberg in favor of the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) had also personally brought him a valuable insight.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - great!"
A little puffing on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants were tormented yesterday in early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11-kilometer-long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Diessner, for example.
At the start, the green politician from the district day - red dress, red bike - did something about understatement ("Every lot of professionals, there's the goal!") but then turned out to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without need of breath.
He also crossed the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, Press Spokesperson of the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "Here it is about Charity, we would like to be there - we would have made an exit anyway today," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning, and immediately after that he had to pedal back to the heights.
The Frankfurt-based Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
Fun also had "Fritten-Toni."
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, bike tours over the Feldberg are simply included.
He had planned for 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo racing bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist."
He must be, too, because he was on the road with the "fixie bike," they are also racing bikes, but without a circuit...
Not only the 20 hikers, who climbed over the White Wall and the Fox Dance to the summit, proved that it was easy to go up without a bike, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht physician Professor Volker Lischke, who provided security with his team equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself." So the man is his own sled dog in a way.
The 718 participants - and thus more than never before - had been sent on the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg," gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
