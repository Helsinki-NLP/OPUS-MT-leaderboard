The Prague Stock Exchange is sinking against closing.
After the steep drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions in ČEZ's shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Stock Exchange continued its collapse from Monday when it fell by a further six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote by the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, stocks on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic case, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to make up for some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then decreased the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange declined by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong currency agency.
Although it belongs to China, Hong Kong determines its monetary policy itself, independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, it threatened that other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A Blutbad of American Shares
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would regulate the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
America's shares suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, with a similar break-in last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: US government is allowed to pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The senior representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators made a breakthrough in talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system to the tune of $700 billion (about $12 trillion).
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, said this to the agency Reuters.
According to various sources, the Senate could probably vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the revival of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there was a "disenchantment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilise the market should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the agency Bloomberg.
According to her, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies that plunge financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The health plan must be continued even further, but I think we are at our goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
The aim is to reassure investors of business in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congress decision could influence business on Monday.
To date, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations at the last minute could still fail on a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress, however, can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another $100 billion and later with the final $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
The President has a right of veto in this decision, but Congress can override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," according to Republican senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "estimates the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the completion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to oversee the fund.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for this.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly cost of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"That is because one does not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government split the losses among themselves," said Marek to the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is to be adopted now or early next week is not the decisive factor, Marek believes.
"It is much more important for Congressmen to agree to support the plan and to say goodbye as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the adoption is the most important at this moment," emphasized Marek.
Duel on knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
Despite all this, there are plenty of reasons why you should get a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of future owners.
I'm sure it's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also the case with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music, in a simplified way - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a pink-floyd fan will hardly handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The selection is broad.
The lifespan of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do is not even meaningful.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
Besides the primary functions, the phone and the simmer, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and can maybe also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can barbecue and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones to be able to play music for no more than a few hours.
If you make a phone call from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you won't have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is if you want to transfer the music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, besides, not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, the music can be transferred directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can be done with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without any reduction.
Players do not require any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, arranged according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the lifespan of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, also the ease of use.
Is music for you above all the backdrop and listen to it every day only briefly for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which almost every cell phone can really do.
You also don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can in itself be a striking argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab your phone in your jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can rely on the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a few MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll get a very decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically most sophisticated telephones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players lies in the ease of use.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest - players can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no danger of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous bill for data transfers.
Which device should you grab now?
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
Attention, though.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, prefer specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use is that of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually, is the furthest.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you MP3 players of the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider comes to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting much longer.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe at all.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the recent steps taken by the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, since in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain about the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), has often agreed that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has very many opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find any frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market resulted in a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile operators had to react to.
Even before such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, it doesn't take long to look for examples.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in attracting more than 100 thousand customers and thus becoming the country's five largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon among others in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that they can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, virtual providers need a lot less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually turn out to be low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
In the UK, for example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobileking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move to rely on a non-clichéd target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could take root in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone's spokesperson Miroslav Čepický also doubted this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of service provision."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile operators mean no chance
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," says Jana Studničková, Press Spokesperson of the Penta Finance Group in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, the GTS Novera group has been showing interest in launching a virtual mobile network provider, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network services, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we were already able to achieve progress in the negotiations," said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and reputable project in this area," says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefónica O2 press department.
Other suppliers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Press Spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on."
And she adds: "In the T-Mobile network, hardly any virtual provider will show up by the end of the year.
At this moment, we should already have a concrete offer to be able to think so in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure sharing.
This is precisely what we consider the best from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers in hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be more competitive, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came from T-Mobile when U:fon came on the market.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is just an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
Given this approach, however, the absolute disinterest of Czech regulators is surprising.
This is not just ČTÚ's attitude, which unfortunately - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS) is the exclusive holder of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, took its very typical attitude to this whole problem.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," says Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in his answer to our question.
Such a formulation would not surprise representatives of suppliers.
This is more than questionable by an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, seeks to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not one of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same price of petrol at the petrol stations is certainly only chance and the result of a fierce competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence in this case suggesting anti-competitive action, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so it does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also missing from the telecoms regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile operator - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if one does not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
In this context, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a quite common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act has failed to enforce the extension of ČTÚ's competence to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know only too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one's looking
For the time being, the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
They are usually companies operating in the field of multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar kind of resale.
"If there are cases that describe you, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be talked about by those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, the activity of these companies does not result in negligible profits, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full value over it like the normal customers of the mobile phone providers."
But this alone should at least seem strange to ČTÚ.
Another question for the ÚOHS also opens up.
If mobile providers close their eyes to such an approach, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the supplier's statement that they do not know about them and that their terms and conditions would prohibit them.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasised several times in the text, the market entry of virtual suppliers resulted in a significant fall in the price of the various services.
In virtually all countries, where virtual providers were created, traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, which by no means sought to safeguard the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was born, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves into the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that lack of clarity in competences is more than beneficial in these cases.
But let's not throw the shotgun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile phone market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will at last make no more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the day of Czech statehood.
The anthem was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken over by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variations, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried both and then with the choir to stick to a clear diction so that one can understand the text well so that a harmony can be created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed on stage in 1834 in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people accepted it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song then became an organic component of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague transport companies transport for the first time on Wednesday also on a chip
Wednesday, October 1st, 2008 will be a date in the history of Prague's transport operations, when the first passengers will enter a metro, tram or bus that will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) at the same time on their chip card, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
Since yesterday the coupons are also available via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points there is also a desk with trained staff at the disposal of travellers, which advises those interested in the Internet purchase and also puts the coupon on the map," says Martin Opatrný, spokesperson for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the Opencard at self-service machines, which are installed in some subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket removers, the passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"At the moment there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it is said to be eighty," Opatrný adds.
The Coupon is controlled by an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
All you have to do is introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region Mittelböhmen arrive in the capital.
"On trains belonging to Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading equipment with which they can check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid the ticket control. This organisation compiles the timetables for Prague's transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the ticket office at the driver's office.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the Opencard must be placed in a marked position on the side of the checkout.
The driver thus checks the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive by suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the USA
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This can be seen from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live under the auspices of the United States of America at least.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have turned to the US President in 1945.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudeten lies at heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We can't believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are speaking to a foreign state that has oppressed and eliminated minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," is the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of vengeance of the "Czech oppressors."
If the US President had doubts about the attitude of the Böhmerwald Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, some contemporary witnesses consider it to be a good picture of the Sudeten Germans' expectations at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had such an opportunity at all.
Some waited for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was a Budweiser German in the Baltic Sea Navy during the war.
When he was in British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," says Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that they would expel him from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
Expensive action for safety on the streets in Czech history.
This could also characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office promises to stop drivers from being dangerous behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on the radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to displace drivers from too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And remind them to strap on before you start.
The campaign aims above all to raise awareness among young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also demonstrated by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't you think - pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And then the word "pay" is written in a blood laughter.
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see pictures with drastic photos of victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads will decrease.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for motorists
"For the drivers the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when they drive in red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
In his opinion, boards that alert drivers to a danger are even less effective.
"If you put on a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow into the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke out in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace could be made with Palestine and Syria in exchange for this.
He emphasized this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to assign a similar percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templebers and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This is not going to work," he continued.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the side of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do without to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister specified.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance coach it is not permitted to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus from the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the way to the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, to all the misfortunes, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment when the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places; as confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this was initially not agreed with the movement of travellers.
Later this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travelers are allowed to go to the toilet when they have their seats," he said.
The law doesn't know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term "vehicle companion', but it does not define its rights and obligations," adds the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka.
On the other hand, the Director of the Road Transport Division of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product approval also has standing seats.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the airplane, the expert says
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a liquid way of driving, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump his head."
"However, if a bus breaks sharply, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says and also believes that this issue is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I'll delete it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to travellers upon boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we're fighting against them right from the start.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he had said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had died, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the stand without flashing and had blocked the bus's ride.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right forepart with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two seats for the stewards were sold.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more detailed regulation of the Stewards movement on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a 30-member expert team from the Ministry of Transport has already been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the road," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activities of the stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In the letter of the WestLB board to the staff of the house, there is no lack of big words.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could arise, says the letter, which became known on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
In general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the hit WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which recently made clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian state government, the time has come to find a solution to the future.
However, a link between the Deka bank, which savings bank customers know about because of its investment funds, and WestLB has been talking about for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
While Deka Bank boss Franz Waas made no sense when presenting the half-yearly figures at the end of August, he did not see any sense in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, which is each run by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenvereinigungen, has instructed the board of directors to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, only just begun, it is said, at the financial centre.
The Deka Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers at the Finanzplatz Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked as if the Deka Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing became of this trio.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian government opposed the Hessian government's involvement in it.
Neither did the other two houses find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there has always been thought about a connection between the Deka bank and Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Executive Board of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to ripen the realization that a contraction of the various houses in the public sector is in need.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, the first step could be to establish a link between the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg and the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
It's not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, she gradually loses the partners for it.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has been much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which holds 85 percent of the shares in the Hesse-Thüringen, put a stop to a merger with the West LB.
At best, the North LB remained.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question as to which business model should ensure the future viability of Landesbanken had not been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be dismantled, but this is of course not desired there.
So the letter of the board there also speaks of the fact that a "total solution" for the house would definitely be sought.
How this can be combined with the merging of individual units with the Deka bank will still be shown.
The second weekend in Wiesn is known as the "Italian Weekend"
For Elena, it's the first time, and for Luca, it's the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded man and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest traveler what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena's gonna give Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," are scheduled to arrive at 6.30 a.m. this evening at 11.45 p.m.
Three buses are reserved for the Italians in particular, while only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing alongside their flag, they celebrated already at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur imitation lining and glasses with wide silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been driving to the Oktoberfest, three tours are this year alone.
At night, on the Wiesn during the day, back at 10.30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 euros costs the journey, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German speaking tour guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero."
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it gets quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian registration numbers take another break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven o'clock in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is giving a final speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First of all, put on the yellow jacket.
On the left is "Oktoberfest," in Fraktur, next to the internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it's called running," Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tips.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the squares, they are gone!"
Third, "Tonight's 9:30." Understood?
And we're going to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for the retreat.
It is the second weekend in Wiesn, known as the "Italian Weekend."
There are no exact figures; there is talk of 50 000 who travel across the Alps and fall into the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors are said to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol, and Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains a nation statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical care.
Especially popular among Italians is the court trump.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasised Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also intertwined that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
Because this has now occurred at the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to pay interest on the part it also claimed.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses to the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he lent money, the state financier had refinanced itself extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial operations fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, the income from attributions to receivables and certain securities, as well as from the liquidation of provisions in the credit business decreased by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements of downstream offset costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regulations and from the business supply for Group companies, the profit minus had remained moderate at around 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been transferred to Aareal Bank.
Because the traditional state financing did not earn enough, the Depfa had then increasingly engaged in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and had diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now carry out depreciation, which will have a "essential material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on the refinancing of the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has again largely dried up, as the banks hoard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds annually for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs will be covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company will be shielded "from the influence of the currently largely non-functional international money markets."
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated that Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope for.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that the funding should not be used to its full extent.
But also the opposite is not to wear out.
After hearing the bank on the late Sunday evening, the at least temporary rescue was still before the bank's insolvency, and it is not possible to calm the mind.
The share price is falling by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite good.
If the priority debt shows little movement, the rates of post-ranking bonds give way more clearly.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds previously appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their validity must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to assume that pensions will be repaid in due time.
Or it happens, which hardly anyone can hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the fact that the reports are spreading with partial nationalization, the probability of security bordering on them has at present become only a legitimate hope.
This should, above all, prepare long-term believers some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors can at least use a final line to make a loss carry forward for future settlement tax payments on the profits of the future years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce himself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of teaching at Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students are infiltrating at eight o'clock, until at twenty to nine a short discussion session begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, nor in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my guest mother, plus blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the desk and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very glad that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all whispered, giggled and waved, and all the time I have heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "low, sweet."
Then I rushed into my place.
The girl next to me was grinning pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stormed.
Everyone talked confusedly and giggled and asked holes in my stomach - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of them unpacked their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunchbox - that's something different from the boring German bread breaks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, lettuce from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Mostly I don't have any idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's a fact that everything's delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which then makes her especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy at a break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious if I can watch this too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I've been reading mangas for years.
And so that I understand the comics and the culture in it better, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here someday.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And you put great value on them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I still haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in case of danger, does that mean that she also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that a lot of animals also have feelings.
Only how could you check if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has published articles by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this until now, where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we may at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, she does the same as many other animals: she turns herself dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, which some scientists conclude is a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of primates and seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor analyzed on the basis of our own experience, because of the special hardware, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which should be more accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially with regard to the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts rather to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I refer them to the fact that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in one of his own conscious brains.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and especially humans.
Linked to the linguistic nature, fine gradations of feeling arise, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to ascribe them to others besides ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stem regions are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network had not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-genre sensations.
In theory, I cannot disagree with this, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to feel the same in both cases: How, however, can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in danger if she too feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral resemblance cannot yet prove equal experience.
While the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove that for humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level waves, if one measures the same in rats and humans.
I don't know how I explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I senses, but I don't know if they exist.
You may think this is shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than running against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports the two hosts lag behind.
Even the number of EM stages may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed," said the Ukrainian President of the Association Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Several first division teams had been sentenced to forced descent for manipulation alone last season, after all, even the start of the league had to be postponed at short notice.
Embarrassed Dennis Quaid beats back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her former Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
It foams - and strikes back.
Late Rose War with former marriage couples Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unsightly argument with each other - in public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "For a long time I was unfaithful, and that was very painful."
She had only learned the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's monstrous," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" that "Meg again chews and recaptures the history of our relationship."
It is also "sorry" that the 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of twins.
And so his admissions close with the sidebite: "My life goes on anyway.
I guess I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing well."
Prices for air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were even cheaper up to 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The Company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and saw a significant fall in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most marked in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as the reason for the weak dollar price, which has led to "a decreasing travel desire of American tourists. "
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even keep the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, the trend for air fares also showed an upward trend:
Due to the fuel price increase, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for Economy class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class the price changes were much lower.
In Germany prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the reason for the price fall is the slowdown in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market crumble.
On the other hand, the open-skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, increased competitive pressure.
The tense situation was marked by the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - these were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV will be the leader of the table.
In the Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein, break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play only late and failed with a lift to the bar.
His message was precisely formulated, and she passed over his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-term break was over and most sat back in their seats.
Rieger was the Physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, and enjoys a higher reputation than many of the actors that have passed away.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb with approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
Its order will have sounded similar: Give me gate two!
Implementation did not take place.
"It wasn't all nice to watch today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "more relaxed."
The 1-0 (1:0) was due to Mladen Petric's headball goal (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as class prime.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the Tabellaric intermediate witness is more of a league's unpredictability than the dominance of his HSV.
The team, with their late engagements - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric and the Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - finds itself slow, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the vote
On Wall Street, fear's gonna go down.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily break in by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer recorded a decline of more than five percent at 10.579 meters.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was down by more than seven percent to 1548 points.
At that time, the biggest loser was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs declined by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
Under the rescue plan, funds will be made available for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
But the sum should not be paid out in one stroke, but in stages.
In return, the State should receive stock options issued by the financial companies, which could be redeemed if the exchange rate changes accordingly, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA downside
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not solve investors' doubts.

Despite the rescue action by the Federal Government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier's share temporarily lost three quarters of its value, and Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly under the psychologically important 6000-point mark and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets all over the world fell to their knees.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout would not be enough to re-launch the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.

The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused perplexity in research: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of soon freezing fuel lines, you are now threatened with cold death.
A mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among scientists for years - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been wondering about for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect according to the time-honoured gravitational law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities at speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter represents at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists carried away in Egypt are supposed to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shootout before the release, six hostages were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Ransom negotiations are already under way.
Time and again Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists carried away in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're checking her state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: According to one Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the official.
It was "only a matter of receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather " led to suicide"
The long-standing abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself being reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes together before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "did give up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her home in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, as described by Stephanie's father and mother, of her actions over the years on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged in accordance with the "Public Security Act."
The man was seconded by the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the secure storage of information.
The Royal Procuratorate recommended that the Metropolitan Police should charge the officer for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of Al-Qaeda and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies face B&B costs
After the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could cost more than £80 million.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to cover some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies must raise 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate recovery are now called to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records were recorded in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
Interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per litre more expensive
People on Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they wish to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the February price increase, the wholesale market price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused bail on the charge of blackmailing 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several hovering charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government first grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, as part of her release, it is not clear whether she will be able to remain free if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says that she doesn't have to be bailed because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers argue that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheik Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, said an Awami Alliance leader on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Concerns about the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, says the United Nations.
The United Nations implemented a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or obstruct the thousands of staff carrying out vaccinations.
BskyB loses legal action in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its shareholding in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's acquisition of the stake in ITV was in doubt about the independence of the ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney General's affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The reason for this was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticised the White House official, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations, including criminal actions, have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force the Witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from its offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to regard the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to investigate the allegations of Democratic electoral fraud.
US prosecutors are charged with investigating and prosecuting cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, then head of the Ministry of Justice, was fired because of the dismissals and ultimately resigned.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector-General raised the role of Gonzales critically by bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, giving up his leadership role and showing himself "exceptionally disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former chief advisor to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music award ceremony "Q Award."
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize next week in London during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track for Meat Loaf's Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" lists the nominations for this year's award, after having narrowed its selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there are some songs that go beyond such subjects as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute larynx inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and maybe soon to sell
New York City has thousands of major roads, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others convenient.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time local residents to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street, between Bowery and Second Avenue, without access to Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an active thoroughfare.
There are no road signs either.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-paved Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the block's past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and run the road, what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would be newly paved and that seats would be set up, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson at Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it didn't want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Building Protection Division, said that it was the city's wish to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop rather than manage the property.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened up to Extra Place and the street is probably the most known backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Deadening City"), has published part of the conversation in city history about Extra Place, which was published in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and by rain gutters flying past week-old newspapers. "
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like this recently in an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bunch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they had seldom thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, wet and disgusting.
Bilingual training debate: education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch," Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates on bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Researcher in Caliphonic Studies and Senior Director in the Department of Education Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection."
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of successful completion of school among Afro-American and Hispanic students is lower than for white students" - which is true.
In order to close this gap, Obama's educational plan recommends, among others, a bilingual transition period in education for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Consider, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 amazing 100 percent fourth grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were rated as well in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and practice, on continuous control of knowledge and on an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practises the approach by which the training takes place in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama should take into account, says the head teacher Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches great importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical education.
Mrs Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, said to me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and would not be able to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national associations of imagery have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing on the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures at the New York Trade Exchange fell by 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the price peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, then rising again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were already worried, even though congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from being completed.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis for the time being, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclay's Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place at the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
In a communication to investors, Deutsche Bank analysts have written that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have revised their oil consumption expectations downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he had been in the jet jersey more often than anyone in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two touchdowns that slipped out once as an outside defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't make much effort," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were catching, the defense took apart Quarterback Kurt Warner.
External defender Darrelle Revis caught an accident and turned him into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had won the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot to the 34-0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Quiet Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some think he is the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2 kilometer track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie improved his previous result from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one World Championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left out the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear, which was perhaps exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railmen like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched on long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had spasms in his calf two weeks ago, so he couldn't train for a week.
Apparently, after a break, he came back refreshed and not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for excessively orchestrating his races, avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and placing world records above the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had dropped.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie has made his final appearance to separate himself from Kwambai, who has arrived second in 2:05:36 and has thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
With women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result ever with 2:19:19.
Paul Radcliff from Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has skilfully planned her course by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan female runners pulled out, but overtook after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the excesses of the amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle, there is a quiet city where the pride and complications of Afro-American culture can be seen.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet places, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough fish, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city that describes it - and which made it a tourist destination by taking it to the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the Federal Writer's Project at the time of depression - remains in many respects a very special kind of place.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he is missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many here continue to be tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the town's oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville was long defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and alert.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-also-always fits in with hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men singing songs about their beauty, full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston was brewed into the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers, in a city that even today imagines something about its venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in a large style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult period in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration by calling its decision against the school council in the Brown case "insulting instead of respecting my race."
Inhabitants today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped create space for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors, and artists who ignored prejudice, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves, and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The road project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway enlivened the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused real citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's image.
More and more people arrived, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a peculiarity in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlando's city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back lane in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders in search of Eatonville's history and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other race and race group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, who could use some help according to him.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only drive through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York they speak fluent finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst day of horror work since the stock market crash of 1929.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal tea carts along sidewalks with loud rattles and carrying trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still smurf between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagel on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, because of all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my mandatory course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, already about 20 people were queued.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for directions to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them in front of me, I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license," were queued for the same reason as me.
Contrary to me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say that they treat their customers as family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently bankrupt.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets worth $327 billion, has gone to bankruptcy management, and last Friday New Yorkers went home for the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion worth of savings, was looking for a saving buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shop clerks who stood up before me brought their bar to a bank that is considered a safe harbour, a bank that is responsible for most of the bailout purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing finance in recent weeks.
A woman who spoke on the phone in my Chinese regular supermarket referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and her emaciated-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has departed from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I'm not taking any more risk."
Muslem graves desecrated while right-wing landslide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian Right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to represent the organisation "Cities Against Islamization."
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
The police accused right-wing extremists of burial in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend when extreme right-wing parties were making significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminals consider this to be an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson from the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the news of the tomb desecration that took place when the Muslim Ramadan's religious month came to an end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties that received almost 30% of the votes, stood up for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their electoral claims were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the building of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which state that the extreme right is the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter's Lockout
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, was forbidden from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges set up a six-month lock on Glitter after informing the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Last Thursday, the Kent police were allowed to impose a foreign travel ban after providing the judges with evidence of Glitter's criminal record of sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
Ein Spokesperson of the Court reported: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police at Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from traveling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
As required by the Sex offenders Register, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
The Kent police said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is that it is easier to control someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect Kent's inhabitants, and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimise any risk to the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after a while.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border guards insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and dedicate themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find a typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer depicts a variety of theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the Month of Flamenco's Photography, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day', explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be 'any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.'
Inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', Bauer went on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotómata.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of nearly seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sport' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me too much pleasure in photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of portraits of today's flamenco entitled 'Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is 'a madness'.
He doesn't know yet where the story of the novel takes place and what it is all about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project with which he is engaged is 'a madness' and 'everything indicates that he does not have to write the novel'.
'If I were sensible, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel sometime', so he finished his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the festival's premium Hay Festival and was given her voice by most of the audience, is compared to the old edition of 'Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given sufficient time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which results from 'extraordinary adventure', from 'joy to read' and from 'more experience than before'; how he writes and 'dististant' to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentations, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what 'image images' it is that form the basis for his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', Vargas Llosa emphasized, who claims that it 'creates effects' and 'brings people apart even more', so I asked the writers 'not to leave themselves to lightness' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the celebration in Pozoblanco the weather did not play along: Bullfight parties partly failed.
After the announced bullfighters discovered that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight festival with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be concluded was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was suspended from the unstable weather, so two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second bullfight festival could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a party on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience reacted in his second fight with boo-calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It looked like they didn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A.A.J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of the road after a few kilometers. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to escape via a country road into a forest area.
The Ertzaintza City police finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles to other police departments.
In addition, the officials found that the registration number was 'double', so that it did not match the registration number indicated in the car papers, and therefore there was an additional arrest for for forgery of official documents.
The Ertzaintza City police continue the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as mentioned above, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A. J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be presented to the detention judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
One Witness had observed her trying to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesperson for the California Traffic Police reported to the magazine 'People'.
The Witness explained in detail that Locklear 'pressed the gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses several times'.
A little later, the Witness, who at first probably didn't recognize that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'a fear of living around Locklears'.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the street, blocking traffic.
'She seemed disoriented', so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive drinking was excluded from the first moment. 'As a result of the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and taken to a local detention centre around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, after treatment, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian United Left Association be responsible for Silva's case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one to take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out what action the party must have towards him, who until now sits in the municipal council of Seville as a city council.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases be given maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that the formation has 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
'Sangre de mayo': Herobook by Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' presents the revised version of the Spanish's famous uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros in investment for filming.
In this way, the Cineast tried to 'present a multitude of personalities and social analysis', which he had always admired in the works of the famous novelist, today Carci explained at the beginning of a long list of actors at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
'Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the telemadrid channel as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, assures us that thanks to this film, his 'childhood dream' has come true. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to make a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Above all, because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million put for filming by the autonomous community of Madrid, Garci, as he added, offers the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing the image of 'confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been brought into decline by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that it was impossible to count on funding like 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay could not be shot with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of the film in 'Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual way of working: he stood on the stage with the actors, with whom one first has to rehearse before one starts shooting and for those who had not done casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and giving respect, 'part of the profession of the director of film is to provide help in the theatre and in the cinema, to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' nor, finally, the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
'In the beginning you think you work for the offspring, later you realize that it's only for growth, and now you're happy when you've still produced a film,' Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women's emancipation fighters, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and supported the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the period between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell her life, but to keep her esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The butterfly's dance, for example, seemed like Guajira, or 'the snake's dance' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students for once.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work and I feel very honoured.'
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón, the percussion of El Pájaro, the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in whom he falls in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way about this woman's life, which has become known in places as far as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
'I wanted to recall it, because I think it is one of the women who has an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works today no one knows any more and who therefore appreciates them even less', Bayón claims.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
For example, 'Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, has now reached New York and will be presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The United States can't imagine without Paul Newman
'Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence was written by the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then dominant idea of US cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his thrilling performance and followed it.
Look what it cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he withdrew in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, that was a big blow for everyone.
'What you sometimes feel is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest thrills of his life.'
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
As the 'father' of cinema and fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market reigns, in which the depressed self-esteem of the Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people remain that you can admire, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he virtually embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and, like various losses, suffered both profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country, where it cost him a lot of effort to assert himself against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of amazement beats home high over Hollywood to take regardless of nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of all of us,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to live as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high standards of righteousness, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He divorced one time and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters have the same opinion on earth as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was as proud of none as of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist', they say.
The streets in Madrid are deficient for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called a perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with everything around it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, it would clearly not have gotten through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket picking that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you pick up the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we hadn't left our backpacks before, even if it had been done, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
In addition, in these 40 minutes of waiting time for rain it looked like there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and invade the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip that I got, I can already imagine that the output was incorrectly stamped.
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect road, I would never think of this road.
So I think we'll be dreaming of a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time to come
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technology Conference, organized by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system pays attention to what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place those present in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video 'the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that leads her conversation, and that he is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example the next version of its operating system Windows.
This week they talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or other feature and 'extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many cleverly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of 'windows'.
What is half of what is used in the computer of existing applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, less exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt, and I'll give you a little example.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drinks machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used it for online research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless star performances, we can return to the picture of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had raised heavyweights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend tells that the name formation is connected with sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' surpasses everyone because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (nothing recognizable) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, t-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a pity to use them as underwear.
You're very sexy.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
At present, the Gruz siblings take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also made the presentation of the most important awards in fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this fall/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner for Valentino's honors.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women wear their clothes, how they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything is in one place and these areas have many similarities.
Ever since I was little, I've been excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's to roam around my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Already later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real actor role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you've become 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever when I'm thirty years old.
I think the woman is ripe, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid because of my biological watch.
I've been doing the things I've been trying to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother, because that's what my body wants, and besides, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise it with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and which were shot last year.
That's exactly what it is, and I really want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
All right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the climb to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection for Mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
A lot of things are told about her. I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that they're not true.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do so.
In order to support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can relapse due to alcohol levels, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, installs this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholic, the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Prosecutor General's Office. According to her, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate in it.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers reported more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol were re-driving.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car start when the driver has taken alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, and the costs are borne by the person imposing the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the standard violations already in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, 115 lives are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented by ordinary means, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
Tomorrow, of all events, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time scheduled by the program, next to the Presidential Hangars of Benito Juárez de México DF airport landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias traveled.
The sun went down, but her rays still forced her to use her hand as a parasol to see the royal couple that got out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time. You're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy who surrender honorary sallows.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that there is a thunderstorm expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, yesterday saw her drawings in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are linked to the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother died recently, was pulling himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewelry from ELAH, which were breathtaking. He held himself by the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of Mango's house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because they lent jackets to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has rushed to the store and had a pants and a shirt on which she herself modelled, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a ballet rehearsal hall, so she got in a state of excitement, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, didn't join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that, she showed us her son's photos on her cell phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always creates a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bedcoats and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Stress advice
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic and fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all gathered in a book that says how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse appears the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of turning away from the world of work.
The number increases, however, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga settings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 opportunities to relax' and so comes the calm that the book conveys to the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Whoever thinks that it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, this manual disproves such faith.
In addition, the methods offered are how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes suggested that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be terrified, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speech in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no single reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often relationships are sought with other apparitions in sleep, such as nightmares, panicky anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bed wetness at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be due to very high fibers, stress situations or overcrowding.
Definitely, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency at which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite an opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the utterance is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and consulted by a specialist to check whether there is a problem, which causes fear and in this way comes about.
We said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, pick a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are horrible and a little too wild.
Relaxation methods can be used in nervous children who are recommended to relax to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it's harmless to the child and the next day, it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful Advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, when frightened by a pair of apparitions, it is recommended to seek advice or to find out the reason for the child's anxiety.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you'll hear what it says, but you won't know what it's dreaming and why it says so, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the kid that you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
It causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Houses... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhaus is finally back on track for success on the field.
Without much effort the yellow-blacks won numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-distance shot just passed the angle, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and Fonderflick succeeded alternately with a long-distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foottip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let through the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with two goals won by Riahi and Temporary, and immediately after that with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was exactly right to accept a ball again, which had been fought off in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the Illiam goaltender should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, which meant that his teammates had to continue playing numerically inferiorly.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems to an ill-Hausian elf, which withdrew only a little to 'condens' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen, who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee set up by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached an average of more than €1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesman for the Elysée Palace, David Martinon, "the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness and secure the conditions of employment and the payment of seafarers."
Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by fishermen.
Tuesday morning they led in Morbihan and Calvado's protest marches, causing traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon Peninsula was separated by a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved in the evening the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to be held in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
Indeed, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give in at any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, announced.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and also Sam Mendes said goodbye to the legendary movie theater and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 delivered aircraft this year, despite the impending recession, to be a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, holds its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 delivered aircraft, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider surrendering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering surrendering more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion advanced to it.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained at the AIG.
The assets from which AIG might be separated include its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make sales in order to repay the loans over 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be equally lost.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of the decline in trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final shooting figures, the Nasdag index, mainly concerning technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the plan to save the banks, which was to allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, the deputies refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said, "This is a bad picture that Congress is unable to accept a plan."
'This shows how much the market was counting on this plan', she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be 'too late'.
'If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, ed.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would limit the credit conditions even more,' warned Brian Bethune, Chief of Economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized that she raised the feeling of extreme urgency even more, 'that every day that passes, the ruin of a financial enterprise' in the United States 'brings with it'.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up the banking operations of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing 'not only an American but a global crisis', the analyst of the FTN Financial added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the State Treasury within ten years fell from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and the revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357 percent.
Obama, winner after points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, which was to be followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite handsome, was not 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to which Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is clearly the better figure.
Among the still indecisive voters, i.e. those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner from the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy in the foreground, clearly emphasizing his opponent's 'naivity' with regard to these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he stressed several times.
'I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president', he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican campaign since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being upset.
He placed his ability in the foreground to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world of the United States has.
'McCain still hasn't understood, but Obama has done so', this weekend a democratic campaign campaign opposed, in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that is on the 'American off the road'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words 'middle-sized' or 'workers'.' The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a decisive turning point,' said the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's government, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After stressing once again that he would probably even be able to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully avoided the questions raised by the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (€470 billion), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that an election took place in Minsk?'
Young people and oppositionists demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations in the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't vote at all: 'What good is that if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the failure to grant visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were judged clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn't them.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,' regretted Yuri Potemkin, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
When members of the opposition move into Parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that the turnout figures were too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of the Minsk voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that an election has taken place?' asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to be in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Conversation - Of the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is known that during the 1980s, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross's blood donation service were contaminated with the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public discontent, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and drawing up guidelines to prevent a further catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to give his report, several provinces at that time set up a committee to develop a new system for the administration of preserved blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is in charge of Quebec, and the Canadian blood company, in order to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, almost 38% of people had confidence in the blood canning system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was disheartening.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood canning and through the work in this area during the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before she proudly stresses that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At this time we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman who has been in charge since its foundation in 1998.
'And we had no idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of Krever and Gélineau's reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is manifested by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was without a doubt proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is in danger of receiving HIV - infected blood.
'In other words, you have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was transmitted via a blood can.
I believe that nowadays you can feel comfortable when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore your health,' says the director of Hema-Quebec.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We need to monitor continuously," continues Dr. Décary, before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient supply in addition to a secure supply.
'The demand is increasing because the population is ageing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood supply network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebec's eligible population. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not accepted because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
'With these 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they grow older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep it and get it to become regular donors.
Life today is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation," Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood canning, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only Quebec public cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood from stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand each year.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord decrease as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in semifinals
Montreal's Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first league's elimination games yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders at the second and the quarterfinals at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall score was scored.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the final goal in the 90th minute.
After a first half without goal both for one side and for the other side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for Montreal's formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the pre-and return series on Friday Impact brought a 2-1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-final, Impact will compete with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3-1 loss due to a 4-3 win in the back match in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps still entered the semi-finals with a total score ratio of 5-4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Victory Gate through Kovalev
The Canadian team's number one trio is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec provided two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of all the shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.
'He was too focused in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause. '
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in today's partial election.
'Remove the course of our last major border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday at the General Assembly of the liberal party Quebec in Levis with visual means, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large amounts as during the parliamentary term.
To the press, the Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches lately, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At most some perspectives on what could be done more: especially on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, supported by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charest, the North has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' 'is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our vicinity, it's in us,' he emphasized, as to show clearly that he is trying to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly by its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique Quebec, the James Bay.
'It's ours, it's our future,' he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises, I will resume this position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, 'with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the North', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist MP of Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has begun its work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be 'conversed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it was a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
'Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development mechanisms.
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power plant in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who has achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,' said Jean Charest.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to start operations in 2012.
'This remains between us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which evoked in those convulsive storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has indeed not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
However, he stressed that his schedule was full, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend General Assembly provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'constitutional objectives', which were readily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the 'specificity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition accepted the North Plan guidelines with scepticism.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-launched the policy for the development of Nord-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the liberal government renounced its application.
If she had done so, 'we would have been much further today', Mrs Marois judged Françoise Mercure alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today).
The ADQ has voted in favour of supporting the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
'But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big idea,' said party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from his vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Land
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-Justiz Minister (what irony) in Harper's cabinet, allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a 'sham' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering it with shame, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned who did not bring home their compatriot, who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened to him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, has broken its word and has a child soldier vegetated under inhumane conditions.
The only one who goes down to a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
Exactly this government also closes its eyes to the torture: it does not interest them that after so many years of torment a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and that sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality anymore: one must arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, according to the mind of a head of government, who until today is only supported by the minority (may he belong to the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwell Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company sought a slander lawsuit over six million against three authors and a small media-less publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slander lawsuits, but of the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way is to have a public debate, to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editors of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual settlement that silences the opposite side and also deters anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by billets.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent review teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of Noir Canada's authors with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and yet disregard the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, in the vice-president's world, this word covers only the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the writers and editors of Noir Canada is doing so mainly because it rejects the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as gags (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the truth-finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by Noir Canada's authors.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment we belong to has long known how to control debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate lawsuit by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the university world, as well as to the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified complaint.
Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main points are: better control of Members of Parliament over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new instruments to reduce the number of houses seized as a result of arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The American finance secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market', said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,' said the Democrat.
'This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,' said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who only participated late in the negotiations, were more likely to support the agreement, but not to fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain dispositions to the agreement, especially those to enable the owners to keep their houses and those concerning the salaries of the executives of the companies saved by the State.
'If we ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to which we could congratulate ourselves.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television stations.
When asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The guiding principles I have read show that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at providing taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freeze of financial power and the ruins of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed last week's first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, the dead end is believed to escape.
In order to round off the view for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added which states that if the government should make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which a further 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be passed by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that pay dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to suspend the attachment proceedings relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan, and also to set time limits for the repayment and redemptions paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate will vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, more voices rose yesterday against this plan, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
'It's obvious Washington doesn't understand us,' said Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, to his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to pay.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a congressional group called 'the skeptics' causality', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: we ask Congress not to be under pressure and to carefully consider the way forward,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were again given the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the high-risk property loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In order to compensate, we receive voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announcing. '
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was about to nationalize another bank under pressure from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissistic mirror with his charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and obvious talent have also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly horrible monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 as a result of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, but certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
After all, it reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before having success at the theatre, on TV and soon in the cinema.
This same man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in the 24-hour race of Mans in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward in a showcase relationship since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and sensitive star disappear, whose mystery will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death put cinema lovers in Tamel this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing by with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind again, and the young man, who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Katze on the hot tin roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
There is a much shorter memory (1990) awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Handful of Dirty) by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, re-recorded after his death and made Newman known in 1956.
This friendly gangster in the superb The Sting (The Clou), who was awarded the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through times, that was him.
Still him.
His curriculum vitae combines epochs.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several movie legends who withdrew early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his splendour and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without a sense of humor, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the rolls flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, nasty or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping and rebellion.
As a director, Newman unveiled unknown pages of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness, to this film in 1984.
During the flood of honors that flowed over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said very deeply: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the late actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drift, is now going there.
We often saw him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrettes, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this to be quite tasteless, although at first we found it still funny.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to shooting.
He left a letter with these sentences to his five daughters: 'Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the billing factory of Zusatz &amp; Co.?
On October 8th, the trial of Jáno's contract and his accomplices will begin.
In particular, the accused are accused of involvement in organised crime, grossly negligent harm and business fraud, and of other criminal offences, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds lucrated from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often charged with fake invoices.
State funds and grants from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are expected to have flown partly into the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly into the private funds of individuals.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received, and the associations were not supposed to have fulfilled their duties.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were forged.
The billing blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that tour north of Lake Balaton to which István Lados was sent by Jáno's bid.
In the course of this "exploration tour," Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices about the consumptions in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
The majority of these invoices are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András  Lissabonri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports, according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer restaurant.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by contract and co in 2003, the gastronomy business is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
But now the boss of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed according to the bill.
Apparently, there were no limits to the imagination of the counterfeiters when it came to Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá do not even appear according to the prosecution authority.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told the hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that the documents were fake when documents were presented to him by the Public Prosecutor's Office during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp."
And further: Apart from flaws in form, the fact that the company was said to have accommodated one hundred people was wrong, after they had a total of eleven rooms, which could not possibly accommodate so many people.
Food was also listed on the invoice, but the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The diligent counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they are targeting exclusively offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travels on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as was known in the course of the investigation, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Job Jövőért was incorrect, as the company only charges 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and the employees only issue mechanical invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "accounters" was that in one case they had indicated "transport of goods" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specialising in investment advice, the prosecutor's office informed.
Further formal errors - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors insisted that the invoices never be issued.
Another "mistake" has been undermined by the forgers at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was at the time of its dissolution (2001), when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore stated that he did not issue the invoices himself.
Consciously faked
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they had to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the CEO of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious bills.
The Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also expected to have worked together with contract and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have provided the Foundation Job Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit invoices for the total value of HUF 5 million relating to services not provided.
However, there were also no payments, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which, however, the interested parties have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants comprises persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based but undiscovered fuel and vehicle trading company.
In the period from October to December 2005, this company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of IT components to the total value of HUF about 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation to have issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their own equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatov's explicit wish.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecution assumes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the bill and VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were added to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts for a different purpose.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictitious invoices to the TMA of Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were secured when the Árpád Kemecsei office was searched at the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to make a confession about the procedure of forgery of accounts, as they were already filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the chief accused Jáno's offer decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report extensively on everything several times, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have made a pact with him on the compensation of the majority of the damage suffered by HUF 50 million, and whether it is prepared to accept responsibility in return.
It is quite possible, however, that supplement now plays the "insulted" after his requests for relief of imprisonment and house arrest had come upon deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have caused far greater damage to economic crimes and have not paid for them, are at liberty, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The psychology of surpassing - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the offer.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves up in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lottery while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brain cortex, was measured in the losers of the auction, in which the opponent's outburst plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also conducted research into the pursuit of the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their operations.
Another group was also promised $15 reward, in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was just that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the group playing "against losing" were prepared for higher stakes than those in the control group or the "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the behaviour observed at auctions has so far been based only on the joy of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation available," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor go?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis virus spreads in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to use vaccination against the viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two-three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
Afterwards, jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the far more severe diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people are infected in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have had blood transfusions before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time organized by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
According to the latest research, religious faith seems like a kind of "pain cure" that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: the extent to which faith in God influences human pain, the British paper "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
The results showed that the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it was even proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with Hermelin."
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance, while they chose da Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were to watch either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported that when they saw the Mother of God, they felt "in security, " as if they were" cared for, " and they felt "rest and peace. "
While viewing the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they saw Leonardo's work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be created with other, strong-acting images in the atheists, one simply had to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find a picture that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practising faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does," says Wright.
After these outstanding results, there remains only the question of what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain control of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with justice: it can be found in people's pockets as well as over their heads in the sky: She knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he says: These would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about the users and thus get closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information in this world."
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really fits me?" but software programs are not yet able to do so because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered in the course of their internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which the search was made and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later to use it so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends customized products and services based on the previous preferences.
However, the users are wondering what happens in the event of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some people are worried about whether the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which is frightening, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against power, which encounters rejection in many internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of paedophilia.
However, users worried about personal rights could still breathe in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully brought the FBI to justice: therefore, in the future Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request with any point in the constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the youth protection law passed years ago, but the list of individual users, respectively their web and search term list, was withheld retroactively for two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who hate to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using the Google services, scourge the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "Geek culture," which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes from its users, and its services provide them free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been brought to the fore, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0."
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, i.e. the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show oneself publicly.
An average teenager can manage his profile at the same time on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, they can connect it to each other through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are hosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove that when looking at the party photos of the past night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee is dismissed because in his blog he is only too honest about his anger about corporate management - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he reveals of himself - for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And if you try to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google Monopole, you're welcome to do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but intentionally leaves no trace.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they can't be found, but also Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapid introduction of services is causing not only Microsoft but also other software developers headaches.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing opposite poles: for example, the Executive Committee rejected a protest by the employees completely after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also felt that the staff's multiple meals were too expensive. However, all this seems to be mildly against Google's even falling to its knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreeing with an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could turn back a lot: While some think Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is now assuming that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are more concerned about the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of Sci-Fi authors with the material - for example, "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best Orwellian manner in which a person becomes frighteningly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd with the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people suspected of helping with the removal of the traces, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were informed and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to the MTI news agency, they are two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to an area in Ózd where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act by long hand - this is also proven by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Announces Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were formerly excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the securities in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily "E15," Poland's offer includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
The newspaper reports that the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not exclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European papers already spoke of the "second 11 September" on Tuesday.
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to put his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11."
Parts of the Madrid press also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not have any political means for crisis management.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva "day indicator" means.
While some states could still provide bailouts to their troubled financial institutions and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weak financial institutions, the Viennese "Der Standard" recalls. Moreover, according to the newspaper, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, after the Americans, European taxpayers now have to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which now sweeps over the old continents like a tsunami.
While the "saviors" would not immediately have to "walk" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of bumblebees
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
Like the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in the creation of new accident-avoiding systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by auto robots, a mini-car equipped with the bees' characteristics, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "protective shield," said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the auto robot immediately changes course, similar to the bees' movement by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it weren't, the car robot couldn't react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Autorobot Project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology is the most intuitive and vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the bees' behavior when avoiding other bees.
And this has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the evasiveness cannot go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the maneuverability of the tires.
While there are infinite possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotational movement, respectively the acceleration and braking of the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh said it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process some inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It doesn't have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous maneuvers, so it takes up only a handful of KB memory on an ongoing basis.
There's no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could be the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the $700 billion bail-out package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims to buy the banks' bad loans.
In the first run half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight on the east coast, Congressmen came to an agreement on the $700 billion bailout after several days of debates, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, and said that the agreement had to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - supported the compromise reached on the rescue package.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson concluded that the programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this would not be about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington's time Sunday evening 8:00 (mid-European time Monday 2:00 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-rise on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft legislation to stabilise the economy of 2008, then it will be the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on buying lazy, credit-loaded securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress will vote on the Causa on Monday, as expected. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-loaded, bad securities, and the President is to decide on the further USD 100 billion.
The programme will be reviewed by a separate Commission, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision by Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "poisonous" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and companies pay the appropriate fees for the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, be it for large-scale purchases of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law once it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the chiefs of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect the government to shorten their clearances, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps out.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys at an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed unless the deserving head of the bank is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of lazy loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managers' salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers' salaries are regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in participating banks, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank gets better.
The draft law requires the President to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect us to do, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says Darrell Issa, a Californian Republican.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for Wall Street's collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year's prices.
Due to domestic and export price changes, output prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices rose only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also increased only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, and for footwear, prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased the prices of chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
Crude oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as wood processing (0.1 per cent) recorded a fall in prices.
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the year-on-year comparison, crude oil processing prices rose most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in food, drink and tobacco production was 11 percent.
Price decreases were observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and electrical and technical equipment (0.3 per cent).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7% compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase (0.7 percent) was recorded in August in the fixed assets sector.
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 percent) compared to the same period in 2007.
In the consumer goods sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, while in the capital goods, a price reduction of 1.4 percent was noted.
Industrial export prices measured in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a fall of 3.9 percent year-on-year.
Compared to the euro, the domestic currency fell by 1.7 percent, the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the August 2007 exchange rate, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, while the dollar was even 15.9 percent stronger.
No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to come into force around the 12th of January, as the Foreign Minister told the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now only depends on the timely introduction of the electronic immigration or control system in overseas countries."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will present her to the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the $700 billion bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning, the Congress and government representatives announced that they had reached an agreement on the banking bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain's Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has melted at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly adopt the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolet."
In an interview given to ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have a hard time grabbing (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of handling for top managers - something he had insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas Obama was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article "Bayern's Revolution Eliminates their Fathers."
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the break in the epoch is a problem of Christian democracy, as is the problem of Angela Merkel.
The CSU's disaster did not come as a surprise, but something came to an end on Sunday, which, however, was already evident ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU ended up at 47.7 percent and fell below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in other words in the much quoted Stoiber era.
Last but not least, the modernization carried out by the CSU in the federal state has wiped out its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but had considerably underestimated themselves at the pace. However, the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain without impact.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in the last few weeks, the classic groups of citizens have been saying the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school degree.
Here, the support of the CSU dropped to even under 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders reserved on coalition issues" titled articles about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ's interference in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television the party leaders hardly let their cards look.
SPÖ boss Werner Faymann reiterated his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP boss as Vice-Chancellor.
As he said, the voters voted off the bowl-molter course.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
Molterer has, however, reacted carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to interfere with the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is going into opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by ÖVP.
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which this year will be hosted by the EU Presidency of the Council of the European Union in France.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party, drew particular attention to the segregation of education, as it is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and it is also the greatest obstacle to their application.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Fidesz Press Office, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma were mainly displaced from the labour market because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths do not have middle-school education, and poor primary education means that only a small proportion of them can achieve a university degree."
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which would have a key role to play in asserting other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU member states.
In the opinion of the MEPs, it is important that these connections become as broad a circle as possible - Roma and non-Roma.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase, and through income and VAT they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the right to high-quality education must be guaranteed to the Roma - the bad and segregated teaching must be stopped," said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a joint, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of de-regation in the education sector, and to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly respected.
"We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic means to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," said Járóka.
Since last year's congress in Berlin, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, in the spirit of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities."
CSU: Mercy for Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, for the time being no heads are rolling, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party congress last weekend in October.
However, the duo, who had been tortured, had already made it clear that it didn't want to stick on their armchairs.
They want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is at his peak in his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "all-in-one" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
While the Conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructurings, the potential successor Huber's, Vice President and Federal Agrarian Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which conducts exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, respectively the right-wing "free voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the "Free Voters" list, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo used first, and then mercilessly serve off the determined politician.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings from the background, will play an active role. Former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called September 28 "the bitterest day of his political career."
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a great deal to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on track with a joint force act, Merkel cannot again become chancellor after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the loss of terrain of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Socialists and Democrats will continue.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition has made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
Although the ten million-inhabitant state's legislature has been without opposition for decades, the opposing party, which had gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), had seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who had already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time during the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "let" some members of the opposition in parliament this time.
That is why the ODS has even abandoned the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent thanks to the rising prices of gas imports from Russia. In order to alleviate the price increases, loans have even been raised, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. Thus, in the background of the opposition's expectations, Ukraine hopes to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system in the EU.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided a temporary relaxation, emphasising the positive movements rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the Rapid Report of the OECD already criticized the campaign on Monday - so oppositionists should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, considers the two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich said to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament."
The opposition is not planning any protest measures in view of the results, but rather is trying to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We are struggling with many problems here - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way in sales, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," said Milinkevich in allusion to the fact that not even the most supported class of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that is reminiscent of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, not the words." The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those smart people who first stamp and then go out drinking coffee during working hours.
The new anti-lazy law was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
">"Twisting doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," Minister Brunetta said.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta underlines once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises on this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders."
During a meeting of the Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione
of Rome the minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people per year are more present at work."
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"Their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate over the last 8-10 years."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for the Civil Service is profiling himself with figures on lower absenteeism at work - according to the Consumer Centre - the people of 'working lazy people' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker during which verification visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day 2,500 accidents at work occur in Italy, three people die and 27 people remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as those caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Laworo) will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work in all the provinces of Italy in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of workplace prevention is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to the support of the families of the victims and to the awareness of public opinion."
"A outraged "basta" has risen to this; understandable in the case of tragedies, which, in terms of their magnitude, trigger some vortexes in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of the role of young people in the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness. One must put into force and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on firm rules that aim to put an end to the problem."
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," emphasizes President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's what ultimately causes the tragedy."
"We believe that we are doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents, and we can fight it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary - according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to inform the workers who are already starting at school."
"A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency is needed."
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the victims of accidents at work" and denounced "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years."
"The aim is, therefore, to give the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which from time to time are decided by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the EU's Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks).
"The report, according to a note, makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years more than one hour a day per week risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people, who usually place portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - it is said on the part of the Eu - there is a clear risk that pushes for quick action.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information a common good.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
In view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people, Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee.
"Scientists - the EU communication concludes - confirm that we are quite concerned and that the Eu Commission, together with the other Eu-members and stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard, which limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from excessive noise pollution.
One can limit these damages very much, in which one reaches solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise output.
In their report, the scientific committee of the Eu points out that when users of portable music devices listen only five hours a week loud ( louder than 89 decibels) music, so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This therefore affects 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, we're supposed to be over in March, and we're taking stock in June.
This is the process laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome," and the Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the leadership lines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - Alemanno emphasizes. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the City Council and the Municipal Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a timed end point.
In June - as the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will make use of the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence, because they lack a sense of commitment, reply Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in view of working seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think. It will occupy the best minds of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to enable our city to make a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future."
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, "which will not only be limited in the current municipal borders but will look much further," not only in terms of Rome's role as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama - the first anti-American president? Here's an explanation
A well-known American politician, who is keen to be regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the USA and maintained relations with the hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private man). "
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, right now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
Actually, however, these attacks don't have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the electoral booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here comes a mentality of the USA, which was kept hidden until last.
"Say what you want, then we'll decide who we're gonna make our creek for, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before - only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, for the majority, Iraq remains the weak point of Bush.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control over the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern at the general credibility of the information concerning the persons responsible.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the big problems caused by the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to put together the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved - according to the journalists interviewed - if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even at 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The most important publishing groups make their way to the Internet, which many consider to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they want to join the new technology in the hope of "bringing something good for journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are certain that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work."
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
It's 30% for journalists.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our editors, ed.) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as the US are, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers offer as it is popular to them and so it will be a matter of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10000 euros per month, as well as pension and insurance money.
As far as holidays are concerned, things get complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 days of holiday after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA CLEARS IN GROTTAFERATA
The President of the Second Trial Chamber of the Tribunal in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the motion of the real estate agent who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is found against Coppola for Bankrot in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor's office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and obtain evidence indicting him.
The elite are in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion-dollar White House savings package: a large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in progress divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favoured state institutions and the business community, and those neo-conservatives who are hostile to "them in Washington" and the financial world and, above all, win voters in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its ascension, above all, to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the US, also throughout the West and perhaps beyond it will be affected by it.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: how to behave towards the families affected, which is an enormous number of voters.
So the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but politically, it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen into the dark in itself and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two conditions that cannot be overvalued - under certain circumstances - which otherwise no international organisation or market will be able to rely on in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance recently associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now that we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked global realm, a realm of increasingly differentiated technologies, of intangibles, that we suddenly have to determine how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other in the world, but are nevertheless connected to a closely circumscribed piece of earth - a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short insertion.
Whoever says territory, who government, who politics also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation about the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in some sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerantness, an image of inexpensiveness, a sense of distance, all directed towards a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
The conviction among large sections of the population seems to pave the way, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is presented to the majority as increasingly alien and more advanced.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of disempowerment of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolutions" of voters and in the unmediated change of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value as to what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today and is being intensified from the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses."
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that blows up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached its goal.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 sq.m., the researchers succeeded in fixing a body weighing 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged into a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass Teflon and sanding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding ability of the reptile's feet and at the same time "can easily be removed from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Like Spiderman, it's like going up on walls? Perhaps, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could be in the space sector.
So for now, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH - including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibres that cleans itself of the dust like hair by moving on a surface and thus always preserves perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in the summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time with certain vital drugs, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices in connection with medication intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again raised the alarm: it is enough for a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines, such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
In a report two years ago, the same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mix and stressed the need to take care of what is being drunk with drugs such as Diazepan or Metadon.
IT'S NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba, Director of the Statale di Milano University, appealed: "Such results are usually immediately passed on to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to read the package leaflet at all times and, if there are still uncertainties, do not be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the Ansa agency's expert.
Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in an editorial of the New York Times that this second event had been more crucial to the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction, which received not a little polemic in response and was held before the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economy of great value," but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The OpenOffice.org 3.0 release date has come; as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, the open source software gains an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the audience with some innovations: in addition to a revised and now spartan-designed initial menu, a completely guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x has finally been achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight of them were also compared to compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by several hands by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each processor is assigned a frame to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result will be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
However, if freedom of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the programme in private households, it is also in the field of business, where OpenOffice could succeed in the big challenge: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases in place of the better known access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads - a goal that can easily be exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Kohl also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new Dopingfall mi frame of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is third-classed and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who has been tested positive for Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this was the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-rehearsals now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME CHANGE: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of the emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants," which are accepted only with reluctance.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the theme of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young, Burkina Faso-based Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case bears witness to what the Times call the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and job opportunities exist," yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North" is recorded.
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times invokes further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the last survey by the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples and 600 euros in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious proportions. In fact, a whole host of students lose their right to study, because their families are unable to support them at this level," says Laura Mariani, who is responsible for Sunia, "in these cities, the great demand from students leads to a deformity of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limit, unauthorized sub-renting.
There is a need for exceptional measures for Sunia, which lead to lower rental prices by revising taxation.
On closer examination of the study it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the neighborhood Brianza is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the neighborhood Nere) and ends at 800 euros in the neighborhood Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the neighborhood Vittoria.
In Florence an average sleeping place costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, are 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
The rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome are only slightly lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who avoid in outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350 euros.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they are more important in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting out to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: foreign students are required to rent 25-30% more than the average.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-saal complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the one-saalkino in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the traits of cultural crime.
Most of them are affected by historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom one has covered a piece of street full of emotions," according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso," who 20 years ago brought him the Oscar and the great prize of Cannes. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a world of cinema that is probably lost forever.
The figures supplied by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; most of these cinemas paid for in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: at 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy lists, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also emerge, but first of all the preservation of the already existing one, because if a hall closes in the city, not all of its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association outside eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros in the year would be needed."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of the fears surrounding the old cinema halls, decided to protect it by an agreement between the municipality and Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax advantages for cinema operators, as well as benefits for the public regarding local transport: it will be allowed to travel to the limited traffic areas of the centre and to park at more favourable parking fees.
"It is a pleasing initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
But certainly we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso," even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass by the Rialto or Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside in order not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the community's decisions to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia group.
The charges against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew were also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm disregarding," writes the lawyers, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Priomalli money for consulting activities."
"It was thus made possible for the Mafia group - according to the judges - to enter the town halls on an official way and to agree on the politics of public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places in which the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others in which such links are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest'.
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, which according to the police of the Clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration - the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 election.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called on Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, declare that the Priomalli clan had even dared to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
From an interrogation in connection with the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - thus making the public administration's actions identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly rise
It is a non-destructive source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet's surface, and only now do the world's big energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also seeking to occupate, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; it is not by chance that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980 the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by ocean wave energy.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also the currents and tides.
Giants at the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector that rely on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" - according to the spokesman of a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal - and weighs the possibility of working with us."
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that cannot be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being extracted by the US in Alaska, and that President Bush has just begun plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; even the details are not known, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Technologies that are still worth improving.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still emerging, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been resolved.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small scale and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with far greater influence on the environment are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned facilities of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parklatz using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feeds the generator by the resulting rotational motion.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorization to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, special interest is immediately worthy of the potential that is in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is the tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
