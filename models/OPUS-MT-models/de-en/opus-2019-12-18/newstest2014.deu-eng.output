Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation - in sight of the older town hall lamp.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or strike?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The city hall light was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light secures both cyclists as well as bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic there had to be another traffic light for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of Offenburg.
"According to current measurements on the B 33 approximately 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is simply going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been held, a roundabout was also planned, but because of the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested at the location of the traffic light masts before: "By means of an extra transporter loaded with particularly long logs for us, we have tested whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending over the traffic light mast."
The approximately 15,000 euro traffic light system itself is the "most modern thing on the market," explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs, which shine so strongly that the lights can be easily recognized by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is clear, it comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"If a group or disabled person walks across the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will come safely across the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think here as a partner and observe the roadway.
This was not the case yesterday: the traffic light for pedestrians showed green, a top-class vehicle leaked through - in bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the lack of speech, the tendency to rude violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have often been described by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is known above all as a prose author, theater texts are rare in his work.
Collage from prose texts For his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue," which can now be seen in Garage X on St. Peter's Square, Gerhard Fresacher thus compiles a collage of prose texts.
The theater maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der serfigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which allusion is copied and masturbated - the eight-member ensemble shimmers through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the original with a wealth of directing ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic playing forms.
Especially the actresses come to it with the sometimes questionable scenic realizations.
They are touched hard, dived with their heads under water, tacked to the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stagger on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologue them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this hard way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
Only towards the end, the overwhelmed performance gets a little rest, and Winkler's absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every mile and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the State Planning Offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometers travelled - and possibly also where they were driven - and then use the information to calculate tax rulings.
The Tea Party is terrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about data protection.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we're just gonna use," Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, said, planning a record of miles driven by all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the taxes paid by the Americans at the pump, is bankrupt.
But America doesn't have as much fuel as it used to be.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians at high fuel prices do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally established goals of the state on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay after the distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move towards mile-based settlement.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of representatives from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and big cities still move on their own in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage tax instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of their movements.
"Remembering Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full-blown monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometers travelled, but not exactly when and where.
According to Khan, the public would also be more reassured.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states in the taxation of motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles they drive.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot schemes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and pay a flat fee instead based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees, pay insurance for miles only, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles that allow drivers to avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Head of Legislative and Public Affairs of the Commission.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats themselves bravely
The volunteer fire brigade managed their autumn main rehearsal despite lack of personnel with flying colours.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
There is said to have been a short circuit during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the smoke development, but one of them could still send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the weir agreed to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him out into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow stairway was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first fire attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made via an overfloor hydrant about 100 metres away.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what is to be done with little staff at his disposal.
In case of emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld daily operations group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf also explained in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he investigated this important question together with the leading school leaders of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parents' council chairman.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasized Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Center Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre in the Waldstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness of the county.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," said Wolf.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were caring for and caring for their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose skilled labour, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often retain the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Landtag expressed his conviction.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of public transport.
"Continue to remain persistent and make public transport better," he explained to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a vesper.
In the past, the elderly were hosted in the resting place.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The home residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as a front line of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße before the renovation is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed during the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, in order to stabilize and static relief of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further approach is to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, who will then be placed on the table of the municipal council for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old Schulinnenhof within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to renovate the wall from the ground up and place it on new substructures in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historical, one hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, need to be renovated and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fixing work.
Originally the schoolyard renovation was planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the Landesdenkmalamt.
Should regulations come from this side, then the city hopes for grants from the conservationists.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with new auditorium, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also taken part in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir said to the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten."
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
Thus Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the Jazz and Pop studies will be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to the U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
According to the data, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig through under the radar," said the Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in relation to drug crime in Mexico.
Designed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electric vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres down to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
He would have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was caught for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum sentence of lifelong deprivation of liberty, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego continued.
But it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
Bill Sherman of the DEA drug squad in San Diego said that this was the "distortion" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one was Mexican, they said.
You must expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary.
Return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is due.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On the 15th of March there will be an official prelude to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this prelude event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were first mentioned, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, numerous events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in church houses.
Church Houses will be held in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend there is also the Church-Hausen church festival.
Stadtmusikdirektor Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sonnwendfeier of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date will be on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will also be published on the occasion of the Geisingen City anniversary.
"However, it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the geising of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's geising also celebrates its birthday in 2014; in 1974 today's space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Fool's guild Strohglonki starts on February 8th with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen is 90 years old and has the banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisingen School has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this during the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which at that time was a court place.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014 is 40 years ago.
Council targets track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the council has decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros into his hands.
The Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - collisions of trains with other vehicles occur regularly throughout Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must take part in the costs with one third, the rest share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city architect Roland Sehlhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the "Am Hirschen" river crossing.
There the city plans to build a bulwark at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could stand on counter-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Sehlhaber therefore proposed that a necessary retaining wall be constructed in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for street distribution: Thomas Kipp pointed out the mood of the critics: "Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Given that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel had to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to investigate the costs of the proposed widening of the road.
Despite this, the majority of the participants agreed to the renovation of the railway crossing with the condition that the necessary retaining wall is built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 metres for meeting traffic, if necessary.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could lead to a very different problem, which affects the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg."
The administration had the railway's reconstruction plans examined by the Breinlinger engineering office, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the road's tilt conditions could lead to longer vehicles being in service.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road load carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the bending functioned in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
Also at this point the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition was significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because directly next to it is the stop center, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point so far that no collision was imminent.
The majority refused to agree to the reconstruction of this railway crossing, since the city of Schiltach had to "bath" the problem with stationary vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The board considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" to be unproblematic, for which crossroads with the railway have already been concluded.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years.
30 suggestions were available, five are still in the race.
Faraway worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether or not there is life on some of them, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should one look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or looking for earthlike planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are supposed to make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of which have now come to a close.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will start in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity will be examined more closely.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered as indicators of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately provide information on the conditions for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system plays an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated as examples.
With the "Solar Orbiter," the Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe should start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa plans the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
Besides the common matter, which consists of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
Until now, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid," the Esa has already approved an M-mission, the launch of which is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa" has the best chances of being granted an L-mission, a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
By this physicists understand changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They haven't been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that were created at the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which is to explore black holes among other things, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
Suggestions for retrieving samples from Mars, for the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to "co-operate" with Germany with regard to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of fidelity and tries to criminalize political opinion with a threat of punishment, in which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The US Department of Justice's prosecution includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, Member of Parliament, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States."
Ströbele, a Green MP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele stated that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia when he left the country.
If Snowden claims in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, according to the MP.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians - including in the United States - have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier stated that if the fee was paid in advance, 25 US dollars would be charged, and 100 US dollars would be charged to travellers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines started charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee wasn't really about making money.
It was about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who had clearly stated that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at Frontier's boarding gate may be allowed to take a piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed, so passengers would be informed of the fee before they came to the boarding gate.
Frontier's new hand baggage fee will only come into force in summer, but there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage should cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, leave the fingers of fees for hand luggage up to now.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner, followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, explained airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand baggage fee would be $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious what he would expect at the boarding gate if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing teeth and tangible discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding went like smeared."
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the whole can and that coffee would be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to ask for money for soft drinks, but reversed this seven months later, after passengers complained and no other big company had followed.
Frontier's step in charging for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to get passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route.
A flight trip booked by a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively when buying directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity decreased almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier under control as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs Come From the Bible
About 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish hall was "Bible proverbs " and" medieval expressions. "
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, gave a lecture on the Bible proverbs.
"Proverbs contain wisdom of life, regulations, or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: Wood eye be watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, an eye cast on someone, whom the Lord gives in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also let her listeners guess what the saying was.
The church secretary Christel Dehner took care of the medieval phrases: all good things are three, do blue, mess things up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges into the past."
Finally, a tombola was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, the mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger also mingled.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry will be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with qualifications," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits were manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurants Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA declares that an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had paralysed its public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight as an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spy agency explained in an e-mail message.
The problem will be fixed that evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman had told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, according to the spokesman.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The previously super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (no such authority), is now found in the bright light of the public and is exposed to sharp criticism after the revelations of its extensive surveillance program in Germany and abroad, which have become known in recent months - a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over intelligence fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of targeted cyper surgery.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1.307.
Although the rate was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted cautiously in the case of hiring.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the crafts, in health care and in the care of the elderly."
Due to the seasons, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have also been running again since September.
The winter season starts there in mid-December.
You will find the full background report in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt from 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profit in Bombardier after decrease in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decline in net profit on Thursday after falling orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the rail sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could enter commercial use next September in accordance with the ambitious timetable.
The test aircraft's maiden flight a month and a half ago was followed by only three further launches, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday with a view to the stock having a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery figures for aircraft were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer's letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
So far, however, binding orders for CSeries have been moderated by 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are accurate.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
Corporate governance also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," said Beaudoin at a conference call, adding that during the service life of the aircraft ground tests and software updates were set.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to make a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we have also done.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, the rest shortly afterwards, it said from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical about whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can put a CSeries aircraft into operation.
Bombardier stated that it will review the planning for commissioning (EIS) and update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardier's internal planning - strengthens our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly and dropped from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims to have delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace sector amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within the framework of our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment have increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September and was thus slightly higher than on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some large contracts.
According to management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier share declined by 8.5 percent and amounted to 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will change to the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management informed Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
Media also reported several injured people.
US President Barack Obama is kept informed of the situation, said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travellers would have yelled and children would have cried.
Among the waiting people, panic broke out, many had hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
A security officer from TSA had suffered a gunshot wound on the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie."
Afterwards, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
TV pictures showed how many ambulances and police cars were driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter published photos of a Special Operations Command and a rifle lying on the ground.
The airport management reported on Twitter that the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, formed long backslides.
With the exception of landings, it was said that air traffic had been temporarily stopped.
However, several airplanes were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpooler Crown Court
A well-known criminal defenseman who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash," who was praised by criminals as "first-class," was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials observed Scarborough (32) delivering three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed information on to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool's Crown Court on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted the cocaine possession during an earlier survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out during their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs under the lawyer's trash can with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough made regular calls to Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests had discovered Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to the "lawyer secret."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office at his private address as well as at work, and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court it became known that he had called important actors in the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
State Attorney Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a defense lawyer, as he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted as far as possible against the police investigation, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta discredited his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, then I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but would do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases of possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the song wreath Dunningen will frame two divine services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life," which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two divine services with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe at the end of the Jubilee Year.
On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary mass will be held at the evening mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10.15 a.m. at the divine service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Sacred Sacrifice of the Mass," D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is presented in the framework of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Scepticism gives way to growing confidence
The elections to the parish council in 2015 will, for example, change fundamentals in the pastoral unit of Haslach (SE).
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing to change the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new gives way hesitantly but increasingly to a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral team ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral services in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the pastor Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented in each parish, and so-called community teams are to be formed in the six parishes on site.
Their task in the future will be to promote church life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parish was then subject to considerable discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes will be retained for purpose.
On the other hand, liabilities are transferred to the general public.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which is then made by all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the parishes alone were invested," Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach put into perspective.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of "Become one, stay five" in 2006 and had to realize that this is not so easy.
The bodies of the Haslach chaplainry unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be finalised at further meetings and adopted at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year is added to a family of four members.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is fixed each year in October by the four operators of the major lines of electricity.
These calculate the additional costs they incur as a result of the energy transition, which they can levy on the price of electricity by means of a levy.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
According to Jörg-Arne Bias, the Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform its customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number more close to the 2 cents.
Traffic light on permanent red: watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the sign of light is defective.
Then what should you do - drive in red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad."
However, the waiting period had to be "adequate," which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic light is expected.
However, if you continue the journey despite red light, you must be aware that it is entirely to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who are tolerated for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refer to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the case under negotiation, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
Municipal Council is pleased about sound budget
Every time municipal council meetings are about the budget, mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality of Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not been familiar with debts since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be considered as a complete success.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget with around 7.6 million euros was more than one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at around 1.8 million euros, was also around one million euros above the target.
The surplus was mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The wealth balance was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
Since less investment was made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the allocation of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"You don't shake such a work out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the financial statements.
He and the municipal councils were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon find themselves expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to dispense with high lifting rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, this in turn has often reduced subsidies from the country.
These subsidies from various compensatory funds are subject to conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain rates of levy.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting kits, as in the coming years investments are in the pipeline for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's history at the Men's Singing Association Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of Herbsfest, in which he was honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir, which is now probably more than lovely.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and his loyalty to the club: Jörg Kohr, pastoral consultant on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate from the Association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st Fall Festival took place in the usual stages: with the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had invited a colourful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Funny, Brothers."
For their honorary singer Hubert Wermter they prepared a little chorus - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied."
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jäggräufen" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du Übergehenst durchs Tal."
With his mixed choir and women's group - the "Impulschor" - the song wreath Salzstetten provided for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
With "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied," the singer department of the Baisinger Sports Club came back to home, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children occupied over the noon.
Children's Dreams Become True
The kindergartens and day care centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and beautification requirements.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centres and crèches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messengers.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many diligent construction workers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press indignant about controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves: what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be prejudiced because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government uses the new law to "take the media effectively into a stranglehold," while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a heavy blow," and called the draft "draconian."
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew the anger of the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras showing the alleged looting of the luxurious shopping mall by the units sent to the scene.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan schillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single punishment can drive most radio stations into bankruptcy. "
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "lively blogosphere" in their description.
If they were to silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want unpunished.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"Leave politicians to themselves, lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already caused public trouble in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and re-inforced their hearty salaries of about 532,000 shillings each month, which are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field did not lose any significance for the city and the football club.
Everyone wanted a more pleasant ceremony last Saturday, but Peter didn't want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or who couldn't hold one for some reason had the prospect.
This was done by the musicians who framed the festive act, as well as by many speakers.
So the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, became wet.
His thanks were first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the participating companies and association members who made their contribution.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable volunteering was also appreciated by the state parliament member Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn were such that the original lawn square could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations for the solution of the problem, when the construction of a third place in the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was thought of.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about creating an artificial grass sports field, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in hereditary lease, agreed to a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356,000 euros to the total cost of 560,000 euros, summarizing Klumpp.
The construction of the 68-by-108-metre artificial grass square began on 4 June.
During the construction phase lasting over three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt-bike route.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on home affairs and justice.
To this end, the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, we are talking about direct democracy, bribing of MPs and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, the issue of dual citizenship should be dealt with, in which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the coercion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD confirmed its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threats of alternative traffic on rural roads, which are already focal points of the accident.
Moreover, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hairdryer wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be really summer again?" wasn't the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the picture gallery to see the "singing hairdryer wave."
Drivers seriously injured in an accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was headed towards Grefrath with her car on the Kempener Außenring at around 9.15 pm.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the 37-year-old's car.
The eye collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: closure after accident at the Schänzle Kreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibizas drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenau road on Thursday evening, around 8 pm.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged behind the BMW.
A total of around 15000 property damage occurred, the police reported.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future, there will be no more announcements like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
Much of the loudspeaker announcements thus fall away - the noise level should thus be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individual persons.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers in one day - it should be quieter in the future at the airport.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flight routes or departure times are a bit lost here," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander Games will start at 1:30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabian in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket yielding.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be thrown vertically, should one turn over and then just come to the reclining.
This is assessed with the most points.
Horseshoe throwing depends on the accuracy of the target.
From eight meters away is thrown on a stake.
The participants must demonstrate skill and strength when carrying water over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a tub are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Can be trained from 10 o'clock.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Schottenrock.
But also Swabian costume is allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is already announced on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the brass music lovers get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m. the Birabohmic brass music from Schömberg is shaping the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays Polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be present for a while underneath the gutters.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Fool's guild.
On Sunday the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for early chopping, from 2 pm the Böffingen peasant chapel is a guest, and the "oldies" then let the festival end.
The start is already on Friday the stopcoat party with DJ Ralf.
On Saturday and Sunday there will also be a meeting of vintage cars and tugs, exhibitions of companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the craftsmen's market and sheep scissors.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor driving (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein multipurpose hall, the Skiclub and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele."
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan diet requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with vegetable cream is, for example, a quark substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation calls further on World Vegetarian Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Confederation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt let replace with soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oats, almond or rice milk could be used.
Punchable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mush or a tablespoon of ground flax seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
For example, doughs are loosened instead of eggs with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of dietary strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people are currently eating vegan in Germany, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald-Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here there was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special appeal in the evening light.
Due to the time difference the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided on in Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, the financial center around Wall Street went to the memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, students from the 373-meter-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city while enjoying the view.
Afterwards it went through the bustle of the streets of New York via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to linger briefly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the day of Saint Hubertus's name, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was, according to the legend, a quite ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe der Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The winds wear riding clothes because they accompany mainly riders, horses and dogs on tow hunting.
The Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and to return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to the lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the homonymous café at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to remain in the pure feeling of Déjà Vu.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has exactly that as its goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but also to make it tangible to be experienced again and again.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look inside at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually served fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves already before the opening of the beautiful cafe at Opschlag as a gastronomy: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge."
From moving to Kleve to the Opschlag, the friendly café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least by the university.
"Where we do not have a specific target group," stresses Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here would like to address young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew itself in various variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
There were two events already in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the wrestling night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner isn't quite a fan of event evenings: "You can't do it right for everyone."
And with an event, I only address those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
Dejà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the joy of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival that the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club's restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious interaction in the spirit of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right festivity to perform honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award "Singer of the Year."
"You not only wrote down a lot for us, but also made some rounds for us, but also our heartfelt thank you," says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year's awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity trays went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==
The board addressed a special thank you to the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again enchanted an extra-class menu and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choir rehearsals at 19.45 o'clock on Tuesdays at the club's restaurant.
"New singing voices are always welcome to us," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new poverty reduction targets
The United Nations is starting to work out a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty eradication that were announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals ending in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to embark on a process with which universal, sustainable development goals are to be agreed," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, the top handball player continues to enjoy a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out any trees, Malmon raises the index finger in advance.
I have trained many players myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is also necessary to wait for reinforcements from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Above all in the cover work and in the switching game, it was really bad at last.
The exploitation of opportunities also definitely needs to be improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players finally got their heads clear during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first President of Mozambique, to voice calls for peace during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the city's Independence Square.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by White Rhodesia and later the South African apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to lower concerns about instability.
To AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a "loser" who "will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that Frelimo did not respect the agreement anymore.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and to do so seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a sickening movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use for the export of coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railroad for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga replied reluctantly to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that they should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said that people simply wanted stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again and usable roads," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life," says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools," which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with writers and teachers who were "overly didactic," children would "completely shut down," because in entertaining stories the messages would be "subliminally" conveyed.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof."
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From the arrival to the awarding of the honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his Freihof.
And then the scenery began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the city's big son.
Stilecht drove forward with the two-spanner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was received not only by the audience with much applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected music pieces and thus rounded off the performance.
In order to grant the honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honour of serving the then incumbent Hättich together with a part of the city council.
Their waiting then made the three-kings singers, who prompted Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh, how beautiful, youth memories of my own three-kings come alive again."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud "Heraus, Aus."
At that time, Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the official church just as much as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home soil, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," said the film at the end of the scene play.
There was a lot of applause and many praiseworthy words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants grows
The chances of remaining in the league of Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketballers have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now a competitor for the Neckar giants less.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a possible poster seat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, a first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard procedure, as long as it wasn't clear that Dusseldorf wouldn't get a license," said Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
By 23 May, Ascendant Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic Bundesliga validity.
Until now, however, the licence has been denied to the Rhine countries twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Supper Church in the spotlight
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the cultural and tourism office of the city dedicates the last of its public tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Supper Church.
After the visit to the Atomkeller Museum, Haigerloch was to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The culmination is a visit to the Supper Church.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Milan model.
Meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at the Atomkeller Museum at 3 p.m.
There are maps at the chest of the atomic cellar museum.
The Haigerloch Tourist Office is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spy affair.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snowden threatens the extradition there, it said further
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the winning title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each other.
The game was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were in line with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
During the award ceremony, Carmen Müller finally handed over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze stairs were reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltsriecher team.
At the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful ending of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Open Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach bei Hornberg is once again firmly in children's hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer vacation program, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, for every age the right thing is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11am to 5pm.
The museum workshop also works.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or spinning, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelcart races or stilt races, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the Open Air Museum offers a mystery tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, each at 12 and 14 o'clock.
On a field tour, the children must guess which stories are true or are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be driving his scraper snack with the museum guests from 11 am.
Meanwhile, it is cozy and fairytale with Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
The children's costume dance group from Gutach also performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, numerous craftsmen such as the broombinder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be seen over the shoulder during their traditional work on both days of the event from 11 am to 5 pm.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand town, Burt Muro is regarded as a lovely owl because he has planned to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt can't be distracted from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dump.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the hard coal on the campground in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dumpers and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the transducers move, a shrill warning sound sounds across the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with unfavorable winds, this can be heard widely - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the lawsuits very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it was now necessary to keep the warning signals down with technical measures.
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meter deep recumbent in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here for a long time.
"This year we want to crack the 3-million-ton mark in the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant were to be connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's Basketballers Optimized Despite First Defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern München.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe over the past two years," said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their only third appearance in the European premier class, Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not cleared up enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to transform a 15-point setback 13 minutes before the end into a tour before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful tournaments of the Munich team, which had won clear victories in the first two matches against Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variet artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well known to perform at a club," said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year's event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy benefits event for Army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known through more unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast both on Saturday Night Live and on Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racial-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me, when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years, an agreement had now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last few years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and was also optimistic that both sides would come to a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game squads with machete
Two children confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victims to go hunting birds with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the youngster who had taken her with her was to testify that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the incident before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other things, the elder mentioned a rivalry in the football game as a reason.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth centre.
Pimp must go to prison
Because of exploitative trafficking, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the District Court of Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
So in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who bought some years for him.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he subordinated women's contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored in order to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the mental limitation and thus about a limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court didn't have to hear any of the injured women anymore.
According to a police officer, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking could be identified after an initial notification by telephone surveillance.
The intercepted talks were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, with whom one of the women had spotted bruises all over her body, has not yet made any statement.
It is "a completely broken personality" that sees violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He had disbanded from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after being detained," he said.
Oil price continues to decline to USD 96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil variety for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the late morning in Europe.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of increased demand from two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after reaching its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude oil also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD stop-and-frisk directive
On Thursday, a U.S. Federal Appeals Court blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the case.
The 2nd U.S. Appeals Court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin were suspended until a decision was taken on the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the program for the arrest and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to assist the police in amending its Directive and the relevant training programme.
The Appeals Court heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the code of conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including policy, training and supervision reforms, and ordered a pilot programme of body-mounted cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics were criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the party-free mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a lawsuit that developed into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force and influence the way other police authorities use the regime.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police, but not crime; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that was under pressure after thousands of posts were removed in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reform the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
Of the happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds in reaching only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Hande."
On Saturday afternoon the club's tenth birthday was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He was first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the interventions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and, according to Henne, is now planning to work with the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, the carpentry company Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the Sickbay in Socogim, a slum district on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the Nagold maternity clinic is to be rationed away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a medical doctor, so hen, for example, deaccelerate against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not make as many trips as planned, but for this, many physicians came to Germany to hospitate here in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the musicians from Stammheim, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motives, he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and followed them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one standing in front of people's homes and hoping to catch them freshly, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said, NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors of Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editors when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails from her phone on at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
During the time the research was underway, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous phone calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movement of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett because of an affair with a married woman when he himself was dating the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3rd, 2000 and August 9th, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Rich Tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without result.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have been maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
On Thursday, President François Hollande received representatives of the Elysée Palace in Paris and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75% tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced at the end of November will now also be carried out, said the chief association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are therefore cancelled.
Chinging: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents early in the planning process," Mayor Jens Häussler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to be able to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, says Häussler.
A river basin study was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many cultivated land as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
The planning of protection against a flood that is statistically expected every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service, is completed.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In experts this is called "HQ 100aClimate."
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, approximately four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect to receive national subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Mr Häußler pointed out that support only exists if an overall approach is implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process had to be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the influx of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it needed the interaction of all presented measures in order to achieve the desired goal.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, says Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Unhappiness prevailed in the area of the old town, which, even in normal thunderstorms, repeatedly suffers from congestion of the canal network.
The problem is well known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three-year-old rain events could be tolerated.
Increasing the size of the sewers would devour millions.
Seriously injured after collision
On early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could say little about the accident at first.
However, there were various testimonies that should be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles bumped together, with the woman so severely trapped that the fire department needed almost half an hour to free her from the wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both of the victims came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained fully closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazing is the relationship in the exterior: the stabbing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security delusion and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of John's revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugged his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator of his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "minority report" dates back to 1956 and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime," that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles ours terrifyingly, mutants look to the future - and the police intervene.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the agency.
"We'll grab them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, for that we have a prison camp full of pesudover-breakers." They read time streams.
They assume that bad things happen and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story acts like the blueprint for the NSA's anti-terrorist laws and buzzing.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no separation of powers anymore, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself will be monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system's going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own premises.
Not only does error and sacrifice take up, but it builds on it.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth.
Spyfly around Merkel in Russia testify
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spying affair around Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, reported the agency Interfax.
Previously, Green Bundestag Member Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures reinforce company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, BAT wanted to demonstrate the presence of monitoring antennas and the action led to a change of words between the USA and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not resort to foreign espionage "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit."
But ever since Edward Snowden, the former Whistleblower, began to publish his cornucopia of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director at their word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company's paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow caused the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US was now almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has been no evidence to date that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and that it should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, scope and technical refinement of the U.S. espionage agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of non-US-based members rejected plans to use an American provider after disclosure of US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who didn't exist a year ago - it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this legal space?"
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
It's no surprise that business espionage is taking place.
That's always been the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Management does not usually boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, as this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been bloated that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Member of the Board of Management at Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
German BAT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access," warns BAT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against other countries' economic espionage.
According to Washington Post, in February the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia and Israel behind China in second place among the countries that used to obtain hacking economic data.
A board member of a German Blue Chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has returned.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the clothes, often rugged and embroidered, are closed, often with a veil, while at the back they go down the back and often end up in a train.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes, the ghosts are divorced from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be chosen cream or brown combinations.
The choice of the restaurant is important, it was explained.
Decorative side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to drive the coach, Uwe Link has an offer for that.
"But carriages are also popular for young ladies' farewells," he says.
Romanticism is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
Again, the athletes of dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he scored 87 points in 12th place.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in class 1, looked critically at the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a curled wrestling mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family lawyer explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school gym.
The Sheriff of Lowndes County's investigators came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family questioned it.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never thought he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it is beyond logic to violate both the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
On Thursday, U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important issues were still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of "position-related suffocation."
However, a second autopsy revealed another cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's office was not ready for a comment at our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teen's parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained clues as to how he died.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with children's food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government as the number of school-related children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the most commonly used auto-injection of the EpiPen brand - to respond to a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine in stock more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "sex indefinite"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children born with non-clear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "not specified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgery for sex allocation in newborn babies and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
An intersexual person, according to BBC, said years later: "I am neither man nor woman. "
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
An estimated 2,000 children are born each year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that fall under the diagnosis "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible and that the child's psychological and physical development should not be waited for before, if at all, a decision is made for surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law "sounds after a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children don't," he said.
One could do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexuals are to be distinguished from transsexuals or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but is due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not conform to the gender pattern now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court had granted lifelong retention of an "undefined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German IDs will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, on the grounds that "if the world is dragged into a new state, where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Being a parent is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born both male and female were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god, who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine viewed gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they don't know how the child feels when they grow up with the gender assigned to them.
"In the middle of the 20th century this was called a "psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with undisputed genitalia is based on Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses - such as parenting a child - interacted with a child's genes and hormones and shaped whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it wasn't," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he changed back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations came to the public, who are "not happy with the outcome."
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after his birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was to receive a vaginal sculpture.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born - and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he returned to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made him barren.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexuals to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based Advocates for Informed Choice legal group, is concerned that the German law can "promote stamping and stigmatizing."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a "non-determined" to the child," she said.
We fear that this favours interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Katie is now 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to rush to make decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write "male " or" female. "
In this way, everything is fine - you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy your parents' happiness.
And you don't have to rush an operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents drive because they feel they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better - and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown hurt girl by shot from car
Unknown people injured a twelve-year-old in a car in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children with an air-pressure weapon in Genthin on Thursday night.
That's what the police told us in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Then they drove away.
The detectives are investigating. They said it was Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only summoned twice to throwing eggs at children who threw them against the façades of the house.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains immediately, no material damage was likely to have occurred either.
In addition, some Sylvester Böller were probably fired in the city area, but no damage was done here either.
A local resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his radial blinds were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found his radial blinds in the immediate vicinity all again, so the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a Future Perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastic.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern that in old age the many stairs to the house and in the apartment can no longer cope, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to learn on her own what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently, a book published by her on the subject 'Happy Living in Age - Which form of living is the best for me?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today, in the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people who ever deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them displace it as long as they can.
Only the others get old,' she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think about it.
'Then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 housing models for self-determined living in old age.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision,' she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the old-age resting place in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without any good knowledge of the national language, one can also be solitary in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author says to those who wish to move out of the country.
Their models include classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pensioner's flat.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and blemishes
'For me, such a shared apartment would be nothing,' she means with a wink.
Especially not like in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreats,' says Ries.
Nevertheless, the author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior living community can still work.
This must then be done differently than in the classical Studenten-WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest, she thinks.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, it is not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they can',' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizen service life at the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people on the subject of becoming older.
Therefore, especially older people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions just to stay in their familiar surroundings, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or their apartment, first of all to get thoroughly informed and not to hire the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the apartment you can realize one or the other, and if it is only the increase in the toilet seat, the interior designer clears up.
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the far greater obstacle.
She'll keep searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more afraid than in front of the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to prosecute Snowden further
The U.S. has not changed its attitude to former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of unauthorized disclosure of secret information.
Therefore, he had to face criminal proceedings in the US, said the spokesperson of the U.S. Department of State, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even the recent statements of Snowden would not change that.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA not to threaten him further with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements were that of a parliamentarians and not that of a German member of the government.
Secret Service Huller Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
The former NSA employee, sought by the USA, made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by the Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
After a translation by Ströbele, the text of the letter is as follows:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously employed by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of my government's law, which caused me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent rush that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to be a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society arising from these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while at the same time the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a breach of fidelity and strives to criminalise and prosecute political opinion.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will adopt this harmful stance.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and lawful manner.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten on Gartenstraße was sold by the municipality to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
The budget was EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, how to heat, look for the garden and clear the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a square concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the baton at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first musician's hock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and she reported on Thursday night that the president's top advisors had held "great group meetings and polls at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's dwindling hope of re-election would look better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, Times national political correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of the campaign's and White House's efforts to measure, in particular, the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, the impact it has on the poll scores of the former Secretary of State Clinton for the vice president.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisors - including Daley, former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisors, David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her "close personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible polls back then, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the investigations as "observed care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move paid off in terms of the ballot boxes.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin explained on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious," the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
In the design of the Internet service, was e-mail technically implemented in the same way as in conventional mail?
In the design of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been careful to create a stable foundation for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni," are the two computers connected directly?
In the first step, the Anna e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call his provider.
Are conventional e-mails being read on their way through the web?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading a mail is extremely low.
But theoretically this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
It is also possible to mask the metadata of an e-mail communication with high technical effort, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a August 2013 study by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mailboxes used mainly privately.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had recently fallen, Gmail was able to increase significantly from Google.
Mother buried in the forest and pension collected
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to collect pension and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigation.
First he had covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, then he had covered up the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesperson said on Friday.
According to this, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time it was noticed that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The retiree told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It came out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last taken care of them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy did not reveal any evidence of a capital crime.
Fancy ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first ice cream that shines in the dark - with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining treat from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue during consumption, increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines - the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in itself impossible because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association after six days of play.
This is the time for the team of Ingo Ehlers to start Derby against TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season is starting again for us.
"I hope that we finally have our head free," Ehlers gives himself behaving optimistically.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, is betting on speed.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has left everything but a certain impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win against Nordhorn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's not why we're the favorite, because everything can always happen in the Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series.
Missing is Jan-Malte Jodat.
The A-Jugendliche Joost Windßuss, who is active in the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen with double-playing rights, will make his season debut for this.
If you're not hot in a game like this, you should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more of a Halloween muffle.
For the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I guess I won't do it this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep with Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will represent about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the last scream is the invigorating inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and were not alone with it to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As for candy, we're not pissful.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of candy bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who go through the neighborhood with the saying "sweet or sour."
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let's not fool ourselves - eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectioners.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which by the way is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that earn $500 million in proceeds, said America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos that you're peeing in your pants and then putting your friends on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them again, and then the guy you're standing on leaves a comment like "nice facial expression."
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we have done from a small age.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, says the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers carry charred corpse
The fire department had to move out in Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
The rescue forces are carrying a charred body out of the house.
Rescuers found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday night it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames hit out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor's profession.
The background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently approximately 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.
For today's young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day routine itself.
With Burfien for the first time, the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor on a full job to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after high school.
Burfien refers this to the process of de-churchification: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am in charge of my schedule and I can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as pastors.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
The young people of today, who are not only concerned with career, but with a meaningful job.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belt as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler work mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the rigors and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a puppy who sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky promontory in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miserable position
Firemen roped themselves to the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The fire department managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stuck in a rock wall on a 15-meter-high ledge.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby ran away on Sunday afternoon after a traffic accident and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing bitch and published calls for help on social networks when she escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and roped off to rescue Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, the technical rescue team specialist, said, "She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was frozen stiff.
But now she's fine.
She ate some dog pie afterwards.
That was quite an unusual assignment.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team's specialist, said, "Ruby had a big luck."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he didn't notice anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: " Watching at the rescue was scary. "
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in her arms.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and she had collapsed, she would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never hit Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the alto rocker, and that "he hit me when I was 18."
She added, "That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" landed first this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-protected border along the Hadrianswall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not - as expected - play in the headlines.
No one has mentioned that the EU member states often adjust their strict rules when it is cheaper for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing disregard for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what the Scots really want.
Actually, no story.
And one that has already come in years, that it is already like a fossil: For the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan to unite Europe after the war has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany - founded only this year - was able to win almost five million votes in the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the single currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters - and German politicians would like to leave that way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage freezes do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is coming up, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to raise Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, with which the troubled French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU front national has just won a decisive post-election and thus referred the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European network if we keep our own currency.
Co-operation with other, similarly-thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same thing to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence, only to get a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Getting Adulter Faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age connoisseurs, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the pediatrician association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents - usually that's not a sign that puberty is coming quickly," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hairs and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift at the age of the menarche (the onset of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Counselor for dealing with this frequently occurring problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "agitated" if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before an age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
In case of faster progress, tests by an endikronologist may be indicated so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defense of another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavior problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their contemporaries. "
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter got her days at the age of ten.
Even if there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys come to puberty much like girls used to.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls between the ages of six and nine, which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies supported this conclusion, but there were many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age connoisseurs.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow their facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even among babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a debate about the breadth of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, which indicates the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always those that airlines seek the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus demanded an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American arch rival Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed - in particular whether there are nine or ten seat rows - is crucial for the economic results indicated by the new mini-jumbo design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" can accommodate 406 people in tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often share blows about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed backers a picture of three people squashed together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
In view of changing eating habits, people are getting fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years increased by ten percent, according to data from the US Department of Health.
According to U.S. health statistics, the waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival is following a 1950s seating concept when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out to show that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures on seating dimensions and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do in order to be successful," explains Boeing's cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow clearance, but for manufacturers, it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight for the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently used with ten seats per row.
"This is why Boeing squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
"Eightteen-inch seating width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat posed by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin equipment, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet salesmen even carry tape measures with them in order to recreate the equipment in the competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly compressed design for low cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but according to its own statement has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of increasing the adaptability of the cabins and of offering wide seats at the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to rip off, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-Nicotine vaccine could turn pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Human tests require further tests, which may take several years to complete, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so that a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine retained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, had taken a "time-out," the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if they are quite sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, could prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel any pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to put away their habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
The former Minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the State's oversight of corruption.
The former NSW minister denies having amended the Maritim lease arrangements at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
It is now being investigated for the accusation that Tripodi had known of Obeid's hidden interest in the land after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, had testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer runtimes.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies on Circular Quay, which earned the Obeids $2.5 million annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally advocated public tenders.
However, he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a restructuring of the government's lease arrangements.
One phone stoppage submitted to ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheaty Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter planes attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior government employee to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "reality test"
The government is considering an "reality test" for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former Labor Party MP, Maxine McKew, condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be considered an insult by Australia's neighbors.
"Audible explanations such as "foreigners should get in the back" and "Australia first get in" are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some in the region echoed this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once proposed by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others are still being considered.
If the "reality criterion" is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally associated with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 holders of visas, after hundreds of companies, who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, have finally ceased in the past.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The troubled nine - year - old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed line between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown asked Carmichael to "unmistakably" commit himself to Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic strength also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British Ministers next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian flight passengers still need to switch off tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, watch or play e-books during critical flight phases, if they are in "flight mode."
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when taking off and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a great deal of work, but do not follow any immediate plans to change their rules.
CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"Casa currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft," has been announced.
The subject is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and that passengers comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had talks with CASA about expanding its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, explaining that they are open to change, but that they need to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas stated that one would remain with the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio interference caused by mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, in case of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when taking off and landing.
In front of the Revierderby versus Schalke, BVB supporters with flares had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that offered the viewer up to just before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans with their songs were heard.
The southern grandstand, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans are, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The Capo's pedestal, which otherwise coordinates the common lighting, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the grandstand a big flag with the words "No Stadium Section" blew lonely.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, entered the course as the first BVB player, short-term cheers started.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
Nothing was moving in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Also that Stadion Spokesman Norbert Dichel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a mood for celebration.
Only five minutes before the start, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension, which until then was almost tangible with hands, was excited in a loud scream, when Dicker, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
The last was, as always, the southern grandstand - and finally here again as usual was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud invitation "Derby winner gets up" came with a whistle from the southern grandstand, everything was as usual again.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectators' ranks and onto the square - almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was picked up late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnology.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be cutting," Watzke assured.
One can be curious how the reactions in the South Tribune turn out.
Pawnshops are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in a pawnshop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is increasing - is so high that ValueMax, where it has traded, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore require an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that there is no need to verify the creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans can be made faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawns after families feel the pressure from rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes seek pawns to compensate for the difference in stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, described it as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economic economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have further strengthened the trend towards the pledge of personal items, as people take the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are gold in the 200 pawnshops of the city state.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge Grandmother's gold chain and bring it back next month."
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only provide lower interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers are lending items that they already own and the liquefying of personal valuables does not increase household training," she explains.
The pawnbrokering business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are all people who use pawnshops in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
"These include wealthy people who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence unveiler Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany solve the increasingly explosive NSA spy affair.
According to the presentation of the Green Parliament member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-secretary employee would testify at a German prosecutor's office or in front of an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said to the ARD magazine "Panorama."
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $325 million bailout package for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and gray star treatment, aim to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist medical training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic recording system for health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas I have been told by hospital staff that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public health system on a more sustainable path. "
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the worry list," said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these electives will largely offset recent cuts.
But the health-political spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a "flaster solution."
"We are in today's situation because the Labor state government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the healthcare system," he told ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government is pulling almost half a billion dollars out of the system and putting 300 million in the Commonwealth and then pretending that's good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
The plot, played in France in the 1760s, tells the touching story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never glides into lust or sensational lust - and that's where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tortured penitential shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed important chemical weapons and gitft gas ammunition manufacturing facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group stated on Thursday, while severe clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which Damascus, the Hague-based organisation, had set up to destroy or make "inoperable" all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machinery for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus must, however, begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits here, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which is following the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday but did not mention any details.
The battles underline the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, the visit to two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "abandoned ... and the chemical weapons program's existing objects had been relocated to other designated facilities inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I draw my hat from the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, of which many are members of the Alawites, for a secession of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Wrath over verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002 were angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, as Umar Patek was supposed to be shot by the law.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years with a suspension.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A guilty verdict was also made in a series of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, is also referred to as "Demolition Man."
The decision has brought painful memories to June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for one month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell, Jemaah Islamiah - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To let him live - no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was eventually taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reestablishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has caused other people.
The verdict took place before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but don't have cell phone calls)
From departure to landing, air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not to use mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
At a press conference, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained how quickly they would be implemented depended on the respective airline.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment storage regulations in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to take them back until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the approach, passengers must switch it off again and must not take it off again until the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment also on take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA explained.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we work closely with the airline in this regard - both sides will benefit from it," Glading commented.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to publicly leave a jet from American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the boarding gate.
And heavier devices like laptops still have to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also still forbidden.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA, has the regulatory competence for telephone calls.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board, a safety expert on national traffic issues on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission masts," says Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the switch off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment by passenger-guided FM radios, which at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they don't mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment according to the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio than previous generations.
For example, e-readers only emit minimal radiation when turning around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt that the interference from the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots who spoke for interference of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passengers to switch off the equipment in case of an instrument landing under poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would now be equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued Bird Released by Air Rescue Service from North Sea Drill Island
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released again into nature.
The watercourse was flown to Aberdeen with a helicopter last month, where it was paddled by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: "This watercourse was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea. "
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He couldn't fly anymore, so we were contacted with the request for help. "
When she was released, the watercourse was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK who provide wealth and work want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business executives, representing approximately the British enterprise sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the countries in the EU are stagnating.
They hope that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be favored by the government rather than sticking to the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked for their view on certain legally regulated issues - from antitrust to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market, as, according to companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the advantages of being part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed with what is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "senseful change" that brings the book of action back to Britain.
Much is at stake - an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from renegotiating.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means a greater focus for businesses on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria was the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board of Directors.
"Today's event is a milestone: Construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and his counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk for conventional routes, as can be heard from official sources.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other downstream countries is to begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange Newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in comparison with Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th Real Estate Day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The view on the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial properties are, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period of the previous year.
In the United Kingdom, the increase was only 6%, and in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences related to children before in 2011 charges were brought against child caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, at the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that "the organisation had never dealt with an incident of sexual child abuse."
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, a commission-assistant attorney, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there had been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety'.
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at age 21, admitted that the management failed "from me to go down" in the hiring of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Guidelines.
Lord had been convicted at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year career for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of child safety.
The staff said they were watching violations, including Lord being alone with children, taking care of her privately as a babysitter, letting her sit on his lap, saying to one of them that he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's superior at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable."
The CEO stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their supervisor.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he had informed the board of directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson the organisation had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by employees, and that the board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were made had been made by the managing director of YMCA's child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but this was "overzealous" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organisation when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in hiring, reviewing, training, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister - but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London, saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so...
When the horse show experts found themselves in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirp, who is not even in kindergarten and took his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trotted loosely through the three laps and won the first prize - leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then he has practiced with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field and went away with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had competed with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Totally strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, "The whole audience was electric and everyone cheered on him and clapped on him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about.
As it started, it won't be long before it's on the "Horse of the Year" show - and I'm sure it'll cut off well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer - and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes helped make this a perfect occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after appeal
A Chinese newspaper, which on the front page had demanded the release of a reporter accused of defamation, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on TV that he had accepted bribes to forge reports of a part-state company.
The New Express is now subject to "comprehensive rectification," the regulator explained.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that they had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the New Express rectification and recommended that the relevant controllers be identified at the New Express and immediately reviewed the New Express management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news channel CCTV.
I did it first of all because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a change of law at the beginning of the year, in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel with own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 by 90 centimetre tunnel as one of the most elaborate passages they have ever found.
The zigzag-type tunnel spans almost six football fields, connecting warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and life in a guilty sentence.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation from his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and himself still loved each other, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs from it in a considerable way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan lets off all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may ask, but on closer examination, the vegan food world is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers imitation leather to normal leather.
He realized that other everyday concerns are also possible without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is being an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maxim of the vegans, which extends to the entire consumption behavior.
Instead of grieving for burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "in fact, vegan doesn't represent a renunciation, it's not an asceticism, it's an enrichment." The assumption that food conversion reduces the choice of food options, Proctor rather refers to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditionings caused some even so well-meant attempts to fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor, which makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor puts a comparison.
And say, "Certain tastes are not to be attached to the beast. "
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in another way," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste delicious once.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
He had not suffered any health damage, including eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who exclusively feed on vegan.
"My blood counts are fine, I get checked a lot," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"As animals are nourished with feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," says Proctor.
There is also the possibility for vegans to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor should not go far for food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the ground.
Only once in a while I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is what is known to be the case with "ordinary" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not sometimes better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor was also able to amaze his parents-in-law.
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was also already skeptical.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions, one had to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to enclave.
And in more detail, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan as it was thought - and the vegan doesn't seem to be as limited in everyday life as it is generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
French fries are everywhere!
"Many duner shops offer falafel, or even a vegetarian yufka," Proctor says.
In a pizzeria he deviates on pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
Restaurants are setting up so slowly.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, draw them to their attention."
"If there are enough requests, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, there are vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that also in peanuts animal additives can contain its own as color encoder, one seems to quickly abandon the courage with the observance of ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
"Once in a while one develops a scanner view and knows which signs and logos one has to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stop or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger pointer that hits the consciousness.
Maybe he doesn't quite manage to abandon his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for one hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, it took the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trading in the US came to an end for several hours because of a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
The IPO of Facebook also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of purchase and sale orders, later found the SEC and thundered the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Konstanz: bike ride around 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., was on the left sidewalk from Bahnhofplatz towards Marktstätte.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped from a restaurant on the sidewalk, according to the police, the cyclist could no longer brake in time.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground and pulled a space wound about 15 centimetres long to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British Police Provides Assange with an extradition order
The British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "challenge to face up" to ask him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, he was threatened by the arrest.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden for indictment in a sexual offence, after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court rejected its appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "sent a request to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a chosen time," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy gave no comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be handed over by Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage allegations after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks revelation website.
Driver, who had run between the legs with 210 km/h and hot drink, receives 1,000 £ penalty
A driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 for driving between his legs at up to 210 km/h and a hot drink.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie confessed guilty, without taking the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 and a victim's supplement of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp duty of 7% on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, income from the stamp duty on residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the fiscal year 2012/13, exceeds revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increases in stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of the related legislation against avoidance, it is hard to say that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system."
"However, this step could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate - the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price - in the wealthy London south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog's tail waving and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail waving of their conspecifics, the researchers monitored the animals as these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the dick moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs movies with dogs - either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and thus we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog moving the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly left (again from the dog's perspective, which waves), her heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and if you have the wedding with your tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and visiting scholar at the University of Bristol's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said that this was not the first study to investigate whether dogs were important to both the left and right.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was said: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when his "tail" is wagging left and not right instead of becoming restless - just the opposite from the Italian study."
According to him, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can be easily recorded, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to the illness of Alex Turner
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer is ill with larynx inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play at Hydro on Friday.

The band's announcement came after she had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys will also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with larynx inflammation, which is why he cannot appear."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th, which was moved to the 21st of November at the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
On 22 February, Pope Francis was to appoint new Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope's election - this is the case for a group of 120 cardinals entitled to vote.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting would take place for all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, would be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary for the number of cardinals entitled to vote to be 120 again, and as many cardinals as he wants to be over 80.
The Consistory next year was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, said Valero.
At present there is a certain overhang on the side of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "well possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - this is all completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called to cardinals, but Francis would be "full of surprises - so we don't know who he appoints."
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatrest
General Motors called back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks built in 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a news release from the US Vehicle Safety Regulatory Office on Friday.
For some of the wagons, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal guidelines on vehicle safety for head restraints.
"When driving from the rear onto the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The returned models were produced between August 1st and September 10th.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
An Obama voters' cry of desperation
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book right now.
It's a book I thought it would cheer me up during the sad second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient records at night and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and could take my breath away from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and newsmen stopped to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had approval scores of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you were torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the party-political blockade tactics have overturned too many attempts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have come to an end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads of state or to kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished to expose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are being evaded during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report saying that the White House's efforts to put the media at rest are "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government."
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether or not I should have understood when I was 18 that the government's work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the parliamentarians' office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard for so long.
But with the decline of Obama's approval levels to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to take a serious loss to Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral helpers after the decision, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe out questions as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes are being cut or cut.
However, Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she is receiving leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes in advance after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it could be done more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you walk in, enter the data into a computer, select immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballots.
Is it used because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Today, matching with pencils is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously."
A public office was about public service.
"We are striving for no reward but that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two of whom are familiar with the situation, and this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation of the alleged manipulations of the currency market is rapidly picking up pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 billion is traded daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that follows the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, persons close to the situation indicated that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been released from his current position as European head of Forex Spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher's Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, who said they were close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar people.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has stirred traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks "may influence the market even with very low ticket prices."
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she had quit a dealer in her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the fence on the Bechtle property
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the disintegrating house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the terrain is threatening to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed on the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI a banner with the message "We are for it" had been installed.
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins."
Thus she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins in the Swiss meadow - if one day the giant project fails.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site," it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they're starting to resign because the city is delaying these answers further, says the BI.
It was heard that the mayor's public statements also had an effect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he said that he was afraid of leaving for the thermal bath if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow.
Some seem frightened because of this, others see it as a "plump blackmail attempt" on the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane kein Schwalbenkönig
As satisfied Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he took the two offensive swirls in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became an alleged actor's fate - which, of course, was not one, as the TV pictures showed.
"A gross misdecision," said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He definitely defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who got insulted," stressed the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success race, Rangnick agreed to an anthem of praise.
"There are only two words for this: Really good," he said.
There's not much to complain about.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep this going.
There will be hardly any squad changes during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change.
"Apart from a player who wants to leave the club," Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - forcing American citizens to take out health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 - is constitutional within the framework of the state's tax authority.
The supreme judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also considered that the requirement of the Health Act that states either have to extend the access requirements for Medicaid or that all state funding for Medicaid would otherwise be cancelled was not unconstitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Due to the low sunfall, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" mayor Steinar Bergsland raved at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley arranged for sunchairs, while others put sunglasses on for safety purposes.
So far, sun-hungry people have had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the beams into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615,000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian Alpine village of Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Post barely clears on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still at different letter boxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether Sunday will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten, will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's question.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Rohrenbeck, wants to check here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially when it comes to appointment mail.
"Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, this undertaking is radically and unreasonably thinning out."
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberals' political group and city council, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here, secretly, the hours of emptying are changed or also deleted."
The post office is miles away from the city.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhenbeck unisono.
Even for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens, a mailbox with Sunday emptying should also be able to reach within walking distance.
In the city parliament, Rohrenbeck asked if the city administration was planning talks with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the mail did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But to his knowledge there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has been in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt's Parking Fees Should Increase Strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city's magistrate advises this morning on a draft of traffic officer Stefan Majer (Greens).
According to this, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be increased, but the time interval between parking meters and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce's Retail Committee considers this "not a good idea."
The parking possibility immediately before the shop is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller specialist dealers."
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "very appropriate and actually long overdue."
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Rapid Actions Surprise Hosts
With a narrow squad, the TSV Freudenstadt gentlemen I had to compete against the TG Gönningen von der Schwäbischen Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen.
The Elbler were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
However, it soon became apparent that they could not keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadter, also due to age.
With the hard and placed bumps, the Gönninger made themselves extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the middle of the net and were not present in the block defense.
Two high first sentence wins clearly expressed the superiority of Freudenstadter in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and game-defining performance, the third movement was won a bit lax and without pleasure to the 3-0 final score (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to win in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will stand in the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points, especially in the acceptance of the ball; also in the case of the passes, the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical game scenes, the overeer prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this very well-balanced meeting, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
A group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach for the fifth day of maintenance following the Natura 2000 project of upper Hotzenwald.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley in the area of the hut was to be cut open that day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Emperor, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the Gorgesteig, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the Care Day was a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council, following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the Weitblick coincides with the goal of maintaining the now heavily grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types through opening and connection to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to maintain the species.
Tribukait said she wouldn't miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
In this planning, the current measure is not only integrated seamlessly.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements achieved with the Life project as well as the previous maintenance days for the future.
Following these various statements, District Leader Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest tug was possibly ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the clear view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior citizens' policy, as well as its own municipal works can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet reported.
The 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been the only candidate to succeed Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for old age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11th, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, put an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was outbid by Nortel at the bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents deal with technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit that hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After being outdone by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed with its attempt to acquire the lawsuit patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the lawsuit.
Rockstar claims a high level of compensation from Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt swears first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, who have their seat on the Nile and are modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who, since its foundation 84 years ago, had mostly been targeted by the respective government as a forbidden organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential splendour of the Mubarak period, traffic was stopped only for a short time, so that the convoy could cross the usual busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the goal.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, explained to the judges in the wood paneled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army band who played the national anthem, to which he listened in a posture.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university's largest lecture hall with choruses of "The army and the people are one hand."
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to recover presidential powers that the military council had assumed from the head of state who had been driven out of office.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not before the parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party," on Saturday evening we continue with a SC 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers fell from ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder while changing a defective external sensor and injured himself severely.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to change a defective heating sensor on the outside façade of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder leaning on the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Landeskrankenhaus Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6."
Rapists in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice a life sentence on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim had later died as a result of serious injuries.
John Cana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused horror nationwide.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for 14 hours for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the youth was so horrible that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
During the trial, Kana had admitted to having been in a bar with booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed that he had beaten and raped her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police initially assumed that several of the perpetrators were involved, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
During the trial, the prosecution also stressed that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa: there are about 64,000 sexual violence lawsuits every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
But police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark rate of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pig's cubs, turbomast is not a good requirement.
Can ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and gown he gets inside the factory.
Jumbo, too, has to disinfect his hands before he can grab the microphone.
Jumbo spotted to strengthen fast food in Waldshut
"This is where I get worked on huge quantities," the TV makers marvel, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with a level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what will happen," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that disassembling the clubs is still handmade.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo visually of a "sub-boat."
The trick: fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," says the TV star.
This will enable all involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The tour operator now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes of between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its earlier forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track towards record annual revenues before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest winners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which offset a slightly weaker business travel market.
It went similarly well for Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK, while business customers also spent less here.
The US business recovered compared to the weaker first half of the year due to seasonal factors, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics - the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Examinations, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSE would become "challenging, ambitious and stricter."
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours per year.
While there will be no formal requirement for more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalitions say that the comprehensive math exam, combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings, will probably encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from the right life," including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes will be presented by the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The reviews have already been made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 hosts this large exhibition.
Breeders of the associations existing in the district Soest show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges took the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
The visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition is held by Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The Rabbit Show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola with stately prizes and a delicious cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next ecumenical discussion forum on Monday, October 21, at the Neues Museum des Schlosses is about the topic "To hell with hell - theological considerations on today's handling of the last things."
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, the palace of Salem and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance.
In the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to investigate the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
Had people known too much of this in the past centuries, and had put their trust in those images of heaven and hell that still shape our imaginations today, the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of perfection is rather characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks. "
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death."
This is connected with the question of the longing "that dreams that in the end everything will be good."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 from Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics of the Little Heuberg affirm their creed at the confirmation
In two divine services 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the church service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firmsacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firmlings had prepared themselves for the great feast day in the past months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of the Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the circuit over the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee informs.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 altitude meters, also numerous jedermannsradler, who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two top-class junior drivers from Germany were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good rankings at the German Championships.
These two could set off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again able to place in second place.
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen came in second and third place.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years with the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute topathletes at the start.
Four riders were able to move away from the top regional riders.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Together with a teammate, Pangerl was already world champion twice in twelve-hour driving.
This year he was European Champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championship titles in the duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was an eyelash finish in the finish in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Only one second behind it the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall classification.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as third of the overall classification.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race in the women's championship.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him to be the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness over and over again and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze themselves in minibuses and ride the tied-up medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help.
Everything doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his wide smile and boundless energy - likes to attend the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per ride," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, city hall or apartment; after the surgery, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's an exhausting process, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference for the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of a hernia that he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteering for Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in surgery where we can help spot blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
Once they are in Yaoundé, however, Bwelle takes care of accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonese people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is no burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling a promise that he has made to his Father, brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea," is cut on Horst Janson's body.
Janson is himself an old bunny in his profession of acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago while fishing.
So the two just complement each other great.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the old man's neck, which the fisherman boy Manolo is talking about.
When Santiago sits on the chair tired of life bent, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is thoroughly a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish by his knowledge and strength of will.
Janson is on stage as a single actor in long distances.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he sheds light on the active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings Cuba's way of life with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewer from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne at a length of about 120 metres.
If you visit Cologne, don't pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting place for his tours is the Cologne-Tourism Service Center directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city's fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and that's why the remains of the old city wall only stopped what wasn't too big.
Most users of the car park therefore rush past the Roman remains today and only turn off their car.
But if you look more closely, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal bars in Parkdeck D2.
About five meters high ruins of hand plate-sized stones can be seen.
"They are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants climb back down into the depths.
We are witnessing the headquarters of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium," which in good German means "the city of Roman law and the city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult"."
And the Praetorium is the former Governor's Palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance to the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here on a length of about 120 meters.
"You can walk quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests up.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After fetching the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe River, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is due to begin shortly.
However, some years will pass before completion.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu will be rolled up after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Frankfurt Regional Court (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent about the opening.
They are said to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One was said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, it was preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about turf fights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
At that time, a court spokesman said that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof annulled the judgment after revision of the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the Landgericht for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody for another offense.
The opening was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes on the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the then investigating commissioner was summoned.
In the center were cell phone conversations of the defendants and other persons who had been intercepted by the police.
Difficult is that Rocker in court almost always adheres to a law of bronze for her - and does not testify.
The same goes for the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Attorney-at-law Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said, on demand, that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
11 further days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but eventually it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the front and rear seats the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or another cocktail or champagne may be responsible for that!
What's closer than going to the next drive-in to get a little something?
I admit, I like to be there when it goes to fast food-holing late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a Coke, a Burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers are noticeable.
Because what is missing is that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially at the weekends are discarded paper bags on roadsides and on parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It's not just that the paper stuff is changing the landscape.
Bags have already concealed transport facilities such as guardrails and caused accidents.
But she doesn't even know what that word actually means.
When you travel more often in the evenings, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after plucked nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
There would be a few bags more or less nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to tramp around on the rest of the food.
I see already the day, on which the way away becomes too stupid for the cities and municipalities - and the fast food chains for their bags must demand pledge.
Obama's Retirement in Health Policy
After strong criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday on his frequently repeated, unambiguous promise: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After having received a letter of termination from their insurer, hundreds of thousands of Republicans accused the president of deceived the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama put his original promise into perspective.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"You're getting a better offer," he said.
The government described it as little surprise that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look at a different tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing in front of the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to a consultant behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with Republican Congressman Billy Long from Missouri. It was a question of whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged on the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced state-funded insurance in order to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wanted to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighter planes attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia the day before.
According to CNN, the goal was "rockets and related equipment," which the Israeli government feared were intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired from Wednesday to Thursday on the night of the shooting and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, showing Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles that Channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometers and can transport warheads up to 70 kilos.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an Israeli government official who is also anonymous, saying that he believes Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
At any rate, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We are not commenting on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, declares that US espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the U.S.'s defensive stance with regard to its surveillance programs, saying that espionage had gone too far in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA's espionage activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has come into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
During a video-connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "Without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that have virtually expired by autopilot simply because the ability existed to do so, which is due to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 11 September."
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far. "
The President is determined to clarify and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this trial will not be affected.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a power of the good and that many lives were saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. "
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happened?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings, and the murder of people because we have learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on anti-terrorist efforts, as stated by the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first Democrat to sit in the Senate and chair the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some U.S. allies, although this week the head of the secret service said that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
James Clapper, head of the National Intelligence Service, defended allies' espionage as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the Congress's journey to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While stressing that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, Murphy also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that European governments had to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on his way to the Middle East and Poland on a weekend trip to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away match of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is planning an operation by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he was only able to do so individually.
"We will decide on his assignment at short notice," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six goals.
The Mainzer must already renounce the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian Appeals against Prison Penalty in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after stating to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
She was in local police custody until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a low-security detention centre on the edge of Phuket, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubby League, who turned to the Canberra State Department to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford filed an appeal against the judgment and is on a bail of 50,000 baht at large.
In Australian reports, she is now on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
On the part of the court it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand might be trying to improve its damaged tourist image, and therefore there is an acquittal.
