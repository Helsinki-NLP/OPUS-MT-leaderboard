A Republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by affirming that electoral fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republicans' lawyers, by the way, have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make the registration or gang procedure more difficult.
This phenomenon became more important after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods of early voting, declare the right to register as voters on election day invalid, and deny citizens the right to vote for whom a court act is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state asked voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law.
The Republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority in their country.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to get the necessary ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the necessary photo identification.
This is far more than that.
Students who are seen as voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state requested proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, republican legislators have promoted laws in eight states in 2011 which abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign to register voters in the general elections in 2004 helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the number of new voters' registrations by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they represent only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, represented only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the states that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral committee to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to electoral legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Prostate cancer screening: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes showed faulty results, with false negative or false positive results leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to more hesitation of the already indecisive men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the USA, there were many disturbances between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there was a difference in mortality in patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that if there is no early detection, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher after 12 years of follow-up.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who had already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by identifying the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases it is more likely to be actively monitored.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and offered treatment in the event of disease progression.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be determined.
That's why I still recommend carrying out the test.
Most important, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PPE test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting ill with it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this would increase to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is expected that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unsolved.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely damages people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesperson André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the cigarette is abandoned, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, grim intestine, rectum, esophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer," he adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of developing Grimm- or fattening intestinal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family exposure.
"The carrying out of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a certain stir last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that this is really the Higgs.
Without the shadow of a doubt, we know that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be completely certain about it.
Nevertheless, let us assume that this is actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let's look at what it is about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that causes two objects not to be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and don't try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them as well: the Pauli principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state," whereby this "state" consists largely of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and obey the Pauli principle like.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil gang of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing, by the way): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "particles of force" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle" which is the "bote" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at exactly this place, like a pebbles thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disturbed" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could only be furrowed by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep it in the refrigerator by itself.
And not all particles interact equally with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (as the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What can all these researches be "good" for now, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to check the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to investigate all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who desperately hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great defects, since it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (erneut ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found in CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no one.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was more regarded as a "lab gaming" at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has won it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can really never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... Le Devoir
With her Committee on Die in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that raised him had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resigns and agrees to get help with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, since it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"This depends on the ability of the person" to take a step backwards, he notes.
In the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients who are admitted to the Home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, doctors and nurses taking care of them no longer overcrowd them with so-called "healing " care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated. "
But because of the illness, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no desires in life anymore," she says, before accepting that they put on a mask to help her breathe.
She still expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy, in the next few days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois one offers with a group of volunteers body care and help with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little considering that one day we're all going to die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with Brandy or Pepsi, as desired.
The diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports nurse Nathalie Savard.
Victor-Gadbois home isn't a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows, while in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel, worried.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great deficiency in Quebec's health care ensures that several doctors specialised in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent figures in palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's healthcare system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain, without taking any measures to relieve her.
I'm afraid that the only reason patients want to die is because they don't get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions until the last day.
The chances of Hélène Richard's survival were already minimal when she stopped chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the nurses for not accepting this request after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care for the Montreal area's home palliative care society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in either sporadically or permanently sleeping the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be eased."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, construction companies, fund managers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell us every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are involved.
An "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system disintegrates since drastic measures have been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police Department.
The scandal was revealed by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of the embezzlements in connection with the contracts for road works in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchesneau Report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he emphasized, "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved one billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them were beating their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit is also making great efforts with its troops to provide auditors, investigators and analysts to the government.
In addition, the police of the Marteau Force, which since 2009 has caused Montreal's "channeling cartel" to take a more cautious approach to the artificial bloating of the treaties...
Over the past few weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were specifically charged.
The latter has attracted attention by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For several years he himself has paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game everywhere, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he had organised illegal funding for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts the costs of which have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewer contracts, the costs of which he artificially blew up.
Other officials from the Road Construction Office have admitted that they were allowed to be lubricated by artificially bloating the invoices with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organiser of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his pockets with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal to raise the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property for $5 million and was resold to developers in the booming real estate market for 1.6 million.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation that is ultimately being carried out, she says that she is "on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the system infiltrated by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigative unit, as well as supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, for his part, that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all, they are concerned about the role of "mandaters who are aware of tactics" when they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on 70% of black money in the funding of the Quebec election campaigns, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak rejection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "Until campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and Montreal's, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my playing level every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I'm not excited.
Since my beginnings at the center of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed step by step.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals of this summer are used to performing games of very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to stand up and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect for all technicians.
In Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Back then, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the top rider.
We're lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we have qualified for the eighth round.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the back match of the eight-finals as a home match.
Can the PSG become a big European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides itself with the means for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really care about this title.
We were close last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We've finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, Montpellier's, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are struggling for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media are expecting too much from the PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win in a home match against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can blame us for, it's certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn't been able to qualify for the eighth round since two seasons, and which has also made huge editions!
With regard to the sums invested, you were believed to have 15 points advantage during the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's all the better to speak of a "Zlatan dependency."
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he pointed out that he was a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their playing levels.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some playing time.
I have seen things there that have strengthened me.
Today I manage to make good matches in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus."
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must demonstrate exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and stimulates victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does the draw forced on 16 October in Spain constitute a kick-off game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, shaped by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's price fell five months later to 2 dollars, before recovering to around ten dollars today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to traditional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, every time the trade is controlled and handled by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all net nodes are simultaneously custodians of the invoicing book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts' billbook spread throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, whereby the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked."
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number has been found, the other nodes can effortlessly check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without any link, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites providing services to Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, who is a company to pay with real money and who uses the network Bitcoin, assures that "the vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol."
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to donate of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billing book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are out of circulation.
A "mega-final sale" was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are thereby cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are rethought in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB's report, by the way, provides for the re-evaluation of the various risks now considered to be high in the event of this currency's success.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek and Tajik have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees financed by French loans, was done properly.
The convoys of trucks and tanks overflown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban influxes in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war due to the struggles of the various rebellious groups.
Their seizure of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They have discredited themselves, and most of them have not been involved in the fighting themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that doesn't consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who have been able to make use of American funds: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
Jobs will have to be provided to these young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralisation on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which has existed since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Mining is not possible without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site or without means of transport for an export over the mountains.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, have the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavated on the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's main employers.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Girls and boys' gymnasiums, Institute for French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which a large number of local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often at a height of more than 2000 metres.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests from small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their wish, the continuation of lower, well-controlled and directly related civilian aid would be necessary in their favour.
A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power of attorney, it has decided to put everything on one card.
To the surprise of everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this assembly two additional months for the completion of its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and" trample on justice. "
It is assured by its supporters that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text section by section.
It is also a way for the President to regain his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages throughout the country.
Following confirmation in an interview with the American weekly magazine Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
When an ultimatum is placed on the Egyptian people with this retraction of a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited authority," the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of this constituent assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not responded to the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt that they were unable to demonstrate their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
Yesterday morning 11 people, alternate members, were added in a hurry to achieve the quorum.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, since some members of the panel thought that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which drew all attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules," which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who regard this only as propaganda, respond to "shyness."
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have an eye on Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university is far less moderate than the present one.
"Currently, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that "there may be ambiguity in relation to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, ed.]
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wishes, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The facts of blasphemy are being maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on TV last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea from Sole
The Promised Land unites the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unspoilt nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Bend before the sacred places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the closure of the sea storm and fishing.
Right here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Here believers make the path of suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where there is the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the mourning wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with desires that then come true.
Take a Journey in the Heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins of their own power.
All the others bring an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude there is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to one ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on only one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean Desert are kept, as well as approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bath servants of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most moving section is the monument to the children who were built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
There is total darkness when entering the room.
Stars are sparkling.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died resound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three most important recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salinity and thus even non-swimmers carry easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and medicinal mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of stressed nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Ancientity
The old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast, holds these secrets.
Through this city was the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow alleys named after zodiac signs.
According to the legend, Fortuna is supposed to be the hold of all those who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo events.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Bookmarks for tourists
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is better not taken in Euros, but in Dollars, which can easily be changed into Shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the suburb to the upper city.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the mode of transport, including transfer for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is suspended.
And on Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you can choose between different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-fed cats that stray through the streets comfortably and uninvited.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the rooftops of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars a day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in their homeland.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to pass a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this regime applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail trade.
However, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
Not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation have to be carried out.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both receipt and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions only apply to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law also excludes persons who received their certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, Problem and Protection of Rights
The whole of the examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law came into force in the press: What does it actually bring?
What are the changes in the rule of language skills for both the Russians and the guest workers?
In particular, spokespersons from the Migration Authority said that the aim was to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment encounter problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who will put him in a dark, narrow barracks under the pretext of help, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland you are promised the One, and on arrival you will be deceived, their passports will be taken away and will not receive the promised salary," confirms Tolib Schwaripov, head of the head of the labour migration department of the Tajik Migration Agency.
Don't scold me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they are not only unable to speak the language of the destination country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to stay illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "no access to unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajike Umed Hushkadamov comments to journalists.
"Just don't shy away from the costs of fake papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners didn't get it for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that certificates cannot be bought simply, is agreed by both officials and civil rights activists.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will have time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the weapons law for private arms owners.
The authorities are thus responding to recent events: wounded in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the amok run of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the use of non-dead weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Weapons Act would shortly be submitted to the Duma.
Not all of them are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "attacking the screws."
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - demand that the authorities refrain from "sensual tightening up."
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed over six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening up the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, in Moscow you can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, told a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a web page that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, there are illegal weapons stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police's armory and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
Explosions often occurred in many military camps.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military officer.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore throw the weapons under the hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes handicraft production and a mafia that organizes smuggling," explains the former military personnel.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminal literature and publicly accessible data on weapons portals.
According to investigators, the vast majority of illegal weapons come from the army and legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there by "the debt of those responsible for their work with weapons, " says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% from thefts in weapons production, and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant from a gun shop that does not want to be named assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been out of date and no one buys them.
According to him, it's more common for traders to get supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, such as a TT gun, is purchased via an ensign.
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police know everything, of course, and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, they periodically buy controls from dealers who offer illegal weapons," adds the sales advisor.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find one another through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone came to my attention and suggested coming to the station "Begovaia" where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only learned there
Military Commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and arrange for a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets you tell him that the daughter has lost a tooth."
At the moment, I even get a few rings about a friend I trust.

Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemas have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
"I felt like I was in the luxury store," recalls the military.
According to Baranets, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
I, as a potential customer, do not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons are offered "for different purposes."
No papers are needed, no personal meetings are required.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a fight gun or a gun."
Users place their orders there and make inquiries.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Ivan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently switched off countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are coming to the service.
People come like hungry fish while feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible persons accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through an ATM.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitriy Kislov.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can end up empty and come behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched off countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are coming to the service.
"People come like hungry fish while feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
One Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms is expected to result in prices ranging from USD 100 to USD 900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps by mid-range guards.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion detected related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the USA, fast food and supermarket workers are on strike
One in four American teenagers sits behind Mc Donald's box office at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests against low wages across the U.S. in Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon run out of air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of founding trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the USA, attracting millions of customers, sometimes resulting in hand-to-hand crowds.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom 2.2 million are worldwide, laid down their jobs and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, struck chain branches whose target group is people with low and middle incomes.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart stores is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from Berkeley University of California prove that if the company raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they do now for wages.
If Walmart would turn the wage increases completely on the customers, every purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
That would be $12.39 a year for them compared to today's extra spending.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that protests took place only in nine states and that they did not give the company any losses.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in his shop from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
All in all, the Walmart cashiers carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
In an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website, the company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed that "less than five" Walmart employees were doing the job and that the protest campaign was merely "another PR trick" of the union that organised the protests.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart stores (which are not desired in this progressive city and therefore so far inexistent), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you won't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
At present, according to federal and New York legislation, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get 8.90 US dollars an hour.
No one earns less than her in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get along with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were behind the bar after school at McDonald's, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there for longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly encounter people complaining that they have to get along with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal's forum that writers say it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law forbids corporate management to stand in the way of this goal and to admonish or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance doesn't make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a midday meeting in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet they don't grant you sick days, and you won't get paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food staff so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were there, not all of whom are employed by far in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands of people work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain is only moderately outwitted"
The theme of extended reality, popular with modern technology fans, is usually perceived recently by the lens of a special pair of glasses.
At first Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the Interactive 3D Technology Group at the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a passing station for the company's scientists.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output is not yet decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform all those around about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and scarce gestures instead of exploding gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How?
For example, would you ask me to give you this bubble can?
They say it and point it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can't afford at the time?
Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work above all on the development of new sensor types, which will enable us to better understand people's reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps wouldn't be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
Not only the resolution along the X- and Y-, but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and frankly said, the current 30 fps are too little especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I needed just such a device, without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system, in which we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of extended reality in everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand while on the go, but I think the most amazing option would be a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch from glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and that's their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the enlarged reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She's taking great pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something firm, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point, where the finger is, creates a feeling that is currently as weak as someone coughed over the handballs.
There are also braces for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to outwit the brain?
Make it think it feels what it should feel when it's seeing something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (others than in gyms), mobile platforms and large spheres.
So far, the brain is only moderately outwitted, and there are many years of work ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde," which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city, and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, landed on the exquisite list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bearded man, who is sometimes found at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller's paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s and early 90s respectively.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, conjures up a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and gives them a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a rotary organ and became a Petersburg rotary organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's existence, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in town, for example?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevina"; from this came "Pushkinskaya 10," and then there was the end.
I'm attracted to the theater, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all this was united in your Art Clinic... it was important to me to be at the heart of St. Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the House of St. Petersburg Bohemians until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga."
He and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and also included today's hip composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In the year 2000 there was a poll in the press about the award "Personalities of our City."
I won in the category "Artists of the Year," and with that I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's world, it's easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition entitled "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be that way.
In a clown, it all blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by requiring that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves on the exterior and not on the inside of the human being.
But maybe you shouldn't give a man his hand, but spit in his face.
The deception disappears through the dress-up.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban organist.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-communitys, and it's difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to figure out who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But there are several thousand to the performances of Stas Mikhailov!
- To him come abandoned women, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such paintings, which even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov at a collector.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It says: mental culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It's said: Servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some who might be experts, but they are being blocked, because it is necessary for higher-ranking experts to properly assess the former and clear the way for them.
Now only one's own taste counts.
The same goes for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can only grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, it's much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the City of St Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth's inhabitants on board are on the lookout for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question is how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I don't think there are many choices.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the research associate of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible in great heights or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The researchers first dealt with the issue of reproduction in space with regard to flora.
Experiments with plants were already carried out half a century before.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to investigate the effect of weightlessness on embryo development.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a stop; it has to be able to stand on his legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without solid ground, the chicks hit wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely stumbled.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then set up the whole thing because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev on the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion."
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special has been found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research must be continued," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Is it getting out of space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Still, there's a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Valeri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must seek new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravitation.
The hydrolab at the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Although adults feel water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel water is a natural element.
It's as if the little Ichtyanders are witnessing that life on land has descended from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the amniotic fluid in the mother's belly for about 9 months, and that it can then get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks pass from birth to the first swimming.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
Thus, while weightlessness is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decline enormously quickly and thus also the ability to squeeze out the child decreases.
All right, let's get around this with birth-leading aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to force the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's attraction, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit like an adult in orbit for training.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," predicts Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
Eventually, however, it becomes reality when the Earth's inhabitants set out in their spaceships to a distant planet that becomes the home for their descendants born in space.
NKÚ boss: Black system control fails due to political fault
In connection with public contracts, the Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and adequate laws, but falls behind in their application.
Speaking for Aktuálně.cz, Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ).
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, hinders its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project comparing the laws of both countries on public contracts.
What was that about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question of the European legislation defining how public contracts should be managed, and that is what national legislation is based on, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have all compared this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have found extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more "stricter and perfect," but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What is the result of this project?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and reduce and adjust thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Efficiency means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But reducing thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork," and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is similar to ours and also has a college, which is only formed slightly differently. Basically, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are also these courts of account in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
This is certainly not, but as I said: I do not like such comparisons very much.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us are also facing problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have had any cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what importance did the amendment of the procurement law have for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
Considering that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it does not yet have an effect on our trials.
Since our controls are carried out subsequently, there is a certain delay to be expected here.
To date, we are more likely to have an impact in the preparation phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognizing risks of inefficiency" and are examining and analysing almost 14,000 public contracts with it - where the changes will naturally have an impact, as the thresholds are changing, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you think the adoption of this law is rather positive, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be respected.
Under the previous rules, the persons under examination are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Procurement Act is equivalent to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system puts even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let's say which path is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now forbidden or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the supervisory office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we're pretending to be nothing.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely on the basis of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the streets there are isolated ice smoothings, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are mostly easy to navigate, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary the roads were well navigable this morning, occasionally snow and ice smoothing prevailed.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it does not snow anymore, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
On the combs of the Ore Mountains, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was restricted visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class road routes in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes icy and smooth.
All traffic routes of the second and third classes, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, snow remains partially icy or drained.
Increased attention is therefore needed, especially in the higher positions.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some streets of East Bohemia there is danger of ice smoothing, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes still an extended snow layer on the roads, the road and motorway Directorate informs on their internet pages.
The majority of the roads warn drivers against ice smoothing, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smoothing can occur in particular on second and third-class roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies in particular on the roads in the Krkonoše Mountains and in the Orlické hory Mountains.
An extended snow layer is located in altitudes on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely without precipitation.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now easy to navigate, but local attention is required, and the driving method is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, ice smoothing can occur on the streets.
Nebula is also expected locally, but visibility will improve during the day.
These data are derived from the district road estates.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended by the majority of roads between the 80th and 131st kilometres.
The roads of the first street class are mainly dry, but frozen through.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smoothness can occur in sections.
The lanes of the second and third road classes are wet, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
Olomouc District
Today, snow mud must be reckoned with by drivers who are heading towards the altitudes in the district of Olomouc.
After the use of scattered vehicles, Snow mud remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snowdriving forced the roads to use, in the district of Šumperk about 3 cm of new snow fell according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully navigable.
"In the Šumperk district, snow remains remain in the altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, the riders must expect snow mud in the direction of Jeseník," said a staff member of the Šumperk Road Administration today to the ČTK Agency.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to leave at night, according to their information, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are fully navigable, but in the district of Šternberk the riders have to drive carefully in forest sections, because here the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, the roads are reporting several poorly navigable sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí County is closed according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even in lower locations, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads. On the other hand, there are no problems reported from the low plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are generally dry there.
So far, no traffic disruptions have been reported.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions during the night - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I/13 on the border of the Ústí and Liberec districts.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches pressed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people like to start at.
With our band The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's end.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It's a nationwide benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is expected to end on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
Who made this idea?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we not only want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we are once handing this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded together with other performers the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "World Doom Falls Off."
The anthem on YouTube is already very popular today. Will it also be heard at the charity concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and that the end of the world doesn't happen...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live together in a direct connection from Czech television.
The hymn's lyrics are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you get to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It turned out that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have already been working on for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built in which we will then move in with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What criteria did you choose them for?
We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. We also have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By travelling abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible for disabled people. It is still unusual there when someone is alone in a wheelchair in the city centre.
It is not even self-evident that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're gonna hang out with...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in getting involved with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, as our presenter, Láďa Angelovič, says, something has gotten out of control (laughs).
But didn't the band become known until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers helped us; we also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you can't see it to the outside, your performance doesn't exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you can handle things differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, compassion; that's only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full-fledged life, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only for them but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as one hears from many people?
If one wants to do something well, one must not compromise on many things and must also demand some discipline.
However, I believe that this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and when they find out that they have twice a week rehearsals, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm with many quickly disappears.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that really wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected to each other by live circuit and the band The Tap Tap's hymn "World Doomsday Falls Off" sounds a joint interpretation.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of a multifunctional handicapped education centre under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this space agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency ESA. Poland is thus the second member of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's way into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, although they did not always get an understanding of it.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Eingang zur Kosmonautik."
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Eingang zur Kosmonautik."
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the earthward side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railroad draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for starting or braking the draisine.
The information on this matter comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents that have been handed down that research has progressed to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 the technical press published the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohoziński, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukovy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, its work ended from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society was made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space company.
At that time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was foreseeable that exploration of space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Federation of Space, which was founded in 1951, and indeed the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-Chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flying height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests began in the Błędów Desert with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of vertical winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was discontinued.
The first RM rocket was built in 1962 and was replaced by the Meteor 1 rocket.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed of this rocket (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) which differed in size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport room with 0.4 liters capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the aviation institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 is also worth mentioning, followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Republic Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on charitable work.
This decision gave rise to a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculations.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages), price tensions occur.
This term refers to a situation in which the producer attempts to compete economically by importing cheap goods by "submitting" competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, for most companies, this means moving their production abroad or buying it cheaply, or abandoning their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparable labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending is necessarily increasing.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the gentlemen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the overall social and economic damage they cause.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is particularly reflected in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force one's own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the pay field.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
For several years now, there have been public food dispensaries in Germany for poor people who are no longer in a position to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase its income to the minimum subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly result in the same situation in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under pressure from a catastrophic fall in their social level, or to stand up for a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
Here, naturally, the question arises as to where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty emigrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa at all, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim, up to the point of overindulgence, that the state must not participate in its own economy with capital, and that planning economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists narrowly on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy by directing it.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual preference, legislation in which virtually everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, in the absence of finance, a State Ministry is tasked with drafting draft legislation by private law firms which are closely interwoven with industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer emanates from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracies are now rapidly entering into a situation described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in decay, and the offices have been occupied by force.
Against bribe, by illegal sneaking advantage or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unrestrained, and the people went to the polls with already bought votes" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected.".. Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with sole domination.
As can be seen, today's society, as in antiquity, is founded on the reckless preference of one's own advantage, without paying attention to social interests as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature not in a position to recognise and enforce the advantage for the entire society.
The result, both now and then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not at all striving for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already beginning.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are completely ignorant of the potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and more recent history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population downwards.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase state ownership of the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...so that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no war," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, numerous reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is responsible in these recurring waves of killing and who is the victim; in the end, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence itself.
It's about opening the reader's eyes behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (as of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are especially useful in the small patch of land in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out especially, which could be called the head of the octopus (I don't know if anyone else is standing above them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century, in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the increase of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or prepare themselves for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only four remained, while Russia in the meantime subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank; during the Civil War, he began to issue his own (i.e. state) banknotes and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The global desire for power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Mason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break Britain's colonial domination in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and luxury and would not consume so much resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism here is nothing more than the advance) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that crises such as the one they triggered in 1907 do not recur).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsar empire), and then the dissolution of the Central European Grand Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to be able to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers had politics create a latent conflict situation by filling Germany with gigantic war repairs; thereby they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans a sufficiently strong leader, who offered the culprits named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to assume and also took the function of a fifth column in order to ignite the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was the first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke off the chain that the international bankers initially held him on, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the ground for the Second World War was prepared by the war-reparations against Germany, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line of struggle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East, just like in World War II.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply the people divide themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are exclusively putting their own candidates to the vote.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers who is doing everything possible to spark a war with Iran, which could rapidly expand into a global conflict in view of Iran's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), and which could result in the destruction of the world economy due to Iran's control over the only two-mile-wide road of Hormus, which is 20% of world oil supplies.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-embracing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their conception, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip to subjugate this being to total control.
"And it is that the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the mark, namely, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has understanding, consider the number of the beast.
For there is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the USA after the revolution, who had maintained the patronage of his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to release the hostage made everything worse.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been arranged by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the USA a small partial victory.
Six embassy staff managed to escape immediately before the embassy was occupied.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert on "exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
For the cover to become credible, articles on this film project appeared in professional journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politthriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie," i.e. the story of a successful Hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film alternate - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, in the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime novel Kein Kinderspiel (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film, which doesn't play in the director's native Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywoods.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are played in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictable that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the wrong film stick on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story doesn't actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the little he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality a little - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or also the chase on the runway, seem something artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
As a result, Affleck's film loses a bit of traction. It is a film that you can follow with a certain interest and at the same time gout the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history still alive in a certain way and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the almighty and omniscient secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the inflation of balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls out a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to organize the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"This idea was inspired by the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% women's quota in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the mandatory incorporation of bioethanol into fuels, which as a result is damaging to nature, and the ban on reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs considerably more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism has also been expressed about the actual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks by veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "curvature anomaly."
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it merely harmonises the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have already been softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries, indicating that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under the age of eight cannot inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairgrounds.
Curious ideas are also available at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated not only the aforementioned absurdities but also the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus determined the maximum volume of food stocks that could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for preserved mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey organisers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), then Minister of Agriculture, in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and that the state camps were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally approached the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered funding for applications for funding to the municipalities, in particular for funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to promote the effectiveness and development of the whole European Union deserve more recognition.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing at all in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States in the budget negotiations.
Emotions in this country also evoke the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák."
Rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham now also includes Karlovy Vary Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or Saaz hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic gingerbread or the Hořicer rolls can boast.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for President's office?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, how thieves walk around freely, while people are being raised in taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I am already over 40, independent and non-partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than running for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then you made your way to the castle.
Don't you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to start the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for the office of President if I was elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, are scolding in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we are destroying anyone who wants to change something.
Add to that the media, who want to rob you of the honor, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You started the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets of more than 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have campaigned for the guide to remain a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the petty-spiritual policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-party, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without the thought of drawers and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It's important to me that we move on.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like someone calling you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this.
We can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you only have keywords.
And that doesn't mean you can't get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed in enforcing material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers would have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality pointing to maladministration can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the President, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can't achieve anything on my own, so I talked to several well-known figures about whether they would like to run for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen such a composition of the Senate that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district captains.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; my transparent account is only CZK 20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about declarations of wealth, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private assets to be about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another one for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a children's dream - James Bond always liked how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make debts?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So you're gonna keep working as an entrepreneur to make your living?
Didn't you say you were going to go back to these activities?
But that's not related to the salary level.
As promised, I've partly returned my activities.
For example, my deputy becomes managing director of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would stop my activities entirely.

The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the mind - with the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by at the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's going to one of those old-style libraries today, is it?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town at the gates of Rotterdam, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants community has the lowest educational rate in the Netherlands as a whole.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general formation and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the Euroscheins as beautifully brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way to master statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of the cool bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with familiar serenity and appeared for the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin in his face.
And while the jury was still looking around and shrugging with the armpits, the cheeky Maas stacked his exquisite souvenirs of greatness to a pyramid and finished his actionist speech with the words: "Dear city council!"
So this is it, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is filled up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town resort, which up to now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory in order to richer a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasures of space and reading open up when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lanterns speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already looking for park bench, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"The bookshelves usually stand along the façade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and put the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is skilfully used: offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center are located in the center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes balustrade, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, haptic and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so one day we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimeter thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in greenhouses and fields.
That's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-resistant material that smells like a bit of new cars and a bit of a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you arrive at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-metre-long walk, the Literaturcafé rewards you not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all for the correct humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass fall, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly inside.
The broad wood glue binders, which stand across the glass façade, serve as shade and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest do fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg Spijkenisses "the recently overdue soul."
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has been established.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for adornment.
Thus MVRDV has succeeded in the supreme discipline, which is called in the jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing it on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently changing its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the US, so to speak, towards a German foreign policy.
What is more, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching on their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to push the public, but also the elites, to the head in the Arab countries.
That definitely matters.
But I wouldn't want to put too much weight on that either, that's not a totally unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly advocated a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government has in secret quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can't be part of a broader line and have to push things out of their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even because of its relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive subject.
But I believe that the Germans understand that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not yet used to it, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this sense, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this is an officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the origin companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in intellectual property violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for imitators to register their trademarks.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you let Prada-Kny enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in the injured intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, however, he assumes that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
That means women fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is watered down, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can take place, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed complaints because, after the long period of time, the contested name had become a "market reality."
If the plaintiff had bad luck, he would even have to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese can therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was cleared, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality."
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings had decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still pending in the office.
To tackle this costs a lot
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record record and means that China is leading the list of new applications around the world for the tenth time in a row, the agency informs.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were charged.
Simply this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs a lot, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to obtain that its illegal production of imitation parts of vehicles was lifted.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One had failed to do so, because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Executive Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO rejected the Munich appeal.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opposing party continues to fight today.
You gotta watch out in hell
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be calculated that the company archive had to look through even one hundred years old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to shrink back into Europe.
That's when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
A Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business field, yet it has been able to avert registration.
"You have to watch out in hell," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful about business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather the foreigners should register "everything that is somehow worth protecting, also in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg were to lie in the last act of his brand drama, one would probably have to pay the opposite side royalties for one's own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice.
The story of a connection that surpasses far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - crowd, enthrall and persecute themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his softly wild gestures.
It's Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and it also has a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self Help
Worldwide, there are about 34 million HIV infected people, according to Unaids, the United Nations program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
245000 AIDS orphans live in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
You can sponsor for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or praisers.
The Bantu language can speak fluently no one in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign, soft language, and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: in the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometers ascent from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni there is little evidence of what all of Swaziland suffers from: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of contagion by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in them, dying in the middle of thirty is not a rarity.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who did not only lack parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has been taking care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally ever since.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human pappilomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and trippers are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), tripper and human papilomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless, this group accounts for around 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papilomavirus are common in adolescents in this country.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urinating, discharge, abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis of most STIs can be cured and late consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the gagen, which the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"Overall, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also cares for the orphans to stay well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time every day for school lessons.
Those who have no more come to the shelter at Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association just as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because, as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, they are most likely to be dead.
A King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - Flesh to Flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through South Africa every two or three years together and sings songs full of audacity, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many know at the southern tip of the black continent even from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has given some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light" the people there say.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers ascent to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover should possibly be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one relates the discovery of ice but the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Small peepholes in infinite expanses.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image detail of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are to be recognized as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the star circle room.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has taken the Nasa Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star hurled out in the dying process.
In the giant trifid nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
The Nasa Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors come better to the point.
Like a red Age, the Helix fog looks towards the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star picture.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title North America.

One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Jacuzzi Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid nebula in the constellation Schütze, several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, three divided), because dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation Snake Carriers, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carambol: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not have technical abbreviations may call them the Southern Firewheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1,400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble Space Telescope for the Nasa.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star fog is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star-cradle always produces new youngsters.
This star cloud, coupled with the rosette nebula, also continuously produces new baby stars - 5000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only created shortly after the Big Bang when hydrogen was mainly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become bigger and bigger - and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope was the largest telescope in the world in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It lets eyes into space over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is lashed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby-eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the elevation angle.
Its speciality: the high light collecting force.
Despite its comparatively low mirror diameter, this reaches those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is where the Very Large Telescope stands - which honors his name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should cover a whopping 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an illustration to marvel at.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most important impressions from space.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The last launch preparations on the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the picture.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot into space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messenger orbits far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been indicating that there is ice on Mercury for decades.
Through the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to circle around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, sweeping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfect Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very durable.
End of the line is Lerik.
The small town boasts too much Soviet architecture, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the approach from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-lane.
The legendary wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pila Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area is documented, older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 still a child was born
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The husband had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was said to have had one daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov calculate his age by a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"Strikingly many high-age people also exist in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age was to be provided, especially since civil status registers were missing.
Butter melted every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are strikingly often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why are there so many elderly people living here in the south?
The asian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of Talyschen.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
But the fact that the high calorie diet of the Talyschen should be so healthy, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, also does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik.
With her 97 years she is still comparatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of whom have long since been grandparents.
Two toddlers are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared tea, which is served in the typical belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in line and limb, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out on me and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension goes to life
She always ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I haven't bought groceries at the supermarket once.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham later took over the helm.
After all, there is no need for Azerbaijan's old.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grown son is right: "The old people enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as a basis is controversial.
The Egyptian president didn't save on pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For they are all, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, afraid.
Fear of a divine state on the Nile by graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are not quite aware of that.
Should the judiciary be cut off?
Indeed, the 234 articles whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly in a nighttime 15-hour parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that jurisdiction is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the accompanying legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: in all matters concerning Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
That doesn't have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto result in the dismissal of the judiciary.
Much of the draft text is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts served to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, according to the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote their morality and values."
This is so vaguely formulated by law that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this, another one forbids to insult or slander the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Similarly, the phrase "insulting people" seems dubious.
Is there enough caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
The interpretation of how so many things in the draft, which Morsi has for signature and according to his words "very soon," will be presented to the Egyptians for referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming itself for weeks against the Islamists' superiority.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution belongs "to the garbage mountain of history."
Via short news service Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy."
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced they didn't want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood in turn blew into a counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafists took part in it and shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law. "
They demanded of Morsi: "Clean the land!" and declared: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the emblematic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have brought about conditions similar to civil war.
Mursi's followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brothers declared that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even exist"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involving all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday."
Morsi extended power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President effectively overrides it," says Saeda.
But democracy could not work without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels left alone, also from the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle towards the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "You bear a monster you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst-smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the midst of a bunch of dirty, humid sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
About this one has to imagine the nasty smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt, which - depending on how stinking one would like to have its fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this speciality, which is really very captivating.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "rakfisk general."
Around us, people consume small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," Havard says.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'll taste some snacks.
If you avoid getting the rakfisk close to the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has had a quite long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly under the help of alcohol damped senses.
Even before a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the USA.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too long ago much richer than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential, though strictly smelly, part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the "accident of July 22."
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for Norway's present wealth has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are - as they say - a prudent people.
Like most people here, their English is flawless.
We don't like bragging, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's revenues will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global economic crisis, when everyone threw money around, which they didn't own at all, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand up for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
A moose burger like that is definitely something else.
But in the evening the stinkfish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls off his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe haze of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor.
Even on better days, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which blocks off several important traffic routes to the capital and creates chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before joining the US President, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A Direct Man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the development of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaquets with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect from him real and lasting changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and the economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition's allegations, the new president's lack of substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an outstanding statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was engaged to fight drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left on a patch of wasteland near a large landfill.
During Governor Pena Nieto's term of office, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women's murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government had closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights with tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the morgue had already been deployed.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied to her until now.
The authorities treated me as if I was a chatter, a troublemaker, a moustache.
They want you to just accept their verdict and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many formal errors and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the President's bond on Saturday, he also takes on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to deal with this problem in particular during his term of office.
"I hope that as president he is the same as he was governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
The prosecution claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he has been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of harsh prison conditions
The U.S. Army Private is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor's office tried to find that Army Private Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in US history - failed to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents relating to weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard term - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he had been in prison under increased detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and that the treatment by the institution as a whole was "very professional."
The forms, according to Fein, did not contain any complaints about maltreatment, even though the officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them. However, they had not been logged.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that did not necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn't complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal ideation he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of injuries."
The military claimed that it had assigned this restrictive status - one level under the threat of suicide - to it and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and to get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had become unconscious due to the heat.
Not knowing what was happening to him or to the outside world was incriminating.
"My world shrunk at Camp Arafjon, on this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
They only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he was trying to keep moving, because the day was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Military Prison.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico for one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners on a morning count.
Manning had testified that during this count he had never had the opportunity to envelop himself with his blanket.
During the interview on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and drastically reduce his detention if he is sentenced to trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty of lesser offences, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
Continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecutor's office is expected to justify the terms of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security precautions in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include the favoring of the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all counts, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport check when perplexity spread inside me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Ausländer").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian."
Later, I chose "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrated to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he didn't mention any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the United States coming to Mexico in 1848 and forcing the country's leadership under a gun to leave more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath.
And yet Mexico's biggest challenge is in fact in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is with them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may have now lived the American dream, attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we are living - not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our gang to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't be caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexicans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent this.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they are not one country or the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted in them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to choke such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blames, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis - and for the first time rockets from Gaza have been launched near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week's struggles have strengthened the hard-bedded on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its group itself has suffered huge losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are infiltrated in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold of Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist coin could stand before Bashar Assad's storm, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is constricted with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the recent escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers - not least thanks to the barriers that flow into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. However, these protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal by international law, are constantly being developed.
Netanyahu is well standing. His Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why also these deceitful Palestinians pamper and leave them a state of their own?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their comrades in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could put a line on them.
Even if the Islamists, now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi met Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis, too, should think longer.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus in Tel Aviv exploded this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in Gaza will increasingly demand diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states where Israel is leaving for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to implement this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms supplies in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than for the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must help to get Israel to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems that he is also averse to participation.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian uniform cigarette packaging laws enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and babies and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, there will be the only difference between the packs in the brand names printed in identical, small font from Saturday onwards.
Australia is thus introducing the world's most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 are not likely to start smoking at 99% after that.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on Australia's streets.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Court of Australia to challenge the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop designing cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only one small area left to advertise its products doesn't come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people."
You have to ask yourself the question: is this just a private person who finds so much pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are trading more with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a quilt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage, buying a cigarette box on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to replenish its shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we shut down," he adds visibly infuriated.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored too
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I've had enough time to get bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight at the airport for half a day is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom than something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively topical phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), doesn't think so.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfactory job but not being able to do it."
Boredom therefore differs from apathy to the fact that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in "disturbing the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and feeling that time is only slowly passing away."
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German, for example: "The idle mind: the definition of boredom under the aspect of attention," which appeared in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they were bored more than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could find no reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, one does a monotonous job - "like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that zapping and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hack around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom susceptibility" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tight bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "young people are perceived as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their everyday routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. Professor Vodanovich is of this opinion, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best right now.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
But television can make you feel lucky in the short term, but these vanish in the long run.
So if you're going to give your bored child an iPad, you can get rid of boredom. However, it hasn't learned to talk or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to talk, but also receives more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we need to be bored more often. But boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to shut down and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is silent."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands in south-east Colorado for an offense that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few marijuana bucks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the Kansas border when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier offences, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.
"We're being treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of illegal acts that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over 21 years of age for property to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative counties of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is in any case ahead of most states as far as regulation of marijuana is concerned, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, Spokesman of the Washington State Spirits Supervisory Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the end point of a gray zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And uncomfortable practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the government's requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his staff in Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer persecute minor marijuana in people over 21 years of age, and that the police would not "as of now" seek any criminal charges for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate medical marijuana growers and continue to prosecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck holds a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to persuade consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged for other crimes.
"Our authority has the duty to prosecute infringements that were criminal offences at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are even ambiguous in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marijuana Initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer indicate adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal systems.
And the conflicting reactions across the state led to a deep conflict among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District Attorneys are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing Marijuana Defendants and acting on the ground as spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for still unable to accept legalization," he believes.
Colorado and Washington are the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana as alcohol, as national models for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration, believes that although criminals are unlikely to enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado aren't even waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local authorities approved moratoria for new marijuana businesses, although they could not open until about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban, which will probably be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change of law.
We are guided by what the community has chosen and not by what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only today's university students are attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once thought was the world's greatest temple of knowledge, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College in the late eighties - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and caused the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson mischievously declared that I had left the university because I was forced to drink out of damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been harassed only for one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I advocated the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate-right students suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded equal equality protection, which benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They call for a place on the equality committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which portrayed Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazi.
Among other things, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, who drove in a Rolls-Royce with silver-colored suit and silver-plated walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "boats of sin for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday paper: "There is a growing leftist tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historian in Corpus Christi, who initiated the application for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant." Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old President-elect of Oxford's Conservative Student Union, says that she has observed a growing rejection of JCR members towards students of moderate rights.
"This represents a danger to intellectual discourse and the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even terrified Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students met each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but also took part in it with joy.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like pie dough, and pretty nasty.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
My eyes were filled with tears.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone in college at dinner when someone typed me slightly on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be Labour Party supporters.
In a local pub, I later tried to pretend.
I insisted that I didn't agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics, and economics, ironically attending the conservative Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig. "
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of eternity and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and made speeches for her.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for his Marxist-Determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open - minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower tips.
Even my Communist friends always showed flawless manners.
His wet eyes were clouding.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're being teased.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although secretly shattered with shame, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed " me and called them "old fools. "
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who punched the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a weeping pussy.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but is still hiding behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Masters of Couture," which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashionmaker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture," a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses have been put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the embroidered and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there are a large number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, ranging from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashionmaker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't step out on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashionmaker.
Many years ago we went to his home for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "Top Model," which began its career at the Week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk that proposes a role-change: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a coat of wool and leather belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit von Norway, Rosario von Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the ex-duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg can not forget for the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to that.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped bodice with a décolleté that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion designer's evening dresses "with absolute care," "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it."
The "King " of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashionist called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-metre tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society."
For years the elite's "savoir-être," Valentino is now their best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, garavani accumulated as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace of him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur across the steep, stony paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this purpose, it must descend to the bottom of its crater every day, where the sulphurous gas emitted from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted beams take more than 40 minutes to ascend at the turtle's pace, keeping the balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulphur they break down.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the Libra, which a mining company has placed a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the deposits in the volcano since 1960 and (never better) its workers to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely finished, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid during the coffee harvest a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the bearer, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at risk for three years at Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left him the first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrying chair.
It divides a dirty wooden hut with other beams and rises every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluishly in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the reduction of sulphur in order to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) supplement per camera, which the guardians of this nature park together with the entry fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrying island.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people," Madrusin protests, a 42-year-old bearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are stuck in the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders, which have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the Tamansari camp at 18 kilometers distance.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulphur carrier with his 30 years of age.
Time passes, but poorness lasts generation to generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as human vices at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the fact that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the raising of children.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: let's fulfill our civic duty and let's create lives!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an ad for mint candy, but still - or just because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "sliding will be a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who filmed the video, maintains the hope that the commercial will reach out to the problem in a fun way.
Her creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty."
This is just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
In planting we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue easy is the Singapore government.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its National Population Authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have kids anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to have much more options in terms of life goals and priorities, except to get married and form a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single persons and the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely laminated xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore ruling party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoeshoes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer orientations, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed out, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, the stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - there is still so much the government can do.
The offline private offline is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference. "
What's private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed in to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just upload them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone suggested a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"That doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone pushes me or demands it from me, I simply remove it from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unaware of experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He only did it privately."
Afterwards, he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he wasn't nice to me or I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants," formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants they are supposed to teach, when we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published or said, at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective, if they care about being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the skilled person, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions a few possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to publish a photo of you, like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission if you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: must everyone know what you are doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they need to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educator, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You must not speak to strangers."
Completion of Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was theoretically to be signed by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources at the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the exam, but subsequently stated that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was limited at all times.
During the day in the press room only the image of the President's meeting without sound was transmitted with the message "private session, limited audio."
The few information circulating among journalists was received from the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was Humala's declaration and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite the press's urging, the so-called declaration of Lima, which had previously been announced, was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but they limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the trial that Lima initiated against Santiago, to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently making to this international court," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," adds Piñera, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
Both presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of that international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unassur since 2011 after the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and finished the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the Unassur countries will "take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He stated that measures were being taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on a triumphant trait, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve spatial links in South America, especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new forms of economic activity," said the Peruvian President in a recited statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which would provide a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in order to treat the maritime conflict respectfully according to an IGH ruling challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will examine all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also requires talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Block's Defence Ministers also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is presided over during the period of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually learning something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "were killed in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unassur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community, must be achieved; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States," he declared as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that there were "reasoned assumptions at the time that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his procedure would not be respected."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish case law allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be impaired.
"Since he has been in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there was a risk that he would suffer physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a tight space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free letter, which allowed him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a number of proceedings at various European authorities," he explained.
And "if the UK grants this free letter tomorrow, I think it's done."
And when Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or Skype, as the Swedish case law allows and in other cases was done, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention, and the lie that disproves freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself on the fact that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and not by bankers or hegemonic and petty bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election, he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unassur until at least its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not stand up to opportunism and no coup d'état disguised as legally" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now, and according to the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which preferred the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely entitled."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also trusted in the same Court of Justice for a good conclusion of disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile, and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries commit themselves to taking the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to achieve his third mandate in a row, he stated that he sees this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as President, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for scheduled routine treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death due to AIDS today is too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the results of the study: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken down" without any noticeable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such commitment that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient taking up treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 the scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that those who are not addicted to drugs have greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "easily age 75 as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA's annual report), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died since AIDS appeared.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths by May of this year; however, it is assured that universal access to antiretroviral medicines has been available since 2005.
- So why are people still dying of it?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no medical supply problems. The problem is that people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, which is why all persons who need it must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is supported by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, for the only reason that he had made a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancerous tumour), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I prefer to burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are now afraid in the context of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should take the test if they are part of the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the risk persons for new infections are adolescents.
"What do you need them for?" is a common mockery of social workers, oriental staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and the health care system that young people do not want to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution should be reoriented; the condoms should not only be located behind the counter, but also in output equipment in public toilets of institutions often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They are not to be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question as to whether he would distribute the praesidium under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key Data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Nationally, the state is in fourth place in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the contagion cases are by sexual intercourse, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the United States Court of Appeal has upheld a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities, which has been achieved through a trade agreement in Mexico, a disastrous precedent is created for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
One could therefore say that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws in the country of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements, are not valid.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the northern district of Texas leads to the fact that Mexican companies are helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to refer three inconsistencies to the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all says that the main proceedings are the trade course dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, using the American Law Institute as a conciliator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies, the necessary majority for the restructuring of liabilities would not have been achieved after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass that Vitro's branches had with their parent company.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Concourses) among the Group's companies.
It is also true that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergenceia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of his difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States that struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same Court of Appeals for the vote to be held in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare appeal, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, will be filed in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious issue in this case is that the Court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), in which Vitro's proceedings are described under the Act on Trade Concourses, pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambols: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican aviation unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, did not progress for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Union of Pilots) has finally made progress.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau's application has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from Bank IXE's F/589 trustee account under the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the Wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has reached the point of uniting the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental institution, which partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has not complied with a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan has not signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it regarded them as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock exchange certificates to the market of over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Founding of Competival
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment amounts to more than 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, authorised representative and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"For my whole life I've put on a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-fifties as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-managing director or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships consecutively from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a naturalist and was one of our best throwers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had made a championship possible for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy on the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the US.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee, who let us repeat the last turn for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Championship.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz) back in the team, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the locked players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal contrary to any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work from the boys.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the bandage?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and sometimes going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas and became world famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas," where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked the most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in the hospital of Dallas, told her journalist Jeffrey Lane.
He gave joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," said Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he was undergoing transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman became known on television as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also the actor of two comedies that were only broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included critically well-rated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly detestable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?" that was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.

When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who transformed "Dallas" into the second most popular entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had pregnant her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others also had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) committed.
"I know what to put on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-actor of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and outside the screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and remains in our hearts for those who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the station informed.
From Warner or from TNT, there was no immediate explanation of how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't write anything that I thought could harm anyone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he volunteered for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as, "Don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the "End of the World " Course
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Each semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long backward counting" on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there ever was," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last one in history.
In Temple, the associate professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World."
"We don't record 2012 so that we can always keep the option of holding the course back, in case the world doesn't go down," Restall said.
Despite the "current downfall," students have to study, prepare projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for high-average students who filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were any places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a question of consolation or its absence.
25-year-old student Will Weekesa for Psychology and Nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"Never have I heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less even one professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"People don't think that way elsewhere," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period, according to which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said that they want to go to celebrations about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
