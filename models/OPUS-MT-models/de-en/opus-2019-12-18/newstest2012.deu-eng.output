No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian parliament refused the request to abolish those clauses on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted in the context of a amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned expremier minister, was rejected by the MEPs at the second reading of the request to mitigate the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, in December the appeal of the convicted persons is to be negotiated in court.
Timoshenko himself described the sentence as a political revenge of the regime and in the West, too, the trial raised suspicions of the prejudice of the court.
The request to remove Section 365 from the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the Expremier Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is common for this region, victorious in the elections Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary law of the Sharīʿa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for stealing you cut off your hand in short.
Women too should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, any apostates of faith will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Qur'an from mutually opposed tribes.
In short, Libya will have an order that would be hard to imagine and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Just - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly suit the Libyans mentioned.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
For their excuse, it may only be the fact that NATO's airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a fire exchange, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
This leaves the heresy with a concern - the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But will the oil companies also receive black gold at a mockery price without occupation?
It is hardly and so that the West can finally boast of its unselfishness in terms of the protection of human rights.
Unless this destroys them by the Sharīʿa representatives.
Launch of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, while Germany and France were growing.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, while France's GDP grew by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
In comparison to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and according to Tsch. Statistical Office thus confirmed the trend of the slowdown in economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds climbed to 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, voices are voiced that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-arranged goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from home matches and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection was also very successful thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro 1:0 and has thus redeemed their ticket for the football championship.
Due to the precise defense game of the Czech team, they were only able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The bad luck birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be part of the European Championships next year, and it is also pleasing that the Austrian football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, quite militant football was played.
Both teams combined a long time and so was played mainly around the center line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team remained out and the large reductions before the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
Several hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object at noon on Tuesday and then proclaimed death to the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, made a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to make it clear that they were willing to protect their country's core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have long since given up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then proclaimed death to the US and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, if the Iranian nuclear program was to be largely paralysed, the nuclear enrichment plant at Natan's target would also be from the center in Isfahan.
A fat child's menu: It doesn't eat breakfast and eats sausage for supper
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children usually come from unhealthy families.
This shows once again how important the milieu in which he grows up is for the healthy development of a human being and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before the reconnaissance under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence."
In families with fat people, sports are not exactly one of the favourite activities, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools in the whole of the Czech Republic being interviewed.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence," which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed indicated eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-evening bread five times a day - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for supper
Experts point out that relatively small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils' families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
The worst thing was the fact that every tenth family did not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey test showed that families of overweight children consume unhealthy fries much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Match your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own menu from the opportunities offered for appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, desserts.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet sodas," is emphasized in the final report to this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pasta won just in front of poultry.
Legumes almost didn't like the children at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was also very low.
Returning to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In many cases, the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the enlightening presentation "Adiposity is not a coincidence" showed a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project point out.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also used poultry or fish much more often as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had tasted a little bit that it was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn't even know what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this works "in the square."
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the examination moves, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
And that's most of us.
Some have too short a neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually mask broad shoulders, to extend the neck or to conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a female type like Jennifer Lopez - with a big bosom, broad hip and narrow waist - pretty and figurative, without it being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least let yourself be tailor-made.
I'm sure you won't regret it, because well - sitting clothes are just priceless.
In such a bespoke skirt you feel much better than in one of the poles, which is always too high and slipped, in the waist, etc.
Boylike figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, bunches, appliqués, embroidery or ruffle.
With this amount of information and character types, I'm glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my head.
And yet, I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do in the face of the assigned homework.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity for whom she is supposed to design suitable outfits - daywear and evening robe.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased in recent times to the hundred kilos (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut out the garments from magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then process them graphically.
In the "moodboard," as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about character types was seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And mailed stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put heel shoes on it and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks very different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But the most appropriate advice was: "First, you must know the rules perfectly. "
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
I finally realize why we need to pauke all these teachings, what we can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see something quite different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak of ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So all of this has to be reckoned with when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed that image and style sometimes make up half of the success.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often think this is money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if any of us let ourselves be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to have a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then all you have to do is google to find out with certainty that the tabloid press writes, that the corresponding celebrity is back on or off, etc.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario encouraged us not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "construct" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he styles, and he has to be a smart psychologist.
Evaluate people without bewitching themselves and stand by his opinion.
"If some manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add some pretty pieces, then we can't clean out the whole wardrobe and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can do," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "place pocket" must contain.
So a bag that you button at the waist and in which you carry with you all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, strippers to remove hair or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is removed from the back if it is too large (socket needles or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing stuff.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were glued and glued to o...
With the scissors you must not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to be clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend's continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - devoting oneself to styling at a professional level is not child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant mistakes to the routine journey to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what good is that when obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the long-standing game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he didn't seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the adapted passages fail, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are already used to at NFS, in the end a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, i.e. on the west coast, you get on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphic does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing moving around the world.
But the journey through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape looks visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, atypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be hellishly careful not to get spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you still expect a personal duel with a single competitor.
And that's what the police are trying to do. They're trying to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It's more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (in concrete terms only three).
Ultimately, this is more for the benefit of the game, because at least this element has no chance of getting bored - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model moves in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, it could not be said that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model will continue to do well for action-packed racing, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything will be fine.
Real problems only appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
From a game of this kind, it is hardly to be expected that it will calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how the car behaves before any impact on any object, then obviously everything is not okay.
Typical example: When passing or passing close cars, one "trips" the other car only easily in some places, but in other, almost identical situations one gets into the sling and spins wild pirouettes.
Or you're gonna take the car to shit.
Thanks to the Restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, but it's annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you've exhausted it, everything starts over...
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even the residual type helps, nothing but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to go through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit through.
Elsewhere you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes by two cars in front of a game, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The competitors have further advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and again without regard to the time.
Most crazy is to finish the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent's got to make up for one of these guys, obviously, coming out of here on the devil.
And if he's in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you start driving your own car a few times in Klump.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly prevents you from enjoying the game.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so loaded with action that you almost no longer know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what is "guilt" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the races.
One must not overlook the petrol stations along the route, because it is precisely here that one can change the car, although in most cases the car that one has just had is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American saloons for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical trips, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
The task mode (Challenges) also goes hand in hand with the mode of game history - that is, the races in the individual locations you know from history.
Here, there are not only medals, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to get to the higher level of the driver, different items have to be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also connected to the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the own results achieved with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (meinetwegen), where you rest in the dark on the rails long (meinetwegen).
On the speedometer there are numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (meinewegen), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and goes uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial office, we will argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think us to be so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that with some exciting moments the refresh rate is slowing down and sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies particularly to accidents involving a larger number of participants, where continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The soundtrack is as far as OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address a scale as wide as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá was created "of everyone something" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game weren't reduced by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have said with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared for these mistakes with the power of airport headlights in your eyes.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the various institutions to a palpable end."
I didn't expect such a hard war to start."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth down and everyone will have become accustomed to their new role," Milena Vicenová, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law quite sharply.
In the first part of her lecture, she showed how seriously she took the motto "Understandable and open about Europe," in which she succeeded in describing the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envyed many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning there was criticism that he was too unobtrusive - a gray official who was not up to such a role, but I have to say that it took everyone's breath away from how well he took on the matter.
"He is a person who can patiently listen to, communicate with, and, above all, have clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? Which number should I call?" - that is, as an important step towards the unification and better legibility of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil cap Quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda for the European Union to live, live and live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency as a success two years ago.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the case of the government during the Presidency as a major negative, which had greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite hectic.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes things much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a sleek and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive more and which less funding - all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe."
"If I don't like something, it's grayish shortcuts, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How should I, as a citizen, know whether we really think of crooked cucumbers or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes in Brussels or whether someone really wants to ban us from doing so?
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
In the opinion of the EU Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics who perceive the negative side of the matter more than the positive side.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me means: "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and doing so makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, above all, tough rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
As much more real, as a "European Federation," it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only those countries that want to work together and those who don't want to work together should be quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds," Ms Vicenová expects.
In this respect, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the eurozone.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has passed a century since it was founded.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already spoke of the slogan that countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the hallmark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else all around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will achieve even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thought-out system
Watson already had social care for his employees in the thirties - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid vacation, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful pay system for best newers and traders.
The long-term relationships between IBM and its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the very beginning, the company was ingenious in talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced by a woman at the head of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken up the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," Economist said the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the states of its logo because of its family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies in the world - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and already five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his most famous inventions are e.g. ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or also the floppy disk.
With approximately $220 billion of stock market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (just after Apple), with Microsoft overtaking it for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unhappy were, for example, the attempt with the OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally committed to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, leaving them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising Technologies
One fifth of IBM's profits are attributable to services, software and hardware.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-giving assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in purchasing promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment volume in the middle of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM will survive today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent rocket-like since 2008 and the company's net profit is growing continuously.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutters to spaceflights
Founded 100 years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken over only in 1924 - originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous flashcard clocks for registering the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired Thomas J. Watson, head of the competition, to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shade - on Watson's ideas the invincible culture and identity of the company is still based today.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades when Watson ran the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he sat in the boss's chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960 ' s, IBM technicians and computers helped NASA flight into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also to the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off in the last three years is the concept of "Smart Planet."
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas that have not even been planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform to help retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - as the first country ever in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-class top research team that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become her lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Josef would awaken from his rosy dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she probably wouldn't even have dreamed of how to do that with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to Říčany after 30 days, Josef went with her.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, indeed, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not be welcomed at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our home together, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked the back door for him has so far been borne by Josef with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, that doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company keeps running, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'll make the purchases."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all responsibility.
The Worst Female Undoings: How about you?
When men are asked to name some typical feminine mischiefs, they shake some promptly out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we pass a few immoral reverence again, which let the men flow the blood in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does her husband accuse them of being shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one stride per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more with promotions?
Then I think your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping lust under control halfway.
But hand on heart, which woman can bear to stroll through a dress shop in search of a well-sitting outerwear and not try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told her husband - you'd better stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Aren't I too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that look familiar to you?
Yeah?
Then I guess you're one of the women who's really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger gender is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more uncompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
If you scold your partner because he trampled on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, did you rebuke the children, because the currently scrubbed sink is dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, when polishing is so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance," then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not in the first place.
In the end, this excess of purity can also harm mutual relations and, above all, the peace of the family.
Stingles
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put those old socks on again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't be surprised that it will put him on the palm tree.
Of course that's not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, where behind their backs they are whispered or even slandered or forged alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, which is why they like to overwhelm such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in store.
Hand on the heart - this is probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with clapping stars of the grossest caliber, to which nothing and no one is sacred, who despises everyone in their surroundings and who represents a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Jaromír Jágr, who played for the NHL on Mondays, made a major contribution to Philadelphia's 5-3 victory on the ice in Carolina, making him the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The winner of the overview of the thirty-ninth-year-old ice hockey star was Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was declared the best player of the match.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the same game.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalists that he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Already before the game I tell him that he succeeds in a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that."
"Hin und wieder überkommen einen such ein Führung gefallen," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal already at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later the second hit had "a Czech track."
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but I'm sure he's one of the top three," Jágr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have thought in my life that I would be playing with such an ice hockey player as with him at the end of my career."
"I'm really happy."
"I'm cutting my game toward me."
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players set their game on me and now the skewer turns around," smiled Jágr.
Carolina made the game a drama - with the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who won from a penalty shot, came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in overnumbering two against one.
"Excellent Pronger was still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) pulled to more distant poles."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last match of the match from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia placed himself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the match against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also lost their lead in the Penalty shooting 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not transform one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they only finished with five defense players.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the encounter with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change, one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and got the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P.K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec refused thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5-2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters took part.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold only travels to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, and only the chosen ones were allowed to travel to the West.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and Hungary to the Balaton.
One notable exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the travels to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern bloc (also Czechoslovakia) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of socialist countries.
For example, if a ČSSR citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or even the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge snakes or also stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, things hadn't worked out by a long time.
The so-called foreign currency announcement - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
In fact, the Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without foreign currency announcement it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in Germany, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dachshunds - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on its feet.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the nineties of the last century, foreign exchange obligations to neighbouring Western European countries were abolished, resulting in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech holidaymakers slept in the park while traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money to stay in the hotel or in a guesthouse at that time.
A typical feature of Czech foreign travel was a trunk packed with canned beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech krona - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to prepare regular trips through charter flights after 1997, making it incredibly cheaper for air travel than in the past, thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, already had non-devisory payments with all highly developed countries in the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvet" travel came in 2000 when, thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft fly annually with Czech passengers to far-away sunny countries; this year you fly directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
Every year, 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita for a single holiday stay, including the costs at the resort.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, and it threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement as to the electoral order to be chosen.
And without these, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his post, urging his colleagues to come to an agreement and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old tangles broke out again between the two federation chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was obvious on 16 September when the new Chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Smíchov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiations did not result in any result and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or also the officials with a power of attorney.
On this only point, at least partial agreement was reached, and the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law contributed to this, whose opinion was that representation on a proxy basis was not valid.
However, disputes over the electoral order continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity to the matter, at which meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, are in principle no longer on the agenda at all.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round in order to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The point of contention concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model needs to be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is supposedly willing to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote counting.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which it would be best not to turn the electoral order but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees, even if it turns out that the statutory electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that most of the time be elected according to the statutes."
"So that no absurd alternative variants can be devised, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time ran for the first time and in his comments was mainly against Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national team for the football championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If football first rides the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "bend" the regulations for their own purposes.
"Therefore, a new blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is not left.
Some negotiations should allegedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the generality of football will be complete until the qualifying match.
The charter aircraft, with which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not take off in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance and so they feverishly searched for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee still to the venue of the Barrage play.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have persuaded the split parties within the country's largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which is supposed to lead the Czech sport in the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers, could have made up a strong candidate before the Extraordinary General Meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have been involved in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favorite of choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that, in the event of his victory, he intends to pursue the role of Chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the chairman's position, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I spoke to some people in question personally."
"Unlikely to believe that some told me that they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's association with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should hold the position of chairman.
"In his victory, today's condition would be preserved and Czech football would not go ahead at all."
"Berbr's support, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
He also hinted that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interrogations to investigate in a corruption affair, but from which Pelta was subject to sanctions.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to (ch.) football."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who sees his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but more relaxed.
If Paclík wins in the Thursday election, however, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the October general meeting, who ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"For example, I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I'm not sticking my nose in matters I don't understand," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September by standing behind the dismissal of the referee committee with Luďěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels he has grown up in the role of chairman of the association.
And he relies on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been head of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which goes down to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not make a secret of his antipathy towards, for example, Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should be dedicated to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but then they also have to tell klipp and clear where the money is going," he said.
Paclík does not regard his connection to the Pilsner Klub as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "non-partisan."
Pelta, in turn, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Prague's Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense, however, to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Klub to a third person in order to return after one and a half years," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would lead to a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the chairing office, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would be strongly in favour of the FAČR getting new statutes, which in future exclude disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday trial in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself if the Czech selection is successful.
Pelta had already promised in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of funding if he was elected.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last Annual General Meeting, so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about the management of football and introduce him in a wider context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was run by someone, says the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked with Sparta and the Executive Committee for many years.
That is why he also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, articles of association were approved that were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September on," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association that he used as a means of attracting delegates.
"Should I become chairman, I will personally accept it and be willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"His attacks, however, were debilitating and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That is why many now doubt his true character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the reverberations of the corruption scandal from last year."
"Afterwards, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for all football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any human cleansing.
"I would have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, it is understandable that there is nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really the only contentious point is how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it only wins back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If former vice-president Jindřich Rajchl was elected new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly spoil the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that if you choose, you will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve Bohemian's case, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football and otherwise to continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses with miles in each segment."
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of criticizing the work of others, they themselves would have to start working really hard," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he had considered not running at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who don't constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"Many people told me, however, that I should not give up because otherwise others would do it."
"That's trust that you can't lose," he said.
Supposedly, he is also motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we've done a lot of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Protests have been started that will probably only come into effect in a few years' time and I would hate to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - were elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are mainly people who would make the soccer so that he would only be there for the chosen."
I guess I can be blamed for a lot, but not that I'm partial."
"I try to be objective."
"I want soccer for everyone, because everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even though some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would then be promoted to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is especially a problem for young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Now that the head of Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the fight for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, who also regards the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself partly for the fact that the association does not pull on a single string.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to regain confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and the staffing in the commissions would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would certainly not want to turn things in his favor," Rajchl judges about his rival.
Europe's Most Beautiful Pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in Ufo-Optics, magnificent pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike rest your tired legs in spa.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past one and a half years, one could not be missing in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Lying back on the water, she looked up in artfully designed domes, she swam towards marble putts waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she took it in her notebook - along with some interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recently published book "Badenfreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder - only in the water that's different.
It's annoying that swimming fans have to deal with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meders living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Plattering in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And when the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor one has a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While one has the whole city in mind from the Zurich roof bath, one can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which one can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bath guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
It vaporizes from three open bowls in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so much like fuel oil, which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder looked through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has counteracted the decay in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already been completed by this bathroom; not only are neo-Romanesque elements from the time it was built in 1844, but also a Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge so different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only a minor matter.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business look through
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank abandon its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity markets are driving prices up - and banks are thus partly responsible for the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumerists is specifically directed against German bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business would be "worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch Report.
The audit should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Board of Management of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank then wants to tell the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even a complete departure.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch boss Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Beting on rising food prices is a particularly drastic indication of how ruthless banks are now damaging the general good."
As the top bank lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly committed.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for bets on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank," he said.
At first glance, Ackermann's insight comes as a surprise, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive Officer would not change to the Supervisory Board as planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to sciss himself - that is what his successor would have to do.
Each second would quit raw material plants
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
As a result, just eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are wagered on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, every second would terminate all investments where money flows into the commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they were thinking about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy ends: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and decayed.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture is swarmed with clear shapes, glass halls, bold turns and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schneider is a fitting and famous example for the Brüssler World Exhibition in 1958.
==History==Schnacker's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the pavilion at the next World Exhibition of Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annex in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna's Südbahnhof, his pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20er Haus" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007, has completed the new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate in art historian with a remarkable career, among other things in youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly implemented the conversion with politicians and conservationists, raised public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the realization.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schicker at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "unbelievably important place" where he had "almost every weekend" looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in his transfer to Vienna and his re-use of generosity and ease.
There were far bigger problems with the current conversion: The building was "an energy hurler," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold-bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light ditch between house and street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light cock pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish brown rust protection shade.
And the cinema is still exactly as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the Monument Authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monument conservation office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It had been difficult with the pavilion "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness."
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urbanistic stroke of luck has occurred: Around the Swiss garden, the completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier" is being created, with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may occur: The 21er Haus could get reinforcements from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss Garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an intra-group crisis plan, that investments of around EUR 300 million were planned by 2015.
The aim is to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary turnouts.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with the government and industry, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned against train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years, the railway has been creating that it has to have ICE trains' axles tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break in Cologne's main station.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millions of Punishment in the USA
After the turmoil of Chief Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a millions' penance there.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank weren't enough, the industry giants are now catching up with their past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of seducing cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
During the financial crisis, such papers lost a lot of value and tore the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the approval of the two cash houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and is taking over from Pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to get replaced with the billion-dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also buttoned up other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though the events have been a few years ago, a sharp wind is currently blowing towards the banks in the US.
Investors and regulators have made countless lawsuits to obtain redress or to punish for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having overdivided the two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into mortgage deals worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank, too, has to face a lawsuit by FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $ 14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that Frankfurters stand for "significant losses" without, however, giving an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought over $10 billion worth of shares.
Until now, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies was only poorly forecast.
However, he had now read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offered services and created computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's strike in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM."
Buffett now revealed in the US business channel CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM had not yet known anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had made good profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies so far.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached, for example, a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
In addition to its 80 own subsidiaries, its Berkshire Hathaway holding also owns shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
Following the announcement of the Buffett investment, the IBM share increased by one percent on a pre-exchange basis.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell," Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now being revived.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being answered with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkish people, a spectre that has long been believed to be dead has returned: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah," on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish Community of Germany reacted calmly: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated a festive ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, togetherness had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media acts like a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which gives the background to the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" does not allow itself to draw this mental connection.
"It begins to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered who had paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the action of the police and their subsequent search success is discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not come up with a much sooner idea of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If there is continued slumbling here, the migrants have no choice but self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Inner peace in Germany depends very much on the kindness of the enlightenment and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What it means when inner peace in Germany is in danger was illustrated by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Brandruine of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event clearly showed the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks sharpened the sense of us on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was mainly criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's arson attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, but at the funeral in Cologne he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.In his speech, Kinkel listed how many charges the local Turks paid.
Quite as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the rule of law has been ever since.
In addition to the efforts to comprehensively clarify and re-evaluate extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Scandal Bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is located not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank in July, it had become known that he would start a nearly as spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was very happy, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity, and made friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
A UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and ripped around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only renowned in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, UBS' Chairman of the Board of Directors has also been considered a hit - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the Bank from February 2012.
And he is already taking over the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, that's gonna be tough.
He is not a banker, but an economist and a central banker and would certainly have needed a training period.
At one stroke, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has long earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank."
On the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager - and, on the other hand, has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
The UBS had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the hidden and solid, but also buffed-out Swiss asset manager combined it with ambitious goals: It also wanted to be a huge number in investment banking.
On the one hand, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world in 2007.
And on the other hand, it had advanced into the league of the world's largest banks as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells us: "My students at the time I always presented UBS as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was so wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was going wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli unexpectedly resigned, who until then was regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had left.
The bank's investment business had been messed with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but some of them, who until recently would still have run their noses over them: an intransparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so concealed that you didn't even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and Chairman Marcel Ospel, the second best-paid Swiss board member in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: In view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis, UBS was facing collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a compulsory convertible bond through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, UBS' balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times as large as Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
"Once again, we couldn't save UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers, who might have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty premium.
Thus UBS more or less openly confessed to having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for wealthy customers: the Nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both key areas of business: investment banking through misspectations and asset management through tax evasion assistance.
And just when it got a little quieter again, just as you thought the UBS would be able to do it again, there follows this unfortunate dealer story: A single dealer ripped up 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out that risk management in investment banking still doesn't work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been noted that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economist and Financial Professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The Chief Financial Officer of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it has no control over risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had started a long time ago to become guardians of the great fortunes of the world: no too great risks, security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic the world might sometimes collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
UBS' headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to private elitist banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is accessed through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe."
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
Both Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse have supplanted this idea of the Swiss bank, but at some point - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS has become much too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first gave it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss large bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million nation decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-Crash."
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs or about 45 billion euros in order to save the large bank before bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
Speaking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and grew ever further.
The two different predecessor banks of UBS were complementary: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Chief Executive Officer of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the bellyman, who has worked from banking to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: arrogance came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly made the same statement: Goldman Sachs is coming from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where UBS wanted to go, upstairs.
She had already succeeded in a few steps.
She played at the top in foreign exchange and stock trading.
However, a weakness was highlighted by business consultants who were commissioned: in the international interest rate business, in the banker's language "fixed income," there was a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS entered an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed securities on to American mortgage loans - but also retained risks itself.
Also, when other banks long ago sought to exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there," says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after the other had to go as the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS became a spin-off seat and are still shaky today.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: No more investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has prevailed: he is supposed to run UBS' business permanently, told Zuricher Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
==References==
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to ask himself now.
To date, he only says publicly that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of the US investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The curbed industrial production on the continent choked the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief from the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial assets in particular were on the sales listings.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values recorded a 0.6 percent decline at 12,078 points at the close of the trade.
In the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq Technology Exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax dropped by 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and stands for the end of the upswing.
The enterprises produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month, as Eurostat reported.
The US investors were sceptical about this: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe would not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there were further signs of weakness in banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early in his view to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett piled up a decade-old principle and joined the US technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the traditional group's share price and initially made it less than one percent higher than the trend in the trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
According to Buffett, he paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's share notes declined significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.

At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares increased by 630 shares, down by 1913, and remained unchanged by 82 shares.
Smart crows spread to cities
In many places, seedcrows are considered "problem birds": however, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities local residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows can no longer be obtained from the cities, said experts at the first Crow Symposium in the East Frisian Empty.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected seed crows: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005 a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
The city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer has found "the normal expulsion, the grueling, doesn't work."
Nests with water splash away or trees fall, often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, large colonies split up and spread out in other places."
The only possible exception is that of hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding countryside, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable that a combination of gruelling of animals from sensitive living areas and lock-out facilities would be possible in order to resettle them in other places.
"Info boards instead of chainsaws," on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens campaigned for a completely different approach to the animals: "A pimple in the face we can finally bear most confidently."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberg crow trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where signposts inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project was already accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but also make their own tools as aids.
Behavioural researchers at Cambridge University recently tested four seed crows as far as birds' intelligence is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crash a scaffold with stones to get to a moth larva.
Without a lot of training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of a stone in order to have the platform collapsed.
In a second attempt, the smart crows had to solve a trickier problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had put wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even managed to do this right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Leaded by double-successed superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship out of the 0:0 game perfect.
The Czechs made a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off playback with outsider Montenegro, after the playoff (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also had nothing on fire against Turkey at the 0-0, Ireland brought a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
The Estadio da Luz in Lisbon brought Portugal a custom-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick of around 30 meters into the meshes for the early lead.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English champion Manchester City put a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
The focus was then on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth consecutive European Champion to go to the European Championship in 1976.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to survive a second of shock in the early stages.
Capt. Petr Cech prevented a possible self-gate by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past the gate of Cech in the 40th minute from the rotation of the penalty space border.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the Czechs' already beaten world-class goalkeeper, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed Zagreb's soccer miracle.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has almost certainly to clear his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM final round.
The Turks almost got a dream start in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, assailant Kazim Kazim also could not sink the bouncer in the gate.
However, after the moment of shock, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made his place for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the game, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was the same for the guests.
Ireland pushed up the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible leadership hit.
But it was time in the 32nd minute.
After an accident by Pavel Londak, Ward was in position and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP will invest billions in China in the coming years and almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly," co-head Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees at present.
The number of branches of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers are located in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is almost rarely done before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror. A Story of World War I, narrated in Nineteen Destinies" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Carefully cut this page and turn it into your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he doesn't misrepresent as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Terror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war combined, from school girls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flares up like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating post-war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war inundates the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her kids and hears cannonfire in the distance.
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged.
"False facts," Englund notes, "were set up with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other published material.
Her life stories can be frightening or moving, but they are extremely alive in Englund's collection of small moments that are lost in details.
Many of them are about lack and helping themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes covered with wood. "
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says about the war: "One feels that despite everything that was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and pretending to mean such a façade of civilization and as if there was no barbarism behind his own strengthened and bewildered shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"If one refrains from the idea of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man hanged secretly. "
Other observations deal with the old Europe, which falls apart, and new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a tailor-made suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is frivolous behavior as well as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a prostitute with a venereal disease in order to escape the front line.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in trade with Gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to get into the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war unleashed "uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more distorted than Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a nonfiction book.
I won't give it to you anymore.
But it's like he grabbed this page with the main characters in front of us with his book and lit us with a match.
After an early misstep a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters a huge increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "last minute," said someone who is familiar with the orders, what a declaration as "exercise."
"The few policemen involved to my knowledge did not know that it was Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then withdrew when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including deployment commandos from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are normally deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people enter and go out in the park, almost like commuters, so that 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the smallest number of people is in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that roared from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials invaded the park in their light blue bushes, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 a.m. no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests become necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the Chief of Police, said that this had happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officials' dealings were very rough.
Mr Browne said that TV cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
As the police moved west through the great confusion of the protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleanse, which picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were bound together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
According to the police, the eviction was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests were, as he said, due to "unreasonable conduct and resistance to arrest. "
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of department of the detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "didn't "lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officers waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the perimeter further and further around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed that several officials, many of them with protective signs, were driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, because the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option still open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs in a chess move on October 7, described the union leader as a political revenge for the fact that last year the city had been denied access to a health fund that the working groups had entertained, with which the budget gap should be closed.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the dismissals were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council fired back and told him that nothing in the budget specified that school help workers would be dismissed.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will charge Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city did not have the lawsuit and thus the individual claims of the city could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in the poor districts of the city to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers as they are chronically underfunded.
She explained that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 helpers were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the discovery of the loss of five out of eight school helpers employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of benevolent parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo which authorized the dismissal of the mentoring coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" (transmit) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six mentoring coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft action.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee will adopt a resolution under the authority of Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praised Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "muteness."
"This resolution honours the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of two parties for their democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House were arguing about the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law was passed in the Senate. Furthermore, the Chamber overruled a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not furious enough to pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and " commends the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures receive full support from the Committee on Foreign Relations or will they divide the legislators, as the June Act did?
The last version comes up against the resistance of the senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional change calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congressional legislative period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area that is currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and encompass a wide range of issues.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others are slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners with the Republicans who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that Congress members can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids marriage among same-sex people is a recurring template, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to make it possible to repeal federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eagerly as members propose changes, they move as much faster as in previous years.
In the 111st Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments in the 110th Congress 66th Congress.
Compared to the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, the pace fades, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Failed, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man from the nearest distance shot at her during an election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20," she wrangled for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, which divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned to Congress surprisingly to cast triumphantly her voice on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the assassination in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "All right."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special, recorded shortly before the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The Special has been following Gifford's recovery since the assassination of January 8.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A twitch with your lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see how Congressmen sing together with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'."
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said that she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12, he read Gifford's article from a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly treated as a medical practitioner while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," told Gifford's Sawyer.
Hard, hard, hard.
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated," Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you're gonna get through this, and you're gonna recover, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines gathered around him for a cue.
The crowd in black tuxedoes stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer on the gala, who was watched by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it wasn't respect, it was pity.
The crazy contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if people were hurting her in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that struck the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and who, after his return, took over an elevated state post in Washington.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the Americans' lack of interest in the war.
Performance on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military confronts growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-attacking rape in the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Senior Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman wiped her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military workers are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. attorney, the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but they increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers' colleagues, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide appropriate jurisdiction according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically constructed," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The files of the court, which are available to Newsweek, set out in detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries caused by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the applicant's military service," the document states.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernised, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her fight: three more lawsuits besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies for the alleged promotion of an anti-women's atmosphere.
The non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America independently collects a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to release them from duty - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the administration of war veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Defense Department's Office for Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse), 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the reported cases in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole bunch of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, who was from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the contractions would start. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember when I came out, saying to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it to be disabled.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so that she does not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs filed is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion they should move forward. "
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I've been a critic of the Feres Doctrine all my life.
The military is lagging behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrent that comes with liability.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its course, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs in future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You On Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed his first public hearing in court during an amok run in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from being alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding place for personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to specify their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing extremist groups across Europe and then targeted them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their education, attitudes towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's quite a new method of research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online supporters of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes," text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook's "DataSupernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers named this page in the title by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this site people that you usually can't reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them to enter," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook all this falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their total rush on Facebook tend significantly more to drink problems than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-ranked students, for example residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you don't recognize it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly taps into the data of its own population.
The website's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National Glücksindex (mainly using information that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have known for a long time that the site should make its large data repository accessible to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to share your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was all about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of social issues - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two amok runs in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight of Norway's Templar," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not confess to guilt."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to address his victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he did not have access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind lock and lock.
All took part with the aim of closing everything down.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a little further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technology genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who was eager to make diagrams - a man who believed that many managers were suffering from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph der Fachidioten" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat together with jobs for more than an hour, in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialized idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing on delivery.
It was only after Job's death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: Das verlosene Interview," which comes to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor extensive interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely's questions and prompts him to respond more quickly to issues or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview seems somehow eerie far-sighted when jobs evaluate what other companies are doing right or wrong in their opinion and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous tributes to career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer on the move to grandeur is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline Apple's accounts.
Astounded by how costs were recorded - usually started with "standard costs," which were calculated on the basis of mere assumption and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest extent possible.
How the Pope was fooled:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box," which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could slip into the telephone company and conduct long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Job's enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, as they loop as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you bumped into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," Jobs says giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were doing as well as Henry Kissinger could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, they had to laugh before the Pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"This had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was as tall as a suitcase, had a small screen with a Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for her.
How to improve innovation:
Jobs talks several times in an interview about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember screaming arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large enterprises that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs anticipated the ways in which so many industrial giants, with their visions, stumbled into stumbles and lost control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They have the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's those people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position becomes necessary by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
This happened with Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You got defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it's about the taste, it's about trying to deal with the best stuff people have created, and then trying to put these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for the computer industry, they would do fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dining with opponents of health laws, as court takes case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divided question of whether to hear a contestation of President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which was decided by Congress last year, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists all over the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to stimulate the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once attorney general under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies supporting the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case at a Washington hotel.
Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican faction in the Senate, and a declared opponent of health reform, among other things, was on duty.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are freed from the code of conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charity events law of near and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in it were sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This astonishing break with morality and the opposition to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lying that the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US.
"The judges won and served at a charity event with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support for a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they are too easily mixed up with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was attorney-general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court at first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too engaged in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't want to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 two-way aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It's really a rare news that a company gets an order for over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the total list price for these 50 aircraft is at a record $18 trillion.
Just as unusual is the customer of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
On the weekend, Boeing announced its largest contract for commercial aircraft of all time, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show that the airline has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that will raise the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8 ordered, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock exchange specialist.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't only have the money to pay the planes, but rather an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural protection," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leading position in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep Airbus competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the predominance with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported opponents Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race around the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for Governor Muchoacan's office during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the governor's post in the western state.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our collaborators in the polls ... you have occupied election booths, built road blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had conducted the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came in third place, a serious defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug traffickers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have quit the local elections for fear.
For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory makes us look courageously into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that "dispassionately" look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leaders and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has experienced a severe debt crisis in recent months.
Over the past few days, Italy's interest costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would provide European partners with greater bargaining power in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a mission, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help rich Europeans when faced with major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell help to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, more than 800 million of whom live on a day of $2 or less.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public sector in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crises will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ now threatens "the risk of gradation" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to draw up "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta heated the congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticed weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a conclusion on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such a careless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unenforceable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would certainly have to leave civilians to reach the target."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were ultimately going to hit the fighting troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorist struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," warned Panetta.
"Staff recruitment has been reduced, which would lead to delays in recruitment and the recruitment supervision that support the war."
"Staff salaries would be reduced, leading to late payments to war traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators replied to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of seizure of the Ministry of Defence would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its intervention should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly made the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is faced with tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture of what might be ahead - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's a Luftwaffe squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you get angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta described new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global operational and intervention capabilities, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If we stopped the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers can be avoided by China and other opponents.
How to Discover a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lie are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is concerned with the allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides are lying to each other.
The management of Penn State is accused of perjury, as reports have allegedly been withheld that a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in campaign funding associated with cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who's seen it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they could stand well even during their performance checks.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or "discover lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharades, where it is the goal to call "Have yourself!" unmasking a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been unmasked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stammer, blush, and twitch.
From this one must not conclude, however, that these liars are difficult to uncover and to expose.
A skilled lie-deacon can penetrate the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, the questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of unmasking, and it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to cope in our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing persons or negotiations or administration are one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at judging other people, their interest and their own emotions, and they sense intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more often "self-centered" than women, whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less frequently than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person is exposed as a culprit, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing this person's normal behavior.
That's called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the later assessment of changes.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone usually gets his foot kicked all the time, so they don't blame him unjustly when he hits his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shine, not as evidence of unmasking.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the interview," this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that a job interview is over just to look for this relaxation after the job interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his wife was still alive and started a national search for her.
Deceptive persons can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, which often causes the alarm bells to shine.
There is no magic device to unmask lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to unmask them.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk of delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which made the unions angry and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to redesign the project so that one can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This happened after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was verified, which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, following the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was to connect Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are opposed to the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy says that the main auditor of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada is Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing a toddler out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had gotten a tantrum that scared her little daughter so much that she turned herself over to fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade scared Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "enhanced fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk took his luggage and Genevieve in her arms into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back in her arms," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't drop your daughter off near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started scolding - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to dump water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother, who still wore Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to throw up, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not reply to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for non-specific damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge any fee and that the family would plan to donate the money she gets to child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arms."
Climatic adversities slowed the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and fosters great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, as a result of the climatic difficulties, growth cannot be talked about, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter.This is mainly due to the historic decline in agricultural development of 31.16 percent, which had a brake on further economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity up to November has led to a steady rise in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid rise in unemployment in the first quarter, as between January and March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa that year is due to several factors. Economics scholar Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the politics of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts in funds from legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are forbidden to accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen, due on the one hand to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and are looking for work, which increases unemployment," he says.
Unfinished business
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of workers in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in FDI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $630,597, representing a decline of 87,74 percent compared to the $5,143,212 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) for its part, recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The State Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be detected by November.
Reactions
The first year of Mario López Valdé's government made it apparent to the representatives of the business community.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), argued that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It needs to be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we have to work twice. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slower.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
Re-define vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico Business Association) in Sinaloa, said that the government had to be encouraged to do more dynamic productive work.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and lineage, because it is important to activate all Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government's efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, and economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which we can say that the government has acted more broadly. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 daily sentences for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Procuratorate of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military in the surveillance of the Tripolio Valdez road opposite guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the offenders remain in the prison.
Debt on construction work
According to Miguel Ángel López Miranda, the social housing for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes is at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounts to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction work is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year has already come to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, so the community had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, equivalent to the amount that the central government would have had to raise.
"This had already happened to us in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not invested to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the public authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, has been requested to speed up the administrative work and to pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million of them have to contribute, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogue signals to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by virtue of which the switching of analogue signals to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he published the Legislative Decree detailing the switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
The project for the lawsuit prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the Decree-Law be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the Decree-Law would contradict the hierarchical principles and the legal provisions.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. Following the adoption of the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and stopped all activities to set up the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if we were to do so, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, which is responsible for government affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that have taken place around the world in recent years, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which had not only technical aspects, "because it embraces economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital changeover, through the government, although they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government intervened in the powers of Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislature would be respected," she assured.
The possibility to count the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the ballots is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data provided by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
To this end, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November, on 9 November, the electoral office had adopted a series of rules to harmonise local rules with federal reforms in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, electoral law or electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Scoreboard within the time limits provided for this with the argument that he had no objection.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action brought by the local legislature and assessed the voice of the State Commissioner on constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal," since he did not have the right to "decide or veto."
During an interview with María de los Ángeles Llanderal on the possibility of individual counting of votes, María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority could partially or completely count out the ballots.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not available in the file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of complete ballots may be counted if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from the party or coalition leader, who is the second of the candidates mentioned at the beginning of the meeting.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages suspended from partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral records have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés drove down this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the Show of the Dead and a Mass of the Dead took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force in the event of the accident. The closest persons to the colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock at noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed on the mourning hall, which is on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Technological Institute. This mortuary was initiated by his former classmates from the technical abitur and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes were scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said so to his family and his friends," announced Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought it was even giddy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always wanted to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he went to Zapopán to graduation his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A Last Farewell
The lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all honours under the direction of the governor Jorge Torres López. Her honour was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, school leaders and students of the Saltillo technological educational institution, where he studied in 1985 and was outstanding in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he flew crashed, in which also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority sat.
At 6.05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the forecourt of the barracks, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were waiting for him.
The abandoned corpse was found on a plot on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a shot of mercy in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the kilometer point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood wide open.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three metres further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, who was clothed with a white top.
The body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue pants was just a few meters away.
All three were lying on the belly.
According to the information received locally, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no bullet casings were found.
On the wall of the country house, there are inscriptions that one organized criminal gang writes to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) introduced 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a criminal gang mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the information given to the public, eight people were first arrested on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas."
On November 12th, at 6:00 p.m., soldiers found a car without license plates with two inmates in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret funerals in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that will face the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that will face the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
A message from the presidential palace announced that the Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by Europolitans in order to regain the damaged confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti's haste has been compounded by the fluctuating market situation, which has put Italian government bonds at 7 per cent interest for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confederation of Industry Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the full."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Centre-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats who are forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again cause a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also putting pressure on Monti to say that failure is a disaster.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The session is scheduled to be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breathing-up towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds has reached critical limits again.
To save Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout umbrella.
Monti said that his government had to last until the next elections expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, pointing to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure on financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the hump.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 recruits has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly game that takes place today at 3.05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While the World and European Championships, the number one on the FIFA monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A competitions, the three-colored team has only Defense Player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (liga and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Football Championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking list.
We will see the Spanish team pulling their last record: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (lose 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Today Casillas will play against the three-colored team and Spain will play a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle stormer of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol, with 97 games, is also approaching the number one hundred.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left siderunner Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five games were played on more than 30: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games are played in the Spanish team Gerard Pigé (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't even approaching the 20s border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar recorded only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive talk with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that a dream would come true for them when they played in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, the complete copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica for a vacation once. It's such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've done over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent places to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven't played in the repertoire for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might get forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years. It looks like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of Grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band comes out of a city, but it's unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still looking forward to being friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be still alive and, moreover, we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, which give every individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't get any better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come for the music, it reminds you that you have to watch the music and what it has brought into being, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built up the band with us. When I listen to a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and soccer and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why they chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks of.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
From so many+
The first to come up with me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I think we all do not feel very connected to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now it's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit frivolous, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me both when I heard Ed play them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly represent that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congressman and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he thought he was innocent.
He was operated four times on tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been detained at the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss regional policy issues.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the culmination of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the Uruguayan collective living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support for the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still exist as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most powerful emerging and industrialised countries in the world. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the practicalisation of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The purring installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month on the counters around the world, was tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which can be played three-dimensionally without a special glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, responsible for the Nintendo press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the very beginning," because so far successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesperson stressed that, although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less smart users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different playing levels, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects," it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks over the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The must-bearded installer has to overcome dangerously-picked platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom vouches for Portillo's extradition to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would stand for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to be responsible in the United States for the $70 million money laundering plot.
Thus, the trial of the US request for Portillo's extradition ends, so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not intervened in court decisions and had accepted all requests for extradition, which he was informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is being sued for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities have exhausted their powers to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be extradited if its legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign, which was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social assistance organisation Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter-century, 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than one hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a review was made yesterday at an event held in Fabra i Coats' former factory buildings, attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was established in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
At yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous leaders of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years took part.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during election times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city council member Ricard Goma took part in the celebrations.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and by Jaume Lanaspa, Director-General of the Social Fund of the Savings Bank of La Caixa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis."
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Busy house where huge parties were held was cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
All points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 have come to an end on the street Balmes.
Twelve people left the building, which they had illegally occupied yesterday at noon and organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair, and were evicted by a court order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"Access will be checked from now on," confirmed the house manager.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply with them. They had also painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also caused damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the beginning of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the resort had been reported by the neighbors because of a disturbance of rest, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there and which, according to the angry neighbors, have become more and more and longer in recent weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it had received more complaints from its neighbours in recent weeks.
Last week, the president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded that the building be cleared immediately and that the problems of civil coexistence and the coming down of the neighbourhood be dealt with.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in the last few months. In some cases even thefts had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the antisocial acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., the police approached Montral No. 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The urban call for tender for the 16 Gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its slander on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers to New York's Central Park.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, in the eyes of many, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few which does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the yogibear, no longer served as a role model for the Central Park.
So far it was when the city issued a huge invitation to tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's planning to score goals on the land.
The question is self-evident: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for proposals is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring topic, on which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can resort.
And this is exactly the fact that the material offers one of the rare similarities between what three Barcelona architects think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak about the "front on the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which was not carried out on the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should start from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be imagined "as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban development experience, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that involves "some dangers."
Risks arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space now entails" after the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "song of swans" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is to limit oneself to what may be cultivated.
"Limiting something always means setting the next step," i.e. crossing it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, says simplifies the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronage de Collserola, which should not be "on deaf ears," although he is grateful to the city council that it has given its body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment on."
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain range to the city is the guide letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "distant" as to whether this technical profile should guide the established multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as in the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: "There were 16 cross-section competitions," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
At least in his case, this led him to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length in such a way that a soft transition between the city and green areas arises.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the agent of Casino Red released the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent of Casino Red has awarded him a trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion before the Second Criminal Court of the District.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration can approve the secret operation of the betting house.
According to the lawsuit, the Procuratorate opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antigua of the capital.
At that place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the Ministerio Público's official had rejected the crimes of bribery and organised crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he only spent a few hours in the central security wing, as death threats were against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza Municipal Prison.
On October 25th, Jorge Yánez, Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, sent him a prison order, which found that after the almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to blame Jonás for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
This Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to give the mayor's brother the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing Ramiro Arias, the official of Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had repaired the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had pardoned him. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
According to case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken. No objections can be brought against the trial in the following case, and no compensation is required.
Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released after the hearing of the Commissioner of the House at around 3.50 p.m.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case was being filed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
The secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, gives details of the plane accident in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake, and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Mexico Communications and Transport Secretariat) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter, with its whole intact structure, was hit directly against the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at 25 metres altitude, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the field where the machine had come down.
"When searching, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a bevelling of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Mexico Secretariat for Aircraft and Assistance), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidencial at cruising speed and that the aircraft had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
During a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points which should be taken into account during the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the take-off. During the continuing flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds arose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds the crew had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or any deviation from the flight route prior to impact.
Disperse the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was bumped from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was bumped to the ground with its intact structure.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the scene of the accident do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest results indicate several soil contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a bevelling of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unbroken aircraft structure had bumped against the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
She heads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the IMSS sports grounds in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 am.
He stressed that the investigation began on the Cuauhtémoc sports field (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the Nezahualcóyolt sports field (in the east of the state of México) since October 8th.
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study is continued on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Day of Diabetes, he stated that it was intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years should fill out nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He also stated that on those Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was checked and blood values were determined such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the basis of the concern of health personnel about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years the proportion of obese boys has increased by 77 percent and that of obese girls by 47 percent. Overweight has also increased dramatically," emphasized the specialist at IMSS.
He claimed that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average of 65 percent of Mexicans is Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) that has been taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the investigators would be a comprehensive examination of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the incidence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors will explain all measurement results to parents and propose changes to the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, Researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM, develops modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs emanating from the road surface were to be taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City Area of the Valley of Mexico) erupted, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning and reassuring that if laying out and maintaining the asphalt surface were to be adequately done, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Technically-looking punchholes," which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which however has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together, they lend the road surface its characteristic tough elastic behavior.
Toughly elastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C it is almost firm, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The researcher at the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible road surfaces, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
Those who receive and distribute most of the forces of this road surface also require an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further important factors to consider, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets wet, water penetrates into the layer and is only difficult to recover, causing a softening of all layers of the road surface and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
When a pothole is formed," he said, "the top layer is removed first, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. However, the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico's National Research System) explained that the vehicle load was another important cause of the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without applying high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not having the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th misstitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winner's podium, to showcase a silver crown and the tape she shows as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 miss titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the proclaimed Misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many today ask themselves is: What was missing?
For the result is the decline of a great favourite who had shown at every demonstration that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected Queen of the Police and Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also been given to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?" that Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos had asked her.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I quite believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilise, in the end I believe that the book, which was the most important for my childhood, 'The Little Prince' is a rather deep book.
At the moment I am reading 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'passions'.
An answer that met with little love for one another, firstly because of the term 'civilize' and secondly because it had not explained in concrete terms how each of the books she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the favorite, which had all the coincidences and which had all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which the queen stressed, which therefore could not shine on stage."
And this was noticed at her first show in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation party.
Although she appeared safely with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition is not finally queen."
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty was assembled, they said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which she was noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on her stomach, which, frankly, was hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to get them done properly.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction emerged after the show in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the nomination of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali entered history when the man who identified "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a Lophoscopist from the CTI (Cali Procuratorate) investigation unit, who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Colombia's Revolutionary Armed Forces), arrived: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, Eliazar González was on duty this week, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialised in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of deployment against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who had run the oldest guerrilla in the world could be one. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the most examination, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media at all.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, had no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planter's cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the print sheet.
He had seen correctly: It was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for traces
For a Daktyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many of the offenders present false identification documents or they have none.
We'll take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that when he was stealing, he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Wands are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also relieve or burden suspects of murder.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
The investigation suspected that a family member might be a suspect, and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle was consistent.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopicist explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagent are taken from the object."
When they appear, a planter or ribbon is used for taking away.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was the same as it was shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all the gold that shines is not all you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "indignant" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday when they again tried to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after they had been evicted from the square at dawn and had tried to occupy another place on Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to gain access with a court order that allowed the "indignant" to camp again at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held to the eviction order and occupied a park further north of the city, where nine arrests took place.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray stated that the "indignant"'s response to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and allowing the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "indignants" occupied a new park at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give exact figures. He assured the Efe news agency that he had also seen several journalists handcuffed among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have arrived at this place, where also a delegation of religious leaders had arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, in which the legality of the eviction taking place at dawn is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried with them photocopies of this judicial order and distributed them. They even gave them to some policemen who guarded the square, resulting in "some minor clashes," as Bray reported, who had reported that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to evict members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws passed after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that this court order had lifted the reopening of the square for the public traffic and the demonstrators. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the early morning eviction of the Zuccotti Square, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "rejected the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evict the place because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other persons," because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents were "aggregated for their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press."
Occupy Wall Street officials informed that they were thinking about organizing "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organisations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary on the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," lifeguard in "Baywatch," rabbit at "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson will perform together with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV distributed images of the television program in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-twisted porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee - as a Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to represent Jesus.
The scene features Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" as a child of Jesus.
The Christmas programme of CTV not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian a "whore."
Japan Reborn after the Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of freefall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government's initial estimates in Tokyo estimated the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finalise this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the rate calculated for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can partly be explained by the sale of machines for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual reversal of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has woken up, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has committed itself to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - resorted to one of the "refugee currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the murky forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a tombstone on the accounts of export companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results to the Yen's listing from July to September.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the ongoing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very cheerful.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the biggest economic potentials would have slowed down.
Because it dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100, after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon in his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and in no way withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date of February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 employment promotion programmes, a reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not give up doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million Athens urgently needs, and he made it clear that he would not approve of a commitment to the implementation of the austerity measures.
But yesterday, the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreou referendum, reiterated its call not to be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties were not to sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section of EUR 8000 million," although there is no final date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance."
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for the whole of humanity based on human trust."
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of achieving the number of people living with income of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "poverty limit."
Spain "will continue to work" to expand the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it will carry out this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The micro-credit summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "two basic objectives."
The Queen stated that it was intended that 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would be above the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of micro-credit dates back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago," which Queen Sofia regards as an "act of justice and recognition."
She described the father of this financing instrument as a "wonderful idealist dedicated to fighting poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have been able to observe continuous development," the Queen explained, whose commitment to this project yesterday brought her the assessment as "Head of the Family" in Valladolid and as "Supper of the Poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and seek solutions to the struggle against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment."
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrialised countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of " marginalized" people "who are always standing in front of closed doors" to "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes that the EU President be elected on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who regard government policy as too lax with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow.
The European Commission's proposal for a presidency proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The Standing Ovation, which lasted several minutes, which was initially held by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention, did not leave any doubt on the part of the three European Finance Ministers.
The main idea of the chancellor, as well as the proposals, has the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be reflected by a revision of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the European Union's control over the eurozone's budgetary policies, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting "to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's godfather.
Certainly it is unlikely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Likewise, the delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country on the ECB Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously lead to an increase in Germany's position.
The chancellor, concerned with calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
In so far as the European request dedicates a paragraph to the significance of "German-French friendship," Angela Merkel does not call France on the agenda.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the scam represent when sick?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now tackling the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and present a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy in a test of hardship, but on the other hand is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is targeting the introduction of a fourth day of waiting before a sick leave is taken into account in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily "Les Echos," threatens to provoke anger, but would help to contribute 280 million euros.
And that would be accompanied by another measure of a rather symbolic character: to grant the state officials an unpaid waiting day in the event of illness (there is no waiting period for them, in contrast to the three waiting days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also rekindles the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence of work.
"Checks will be much more important, and they will also be reimbursed if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13, in front of the RTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of disease reporting seems somewhat unproportioned.
Indeed, since 2002 this has been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer more ill than people in other places in Europe.
However, let us first look at the national figures.
According to CNAM, in 2006, more than 237 million euros were paid out on a daily basis.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of the health care sector, daily compensation amounted to EUR 11.3 billion in 2008, representing 5% of health expenditure.
This figure included 46% in terms of maternity leave, accidents at work and 54% in terms of sick leave, i.e. €6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, only 14.5 days of sick leave were granted to the French in 2010 compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that covered up certain differences: another one, published in 2007 by Monster.com, Website for Career Planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of sick leave in 2010 was shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers tend to have no more incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (caused by illness or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the reporting of sick people is a negligible proportion in terms of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak measure is achieved.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic checks on sick people who exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public University of Education and Training of Technicians and Engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 completed, short-term medical reports, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were unjustified or too long.
In the systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days of sick leave, there were less than 1.2 million 11% of "unadapted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
Thus, in total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases occur in several million workers who have filed a complaint.
A figure that represents only a weak measure compared to, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a substantive report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of day-to-day allowances, and thus considerably more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This was announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new programme for budget adjustment," said the head of government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro summit on 27 October was the "main task' of the new government, as the country's involvement within the eurozone would be "at stake', as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit by 9% of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights reject the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his approval on Monday to the measures already approved with regard to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent ahead that his party would not be prepared for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentary assembly of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties to support the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word would be enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanying suicide must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain relief treatment to provide the best pain relief remedies, including beyond cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually engage in talking to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, interlinked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia, where this choice arises, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada has ranked 10th in this respect, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of the Canadians to die at home, however, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate is highest at 86% of deaths in the Quebec hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are directed against the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to make any amendments to the penal law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or the accompanying suicide of uncompetent or non-accepting persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such violations, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompanying suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Let us bear in mind that according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that they would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia does not lead to the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to the persons who have already practised a accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that these should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or cessation of drugs in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of the means for which a legally valid refusal had been made should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect the end-of-life withdrawal, without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain relief treatment to provide the best pain relief remedies, including beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to the means of pain relief or life-long measures already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions, the panel calls for them to be considered at least, as they did not serve to reduce physical pain and relate to the same procedures as euthanasia.
Other experts' reservations
Some health professionals have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extreme," among other things, since they set no limits to euthanasia practice in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age is asking another person to help him commit suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had looked through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's responsibility over all the other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "strong opposition' to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto'.
Margaret Somerville, who himself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular questions the reports on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denounces a "complot'
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the authorities of the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, thanks to the support of Russia, resists it and rejects a "combat" directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria's expulsion by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbouring countries, had taken a position in favor of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the current Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his authority in Syria," in which about forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar cared about his country's interest, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation efforts directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and are unable to satisfy them must go," he explained in allusion to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey takes a steadily roughening attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed "the strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have become increasingly acute in the face of repression in Syria," Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department, observes.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region in southern Syria died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in "shoot changes and heavy bombings for Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country was "taxing towards the end of the crisis."
He has, by the way, reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not give in," he added, under the assurance that "the conspiracies forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French foreign trade minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which, according to him, encapsulates itself in his "Paranoia."
An extraordinary reunion of the League is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the exit of the crisis adopted on 2 November, in particular the controversial, probable withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrect' to avoid the support of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls for the markets to be patient and for Italy to be prepared to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that calls for "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a hearing with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, composed of relatively strict external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, for his part, had to wait for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of cancellations, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, saying that "the markets are sure to be dull and understanding."
His appointment by the president was welcomed by the markets in the beginning, but the unrest had intensified, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister-in-Office should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians."
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has committed itself to working urgently in the spirit of the goal of making Italy the "renewed protagonist" in Europe since it took up its role.
A spokesperson of Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change, even taking account of the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new measures of hardship.
Emma Marcegaglia', chief of Italians, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need to boost the economy', because a country that has no growth at all cannot respect the deficit indicators'.
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epoch change" in Italy after 17 years"Berlusconism"; the"Professor" symbolizes the"Challenge of Trustworthiness" and "another Italy," according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to pay 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iranian Nuclear Energy Programme
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that could be used with a nuclear weapon, a US NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Safety (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency for the investigation of this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA announced its "serious concern" on the occasion of an"possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for more than three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
He is said to have left the centre in 1989 or 1991 to set up a company in Kiev that produces "nano-diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that Iranian development of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only very skilled in this technology, but also, as one member of the State informed the Agency, had worked his entire professional career through this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either slightly decreased or only slightly increased over the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in the number of crimes directed against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes was recorded.
According to the FBI, the total number of "hate-motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak measure, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed."The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," Paul Legendre, one of the organization's leaders, added.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, with the view that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards the "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" represents itself in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after Martin Luther King's death in order to punish acts of violence against race, skin colour, religion or descent and now also involves crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter Microblogging website introduced changes to the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which once again makes the service similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activities" tab and another "Name" allow for a better readable live view of the activities of other "Twitterers," the Internet users, their messages ("tweets") and their messages to be tracked and tracked.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track their messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users," Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner stated in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with somewhat esotherically seeming wording (RT for the referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un manipulation plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation through certain "tweets' via the Internet.
"That's useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule' in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the large Social Democratic/Christian-Democratic coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid any possible degradation on the part of rating agencies in Austria's top bonus (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, that is, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency hadn't fallen from AAA to AA+ at one stroke, we would have to pay three billion euros of additional interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister.
Austria is also calling for the Brussels Summit of the Eurozone Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government would then have requested the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model' since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule' in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), and by 2017, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while the regional states, as well as the municipalities, should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the yen continues to rise, Japanese official power would intervene again on the currency markets.
"If we find excessive volatility in the Yen's exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again approaching the historical levels that had forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is about to set a new record against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by purchases from investors who see the yen as a "refugee value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese motto harms the exports of the archipelago, since it increases the cost of "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, since they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast) on 11 March," emphasizes M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the Yen could already kill the weak upswing in the bud.
With the growth in the third quarter of the year, the third world economy has regained its momentum for the first time this year - -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - thanks to the surge in exports and the consumption of households "polomed" by the catastrophe.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the Yen's inflation does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan."
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, for his part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday, to take all imaginable measures to soften the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, however, has informed that the BoJ has already taken "appropriate measures' to announce that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to redeem the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover that it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate feet fast in height, stock exchanges make retreaters
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis constantly undermines the European figures.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little more into negative areas this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions with regard to government bond yields in the eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets continue to issue some of their recent gains.
"Capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is on a limited range of variations as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the eurozone damages the single currency, which continues its ban on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10 a.m., the European value of the Valuta was 1.3570 Doller, so it declined by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, had accepted a request which in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to withdraw from the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's lending rates remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% on 10 years, and that of Spanish titles reached 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investor fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the implementation of the Eurozone decisions taken on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections are taking place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
Expected growth figures of the eurozone
Statistically, France recorded 0.4% growth in the third quarter, driven by household consumption, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany had revised the figures for the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection of the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning against the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing ahead with a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, so that an enormous proportion of the world's population does not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to live isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just planning to build only last generation nuclear power plants.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided to annex another unit to its park after Fukushima by re-establishing the Three Mile Island plant after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which focuses on renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as a model, reality contradicts discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, especially on Russia, due to the increased use of imported gas, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for thought.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European leader in wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy, and, on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a stability stake for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in energy prices, which made the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
Should France decide to withdraw from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electrician would hire an EPR designed to work for sixty years if the decline of his producer was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is just as little a work of devils as there is a miracle means of generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy developed by Areva demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority which carries out uncompromising and transparent controls at existing plants, such as at the construction site in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are now obsessed with the idea of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, so it ran without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was provoked by reactor construction and inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the same lessons from this accident as it did after the previous two.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that allows it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a stop to construction in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is imperative and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy subject to the numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students from the authorities had shaped the weekly shows, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "has no need for talents, masons or waiters from abroad."
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right, Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for one country," was quoted on the left by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "could not absorb the entire poverty of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both the right and the left.
From both camps the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to banalities that point to partnership development allowing our "migration problems" to be solved.
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent work that summarizes the latest insights into immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the domestic labour force, in particular the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than domestic wage-earners, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are untroubled in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage-earners, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthetists, so this complementarity also results in a positive effect of immigration on wages and the domestic labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants resulted in an included, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas created by immigrants is beneficial to economic growth (high proportion of naturalised immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to welfare systems, in the European countries on average about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that an immigrant at the age of 30 to Germany will, on average, contribute a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to achieve the missing intersections "with his teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remind itself of those who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco's in Spain, Salazar's in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy once and for all prevail over its enemies.
Since Napoleon "the little one" it has been known that it was a characteristic of the attitude.
The universal right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can become just as well a "suppression instrument," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public mind, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, and justice.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
In this respect, the change of attitude of the Greek Truth-False referendum would have had a double enlightening character: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their insubordination.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised according to the needs and in the wrong order.
An exemption for the European sole ruler or a leap with blindfolded eyes into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, in full justice, clarified and constantly, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know where to end the list, by the way - because there is only one crisis, and it exists in Europe.
It is all Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it every single one of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the people's sovereignty.
It is important that Europeans should be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has made decisions at European level a condition which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy without certainly bringing us to ruin.
This proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought over for a long time, and today everyone is pushing for European economic governance.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it envisions the citizens - would be another foolishness and another dead end.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We must form a more integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe in political terms, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become common goods
The world fair for chip cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase even further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment, after it has long lags behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards to their customers in the future, which are equipped with contactless chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by cell phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A negligible percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They have fallen behind."
"But they should experience a real upward trend at least next year."
"We expect sales of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking an initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also declared yesterday to prepare for the launch of an offer that allows their customers contactless payment by cell phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "achieved certainty."
"The way in which both organizations operate and the relations of the intelligence services point to clear cooperation," he explained without going further into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has revealed interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips in the debris at the site that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time had stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's conceivable, though."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo softens.
In recent months, these "support services' have become more and more obvious in their course, as well as Boko Harem's speeches and operating modes, which now indicate the addition of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has since then put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact for a long time regarded the grouping as a community of Illuminati, which should not be given special attention.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a disgrace" in Haoussa - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is very successful.
It politicizes itself and demands strict observance of Sharia, while the activists associated with it fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the Commissariat.
However, Abuja's reaction is indifferent as usual.
The army surrounds the city, and 800 people are killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, imprisoned, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination attempt in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram will be blamed for a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations' local headquarters became the primary international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been worrying all security experts ever since.
While the Aqmi occupied Mali and Niger operating Somalis from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, on the occasion of a discussion with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and showed his willingness to "tell all the clues."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-ridden America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, the voters could almost get that impression.
For several days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrades have repeatedly announced their thundering statements and statements regarding foreign policy, the traditional Republican focus.
Slogans about China, Iran and Israel's aid are often not supported in any way.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party," Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is irritated by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
Stupidly, if this is to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost lost his breath with regard to his emotional behavior.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Image
Romney had also praised military beatings against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I am elected, I stop Iran," he sounded.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of being guilty of obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-placed candidate, in turn shows a shameful ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered, as Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military beatings against Iran, for his part, is ready to put the American army in service in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama's 2009 ban on resorting to torture against suspected terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an außenpolitik heavyweight.
The current Presidential contrasts countered that Reagan had also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, as far as the subject of anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his"boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so casual.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive record of National Security under Obama, which Bin Laden has eliminated.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the bottom of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendour and glory.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level last Tuesday under orchestral sound and at the gourmet buffet.
German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically jointly turned the valve's steering system, which transports the Russian gas into the West European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And one already lets the eventuality of the construction of a third line sound on its own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
Indeed, the Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any route route by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, did not hesitate to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Asian pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically very sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of defusing European energy, as the project has broken the gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years Russia has managed to achieve its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are running out.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which it is intended to protect from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, about 200 m deep.
During their construction, minefields dated from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"Hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, Spokesman of Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The cable is a long line of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the Swedish coast, but the project managers have refrained from it, as the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company permanently located at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas outlet in less than a minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered to be unlikely by the designers, as the weld seams were estimated to have a leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled from a seaship for external observation purposes and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, a diameter of one metre, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides on arrival the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the quantity of gas transported is," Jens Müller specified.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are certain to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline appears on a sandy, pine-forested stretch of coast near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 metre high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular cover, its elastic band, the egg-scarf sides, aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook on the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by a traditional production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton bag used for covering upholstery benches, for example.
This kind of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and were established with a sales volume of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs more than 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the Zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of the e-mails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine profited from its success and cultural zeitgeist and managed to diversify its products: bags, appointment calendars, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such high levels?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No, that's what Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association Adapt, emphasizes, which hosts the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, much remains to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles continue to exist for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher level of education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% for the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it more difficult to re-enter the labour market and which "make the core of the problem," says Christian Gramin, Director General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992, which helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the physical brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes that, although certain, are slowly evolving.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for La Cité magazine stated that the managers interviewed had "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled" that was "over-represented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually impaired."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, which date back to 2008, refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, General Director of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof: The number of "fees paid" establishments, as well as the sum of the paid-up amounts, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increased contributions, created a lot of pressure on the companies, Pierre Blanc explained."
"But this improvement also reflects real knowledge, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the sites employ disabled workers between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Even before they faced the Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure, which brought them the friendly game.
It would be too far-fetched to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator podium of the Stade de France, George Lekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to make peace well and willingly.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had won nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures him.
As for the contrast between his presentation in Klub and Nationallf, "It is a unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought about Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France, to finally "glossy."
Without, however, refraining from the note of "pleasing."
He has been cheering the French national team since the age of 7, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily helps to reinforce the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just ran over the way."
"To be allowed to play against them means great luck!"
Lekens, for his part, sounded "pride" with kindness.
"The pride of a gala match."
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbour" - that France" has again become a very high-level team," and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he emphasized.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the match, both teams had missed the materiality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao," his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, in fact, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and to dump an opponent, Bosnia.
Considering the game (0-0) on Friday in Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice haven't fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to impose on it the important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are going to beat up in front of an audience that is just as hot on the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close," said the optimistic, but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to participate in the 2012 European Championship," but the successor of Carlos Queiroz was relativized.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved an away goal," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order to "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
