Barack Obama Receives Nobel Peace Prize as Fourth US President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth President of the United States in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a cheque of 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the north-urban metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidents then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He receives the award as the fourth US President, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already said that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when the prize is accepted.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgets to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Gol Medal, the diploma and the cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (approx. 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, where besides Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the beginning.
For example, he pointed out that he felt that he didn't deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was "an invitation to act" for him.
Naturalists accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals last year against some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded from the investors money in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokesperson, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's in prison for up to three years.
The sorting bulk containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the sorting containers again and again.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in Brno wouldn't work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors do not take sufficient care of this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers here, but above all because of the number of trash cans for such waste.
At some point in the center, did they try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collecting basket, for example?
It's art, it takes time and a lot of nerves.
The only place I've found so far by chance is Moravia Square opposite the hit goose.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be offended, but that seems to me far too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not a honey leak in other parts.
Therefore, whole rows of my friends prefer not to sort the garbage at all.
Out of laziness.
Because it's too far from the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles myself after the party.
But on Konicova Street I didn't see any tins of paint in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was driving a tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that disgraces us all over the Republic instead of buying a few trash cans more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of southern Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, the budget no longer contains money for pensions, sickness benefits and construction savings.
But also not for the state debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This causes them even more problems that will be in the government in the second half of next year, says the finance minister, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or sickness benefits in addition. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mine laying," says Janota.
Credits pay higher and higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now given more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
To get the pensions or the sickness allowance, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, in the state treasury, not only 163 billion will be missing, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will rise faster and faster, and along with this also costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then the VAT will no longer be sufficient to increase only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government made in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the transfer of money to some electoral groups, five billion will be missing next year for the development of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections won in the competition that can no longer be redesigned and possibly reduced.
Most of all receive, which is also not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, the European money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it triggers the outflow of money in salomon - it attacks the CEZ stock dividend, where the state is the owner of the majority, and then distributes the money into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ invested 18 billion in the budget.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay the environmental damage liquidations, to replenish the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, the actual budget deficit increases to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP according to EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the upheavals.
Almost three billion went down the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not safe.
It's just gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money internally or in the worst case attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two-billion-dollar project "Staatskassen," which is intended to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would come in this case, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It's enough to just press one button, and Windows Mobile will change Android within seconds.
This is precisely the opportunity the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to execute two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware hinted at during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the smartphone test sample with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which simultaneously the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working together with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to come to the customer within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneelose slopes worry not only the Krkonoše inhabitants.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore you can still get free rooms in Krkonoše Mountains for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but meanwhile they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud," the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, quoted.
If you want the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers saving and where the quality of the stay comes in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindlermühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to sell it for a while, but then they'll have to give in and go back to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
In our offer about half of the seats is still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, stated the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year's Eve in Krkonoše Mountains, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec-Hotel, Karel Rada.
The Omnia Hotel is also occupied by 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays at the Central Parking in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
Pleasantly surprised us this year in January, for which we are currently already about 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker is now February, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Krkonoše Mountains is certainly increasing, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, quoted.
The Krkonoše hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow shear.
On Thursday it should cool off and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But then another warming is to come, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Smartness
It's almost weird, with which student commitment Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy on the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off three years ago via the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way forward" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea - to send out fresh contingents of troops into Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war - as "an irresponsible and in its conclusions, a carastrophic decision."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which was based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful one to the extent that the news about Iraq no longer speaks at all today.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, for objectively he left behind his successor a much more grateful starting point than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, once again asked him to increase the troop contingent, who even despite the subordination habits, severely criticized the twattering shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but didn't come up with a better idea, and so he cheated on the general of whom 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the promise for a further 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
His plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years is highly problematic in the whole Obama strategy. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fratricidal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by contraindications - no one can rely on them and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only fake buildings behind which patriarchal root relationships will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the confusion of the conditions which further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
Building a "active state," which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy puzzled by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is on the verge of explosion.
Believing that the small soldiers who broke out into the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul, which cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters the way in which the security of Germany or Italy is connected with the war in the Hindu Kush Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question arises for the United States as to whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered in the period during which America moves to Obama for the winner's withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left before the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy, fallls would turn out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs Managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
The company has announced this, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers get shares instead of money, but they can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to the agency Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street's bonus bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the broader direction in which it has to go, the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, quoted.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she set aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses in the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the action announced today, according to the agency Reuters.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the banker's bonuses, which exceed £25,000, once with a tax of 50 percent.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm, from the hands of the King of Sweden, Carl XVI. Gustaf, have taken over this year's Nobel Prizes in the specialist categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosones.
The Prize for Chemistry was awarded to Ada Jonath from Israel together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only subject category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have won this prize for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of the purchase of the money price.
This is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American president, Barak Obama, received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and is also at the head of the country that is leading two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps the remaining Janota in the cabinet, will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis in public finances.
The president spokesperson Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in his position on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which is now being signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party's proposals for money circulation and increased the money for state officials' salaries, for maintaining farmers' social benefits and direct wages.
The government has resisted the proposals of social democracy that they cover up the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the Right Party on the other, a sharp domestic political dispute arose, because of which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer-Beamtenkabinett, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the fishermen's government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, should end the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the State Budget Act but does not have to, today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that constitutes "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution anymore.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS Chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget was horrible and that the government should weigh up its further existence.
The ODS vice-president, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial board as "strong pronouncements. "
The CSSD boss, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that it exceeded 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: The Unbeaten" in the world shows much of the country, of whose struggle and victories despite some criticism that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby," already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which in the end he became a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty," but only rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activities in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten," and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, in order to unite the country. New President Mandela knows that his people are still divided by race and economy even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders around the world.
Finally, the South African team climbs up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role so as to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I've found that if I shake your hand, I'll take over your energy, it'll be transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important to me to have become another person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players overwhelmed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his analysis in the following words: "That was very good story, very well done film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was not successful again and the rocket, known as the "Bulava" type, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and of the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test did not have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started or damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers already write about "bulava" as a "rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly, but shines
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
Technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donsky, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an undetermined flying object over northern paths was actually the damaged "bulava."
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generality has kept itself against it this time and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage were damaged.
Even if no test start was made without errors, the head of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and so it is still claimed that the "bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
At the age of 51, legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov presented himself in a professional ice hockey game.
The former World Champion, Olympic Champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to compete against Petersburg in Friday's Duel KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, led fellow player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back on the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was able to win 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Dress of the Soviet Union he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championships and he has also triumphed in Canada Cup and in the Junior World Championship.

Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice Automotive Factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
The union announced its readiness to strike on Monday because of often ordered overtime.
Petr Vanek, spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory, confirmed this.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our work plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take replacement leave on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek stated.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Considering that overtime was the most urgent and burning issue in terms of demands and complaints from trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk stated.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 hours of overtime almost every day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
From the signing of the agreement, the willingness of the trade unions to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are expected to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on fulfilling the demands and sign a joint document, they would be willing to cancel their willingness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory got worse last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of permanent overtime.
They also protested against the bad terms of payment and alleged harassment.
The management held that employees had to make overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The unionists also demanded that the workers who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be subject to any sanctions in their on-the- Monday strike call.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions call for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are calling for the payment of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Series production started at the company in November last year.
By this September about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'stuffed' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not work as strongly on common virus variants as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the combination of medications can prolong life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral proliferation also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no medicinal products are effective anymore.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University of Prague) and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to how to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances known as metalocarboranes act on the protein substance responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block viral reproduction in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus spread caused by HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would be created.
When we eliminate HIV protease, we also eliminate the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed further.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances on HIV protease has been tested in the test tube, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of the metacarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as on the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the used medicinal products are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formation, makes the Metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS went on fishing, he fights back.
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "grey" and the Prime Minister's government of Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its future existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS statement as "strong pronouncements."
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The Deputy ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the left-wing Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with amendments to the Left Party over more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has resisted the proposals of social democracy that they cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the modified budget is also only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has talked about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in case the amendments were accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota registered with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had implemented the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government to what extent Fischer is in favour of the further struggle with the budget deficit.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the service bill amendment.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is a matter for the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek pointed out in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, there are people in a deputy position who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides not to fight the deficit-height of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in Parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and if that's going to be the case, then I'm going to deal with it, the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Mr Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon to attend the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the revised budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MEPs to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, and he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back during the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Already when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevisation of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway) fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will terminate or restrict some less-exploited express trains and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer fare are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, and the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less express trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, and in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The railway is planning the largest reduction in the Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, whereas Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and a few days a week the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change routes in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the suburban transport system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connections SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel within two hours.
Passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava with the Pendolino since 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, with a total of four billion crowns to pay for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, as was the case this year. Local trains supply the districts, with a total of eight billion crowns to pay for it next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, the regional trains are more expensive than 200 million Czech crowns.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railways praised the system, and perhaps that is why they have not resorted to price increases in the vast majority of tickets.
Changes only occur with one-day tickets CD Net and with cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitants today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This is what the agency AFP led, which originally only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostage.
According to the AFP agency, the Millitants are part of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) weaponry.
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed on account of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which involved the election to the governorate, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao Muslim separatists are also active.
Those who, however, resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will come to American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten," which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been preserved by Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public become loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize, in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time the media are shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the occupation of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
In his own words, Morgan Freeman is still proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can use this movie to shed light on Mandela's personality and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the Role of the Enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two racial and ethnic groups that have been separated from each other for year and day, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in the South African National Rugbydress on the World Cup field, which was won by South Africa at that time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred action in South Africa, Mandela learned great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be able to unite people into a single nation, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only become apparent.
The white South Africans are skeptical, however, as revealed in recent interview for LN the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing substances.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the management system according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandottova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be calculated after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new transformer according to the mandate.
For more than 10 years nothing similar has happened to Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, added it.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as sole operator of the line system, the electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, which transmits the electrical energy into the distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura filed a lawsuit for libel against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed a lawsuit for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Moravia district, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice district and the head of the Olomouc district, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's effort to operate regional trains in some districts.
All regions, however, eventually signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, but we only submitted the offer about the extent as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were closed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the prosecution to be the continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railways and did not offer tenders for the contract at a height of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was also threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn't give up that we could also lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Free and voluntary vaccination against pneumococci
Infection against pneumococci changes the habit from January onwards.
It is said to be the first free and voluntary for families.
But already now there are voices that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The medical institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
Children can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge from January, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccination dose.
Those who have started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further vaccination.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of the child's life.
Already last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that the health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year on the doses of the vaccine.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children up to 10 years of age in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, head of the Nahlas Citizens' Association, mentioned that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association already promotes long-term pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to achieve at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky pointed out.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, Chairman of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think about reducing the number of re-inoculations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochova, however.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococci from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first surface vaccination to be paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, saving them for further treatment, says Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same route as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some MEPs feared, however, that the insurance companies would be able to "lead the money out of health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars of paintings from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught with a trailer while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta Senior denied having granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "lost" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap of public wage settlements for 2011.
Social Security Announcers
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned against imminent "problems."
The rise in social security - to about GBP 3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although attention should be paid to the economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
FOCUS OF THE PRE-AB ETAT REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small businesses discarded
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
2.5% increase in public pensions
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 a year poorer and someone with £40,000 a year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 a year will be richer by £110.
Ministers said that their target of deficit halving by 2013 meant "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be borne by 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending stops were "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big figures. They will bring us the deficit hization and this is also absolutely necessary over the period of the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions of future economic growth - affecting the level of new debt and the rapidity of deficit write-off - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while debt would be 3 billion pounds sterling higher than previously estimated.
Missed Opportunity
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against Labour's "debt crisis," said that the planned debt of £789 billion over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how they will repay this and press "cynic" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place in June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything important about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit reduction coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and spending stops is being used to cover the spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand."
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above-mentioned inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April - the Chancellor of the Treasury would expose the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Holly Budget"
Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come into effect in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Treasury would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the transport, higher education, science and defence sectors in the future.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his head Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant at the auditing firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary budget report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates US citizen arrests in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens for suspected extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said they were investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of State said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"Of course, if they are American citizens, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," spokesperson Ian Kelly said.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misuse" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report detailed "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Public authorities said that such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens were given prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Penal Court.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, told Amnesty.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's reaction to it, but Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park ski slope was set up
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition piste.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added: "There are some of the country's best skiers and snowboarders here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a construction ban on minarette and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most declared secularised societies - and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and heavily arguing study of an issue that divided and occupied the country over a decade and a half, and whose effects can still be felt today.
Bowen's latest book offers a wider and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it, "Islamic freedom."
He is a good listener, he gives back debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seemingly profane matters, he claims, make up everyday life, in contrast to the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom have a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen questioned are usually divided with their Salafi counterparts - advocates of purist Sunni Islam, which is connected with Saudi Arabia - which nowadays show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who are so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes more of a "sharpening of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most desolate view
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts with alarming speed and takes with it life that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") draws a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Empired in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the lake, who fought only with the rifle butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the life of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore became quite green from the algae growing in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the shooting continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to track down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alu Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist," offers a clear and disturbing description of the Arctic science and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientist nor oceanographer can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time revealed the turbulence of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines were the shifting crate of sinking.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater troughs compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, everyone is threatened when the summer ice once passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... that could be us"
Marine infantrymen were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
Chief Private De'Angelo Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, wherever we're brought back from, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the mourning wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in different cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (Countries all over America), which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves in the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this is her way of giving back something to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as their goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, so the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held their hands, while they carried the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the grim mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends clinged to each other in the icy air.
Some read loudly the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white square cards that had been put for those in the damp mud whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the burial site of naval infantry sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been here for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the U.S. government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the United States Interest Office in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5th.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "risk."
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tensions between the Castro Brother Communist Government in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy attaches great importance to the United States' return when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to purchase a mobile phone since this year, which is mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson for the U.S. Interest Office in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch," which recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba," an allusion to the appointment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and detained within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards each other for more willingness to engage in dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had commented on terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service who was informed of the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to invade the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of an undercover operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and are being interviewed by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as doorkeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special test by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be enormously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years as to who they allow access, as the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded more bold action on climate protection from the negotiators in the city's Bella Congress Centre.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more likely to be about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosive devices near some government buildings in the city centre.
One day, when little happened at the UN-funded climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners saying "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Enough."
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels to Peru, her mother's country of birth, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to deal with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the motivation why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way around it anymore.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a viewer who didn't want to be mentioned because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked black-clothed demonstrators lit several explosive devices near the main Copenhagen canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, and added that they started as flares, but then were followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon long.
But the protest did not seem to have reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what is happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show persistent race gap
The testimonies of mathematics performance last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although Washington District is still far behind the country's high-performance schools, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighth graders have made progress in the past two years faster than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
However, what is included in the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures is the persistent gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white fourth grader from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their Afro-American peers rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not more encouraging either.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was captured in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown in this period of time, the difference with now 58 points has hardly diminished.
Some of the district's supporters of education expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely promoted by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equal education in Washington D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in fourth grade Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the exam score is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What frightens me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy that we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performing students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper and middle classes, which basic reading skills have not mastered at the beginning of their school careers and which are significantly behind their peers of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games from kindergarten to sixth grade and lifelike experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to ensure that the best measures are taken to benefit students below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide additional money and resources for the low-performing schools that are not needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examines urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could create political repercussions that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in Washington, in order to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to almost 200 days in order to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he regards as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The coach reaches the Gettysburg-College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group who are exploring Gettysburg, where the tuition costs $38,690 per year, was more of an awesome visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she was told the low professor-to-student relationship of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the intended message completely: The question is not whether one goes to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrant children born in the United States who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is needed to get into the middle class.
In truth, one in five of these "second generation" of Hispano-Americans completes college - which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the US without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they are pointing the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who examine powerful children say that these often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then at some point a single measure will not solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who investigated Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - A gear up - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom went to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to re-establish its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 agreements concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies were only able to take shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and Europeans are giving way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, have probably prevented American oil companies from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves.
US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been sidelined with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil ministry spokesman, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its competitors and will fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
For the bid levy preselected companies issued bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, reports US counter-terrorism representatives on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were said to have been killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism reported undetermined evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, pointing to the delicate character of the US air raids on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and converted them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali quickly rose up in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained the best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, who have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, reported the site.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN's leading envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, ending a stormy term clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide's departure took place when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is due to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of the Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN
Mr Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the Council, is now moving forward so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said was that he'd better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started searching for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
oaths rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership should allow his successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could hire only one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran Must Expect Additional Sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in discussions on his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good choices, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, the unpredictability of war itself."
The Obama administration is considering a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will have to expect "believable" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume talks on the limitation of its nuclear programme and would renounce a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees about whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran simply left the international community with regard to some of the proposals that they had already agreed to at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "expressing sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations condemned what it called "fundamental and unfounded claims" by some members of the Security Council on Iranian nuclear activities on Thursday and said that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in US plans to reduce American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change in Course in Ancient China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There's nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a personnel manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fattened, spoiled single children lovingly called "little emperors," a population crisis in the country is rising.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
Department of Population Affairs, while the number of the population aged 60 and over is expected to increase from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal towns with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and elderly people accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and alleviate the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A Gradual Relaxation
Anchored in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial instrument introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must expect enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese state officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policies.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policies.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many hard slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University's Institute of Population Research, said that government officials have even discussed more radical changes recently, such as allowing couples to have two children with an individual partner.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to pass through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town in Shanghai's outskirts said that there was an upsurge in requests from couples who wanted a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts did not report any change.
For the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still received per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that they would also be legally allowed to do so.
But, like many Chinese, they have only a minor health and life insurance policy of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child politics as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, we're being robbed of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said that she only wanted a child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it's about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20 to 39-year-olds grew up seeing their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on parents' time.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the room question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group designs emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild poses and mutual accusations -- once again focused on Friday with the publication of a document that will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialised nations having to shoulder the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that runs out of time, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the money supply that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialised and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policy makers would support.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the big deal."
It shows the outline of a possible agreement whereby industrialised nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its commitment to provide US$3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the conversations last week.
American climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not financed by the industrialised nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is going on a harder line with China, not even two years ago, as a representative of the Bush administration.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his statement one hour after the statement by Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or that it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
By putting the future economic direction of the great world powers at stake, breaking lines have emerged both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States acting on their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting to bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone over to more aggressive action to hold very high greenhouse gas emissions countries accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic domination will develop, says Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will, at best, lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states exerts "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the government leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, got off their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meet behind closed doors and press conferences to pinpoint claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The mere extent of the meeting -- 13,000 people go into and out at the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists stage nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and contract designs are passed on hand-to-hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Politics of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines the feeling of Monday
Monday morning at 5:13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent to London St. Pancras and will travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect to an international rail network with fast, reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuting cities, working hours would be radically reduced and the change of aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and concerns about environmental damage, could still put the brakes on British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to present a feasibility study to the government, says Lord Adonis will present the report on December 30th.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass by urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a five-metre margin.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another would head northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today slightly over an hour.
The drafts would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was designed to allow 400 metres of trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operated on the London-Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that in London there would be a need for an end stop where 20,000 passengers per hour could be handled.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be built to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would mean that the journey time between London and Scotland would continue to be over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial cruising point in order to ensure a change from aircraft to railway, a measure of direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for a Conservative's mortgage for 75,000 pounds of orangery
Alan Duncan, the leader of the Conservatives' House of Commons, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that members of the House of Commons had to live "of lean rations," increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak timber timber plant to his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The people in charge of the Lower House approved the applications at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenses of the Members of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said that the requests could not have been "more clean or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expense control office of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he grew a conservatory called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glashaus für Entertainment."
Duncan was also not asked to comment on increased cash intake during a recent study of its previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
Last month, the Committee cleared him of breaking the rules following an examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of £271,406 (€300,000) from his London house to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that by March last year Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase was used to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal infinite RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the Lower House in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live "of lean rations."
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live on lean rations and be treated like S*****e."
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden, and I am entitled to a very small portion of what belongs to me.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be considered "an exaggerated demand."
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign after it had become known that he had demanded £4,000 (€4,500) over three years.
When he was questioned about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by the Fees Office, and then by Legg for an increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about dodges and slamming or bending the rules or similar.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer."
Come to admire all her faithful to Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Strandhütten in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond," an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas carols as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried fruit pastries.
The so far selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël," where the decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketer, is a volunteer clergyman from the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organise exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to the demonstration that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, had smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-turbulent policemen intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people, most of whom are Blacks Blocs members, have been arrested in eastern France, in April, in these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction," and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "still held in the streets on Saturday night," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sitting position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators arrived with busses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first casserole in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice."
Today, we are going to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filippinian activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organisations.
European MEP José Bové, the figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has given the starting signal for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets.
In Manila there were hundreds of people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas in which you praised the solar energy.
In Hong-Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches took place by several hundred demonstrators to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that it is a "string."
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "string."
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist area that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed GMT at 5:00 p.m.
A few hours before the local elections, the turnout was about 58%, according to the Abkhaz electoral commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunion with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian-proof total occupation, has explained his press spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove, through this election, that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Herrn Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling place located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Big signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representative who came to monitor the electoral process.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as did the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at all times ready for action, have arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until December 18 receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful move marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed entirely in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash disks, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-turbulent policemen have encircled you immediately and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the floor.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards evening a policeman suffered an injury from a cobbled stone on his chin during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of order were circling in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or with their own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice."
"Today we are going to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say anymore: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that run away, there are watercourses that can run through, which has never been the case in the past."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of opponents of globalisation has approached environmental protection organisations.
French MEP José Bové, a critic of globalisation, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen "to combine climate justice and social justice." "Today there is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people went to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, most of them students, dressed in red with bandanas, have advertised the solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "Network of the 350," several hundred people joined forces, particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche," the national education minister Luc Chatel explained that geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées, although they are not compulsory in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have every four hours of the week and the same programme," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but, on the whole, a concentration of "the best pupils."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He emphasized: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the government's project of abolishing compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminale S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of Terminale S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday's protest against the project, which in their opinion is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they would undergo a subject-related aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admission test, in which their teaching skills will be tested.
They also do internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He also said: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will reach more hours that you have spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed again that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012."
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to discuss the stakes at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist of the AFP, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to know more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the school's basin.
"Among the experts, around twenty discussion participants were selected, even after their charisma," he specified.
"You can talk about global warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke in front of about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he emphasized in the hope that listeners might conclude that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school website as of December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment: angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the union of prison officials called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, which were postponed for budget reasons until January, were paid before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd union of prison officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the staff, who are not on duty, to demonstrate and block on Tuesday morning in front of the detention centre in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is due to them."
The 3rd union of prison officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons," in which the non-payment of the overtime, night surcharges and Sunday and holiday surcharges incurred in October were branded as "indecent and unacceptable."
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The head of the detention centre and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and that not all were planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining demands will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the prison officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the staff's efforts to maintain and modernise our prison system," the Minister of Justice notes in this letter.
"I instructed the head of the detention centre to take immediate action so that such a situation, which was caused by a lack of assessment of overtime, would not be repeated in the future," added Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore low, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional FO union in Marseille outrages and announces that it will boycott "all meetings and convocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT Trade Union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he is always giving Christmas gifts better than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who is going to spend Christmas with his family at the White House for the first time, has told Oprah Winfrey, a TV talkmaster, that he is always giving better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog of course also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I gave you beautiful gifts last year," she teased the president.
"So please," he scolded her mischievously, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour show in an informal atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter, who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten courses and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us at Christmas and brought me basketball," said the president.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her doll's house.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll's house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL confirmed that he was put into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for considerable "damages" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control," although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors found "damages caused by the operation of a herniated disc" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these injuries required a new operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and stated that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, it was only after 48 hours that RTL was somewhat more certain of the patient's condition when he opened his eyes.
At the request of the AFP there was neither confirmation nor comment on the part of the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" indicates that after his first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a herniated intervertebral disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday night.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley." However, he assured himself that "no worries" about the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter."
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to get on a plane for 12 hours after an operation like this, it wouldn't work like that," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained."
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he felt no particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer's health had increased since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "little colon cancer surgery," which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer on stage has had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny a re-entry to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favourite distance, 50m of freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short circuit in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while one had expected a true record flood.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m positions of gentlemen.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to grab after the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 sec,. in a finale with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croatians Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater things and in the present case I have said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began for the first time in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m of freestyle (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't achieve a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann explained.
USA: Tomb plate estimated at $1.5 million at Zola
A Roman grave plate, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at 1.5 million US dollars above its value, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two metres long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the third century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophistic architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, vice president of auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, opposite the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most," says the spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "Emile Zola heritage," which opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart."
Zelaya's exit from Honduras to Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil incompatible, after this escort by the coup government had rejected as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to suggest that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, explained the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Department, the plane that had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelaya had returned to its destination.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "thank him" and request political asylum for him abroad under escort.
However, the overthrown president refused to do so because he wished to return to Mexico as a welcome, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," said M. Zelaya on Thursday to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken to Radio Globo since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has sent us a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch government, told Honduran Radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
He had emphasized that a possible departure from Honduras would only be a President of the Honduran people.
The rumours of M. Zelaya's departure had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and the military there had intensified its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the Putsch government's position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the light of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached socialist Venetian President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the referendum he organised to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had unexpectedly returned from his exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he is arrested for treason, to which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninia or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street in recovery, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a recovery in the share price of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotically under the premise that the market focuses only on "semi-full glasses," so it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
By contrast, the analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the company research economy.com.
In return, last week's unemployment reports in the United States rose against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average number of new jobseekers has "fallen to the lowest point of the year" during the last four weeks, Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors emphasized.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to the 3.432 percent of Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492 percent compared to the 4.408% of the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle "Women in White"
On Thursday, several hundred partisans in the Cuban power rattled the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, which temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
Around forty "Women in Weiss," wives or close political prisoners, were whistled on the open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "merciers!", "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!"," "Fidel and Raul live!" chanted the authorized partisans with a raised fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "Women in Weiss" had taken place on the eve of Havana, where there were neither casualties nor arrests.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents who also participated in the demonstration on Thursday in view of the International Human Rights Day were temporarily arrested by civilian police officers, confirmed an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents, who were busted by the partisans of the government, to enter civilian vehicles under force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize, awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Women in Weiss" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "the request for the release of all political prisoners," whose number according to the dissident list has about 200 persons," Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "merciers" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstrations that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contrarevolutionarys."
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of slandering rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Madman kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old on Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first information from the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a person in charge of the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital, has succumbed to the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he took a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were sent to the hospital, where the eighty - year - old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life because, according to police sources, vital organs appear to have been affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police reports, is said to have escaped immediately to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passers-by, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, with the latter of them heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher's knives, which he wore crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including youths, are said to have tried to curb the madman, according to witness reports from the AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three teenagers tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city policemen, including her superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife stabbings, according to police information.
The event has taken place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passersby approached me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in a first-aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, came, injured by cuts.
State police forces finally arrested the man who didn't carry identification papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the District Department of the Hauts-de Seine Criminal Police (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The maniac was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't exclude him being admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were appalled to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation, " such as" all the spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces unleash during the course of action. "
USA: Polanski's Attorney Reiterates Recruitment
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently in court at his home in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney of the director of the "Pianist," denounced gross procedural errors at the time of trial in 1977 in front of three judges of the Court of Appeals in the second district of California.
I call for immunity on the spot, said M. Hummel, before he added that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who had been charged with the case at the time of the trial, "made it run cold down one's back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed with a prosecutor before the judge's verdict fell, who was said to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a penitentiary -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the questionable prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "belogened" the authors of the documentary film.
Should the Court refuse to stop criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel would require the conduct of a process which would enable him to present the evidence of his reasoning.
The indictment, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the facts charged with the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978 before the proclamation of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't travelled to the United States since that time.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who are a way out of escape?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In their opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thereby despises his authority. "
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to announce their decision - even pointed out that "there are other alternative escape options."
Hummel was not the only one who had applied to stop the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The attorney of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the annulment of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any revival of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September at the request of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the dollar's rise and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday in a market that was torn between better indicators than in the US and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that this will continue until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged, which "have contributed to improving the market view of the solidity of the recovery of the economy," summarised the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared with 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indices were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar exchange rate, which has been at the highest level against the euro for two months, thus "pressing down the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thereby lost some ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The bond yield over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared with 3.482% and the bond over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 contestants to the title of Miss World on Saturday will pass the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch a billion TV.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already got their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a veritable whirlpool of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and had a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 pm (5 pm Central European Time).
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhanova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes."
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, and to emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, the dream of every woman to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to forget in a swimsuit.
The performance will be presented by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and one of Miss World's leaders, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an unsurpassed cordiality and pride, assured Julia Morley, Chairman of the Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari to visit the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never be able to approach.
I'm sure I'll come back to the 2010 World Championship, promising Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news on Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news for Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. CET).
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital "quickly," where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a intervertebral disc incident on 26 November.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following intervertebral disc surgery on 26 November.
The singer had to undergo another surgery during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer of the AFP found.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles Hospital on Monday.
The producer has heavily burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely indignant, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled far too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles."
I made a personal phone call to this doctor, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself already had two intervertebral disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist's milieu.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant , a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation who has already been convicted several times for failing operations and not forgetting about tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, attorney of the medical association, described him as "a man without scruples," who is "regularly" responsible to the board of directors and is "anything but recommendable."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention had been "perfect" and that the post-operative investigations had been "normal."
The operation "didn't cause bleeding and therefore doesn't require drainage, " he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been unraveling since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The Union for French Democracy (UDF) is vigorously calling on the Nouveau Centre Party not to use its seal anymore
The coalition of parties, which is supervised by François Bayrou's party MoDem, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and called on him, under the threat of judicial prosecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he handed his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In order to emphasise his efforts, he had received the support of Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC), who claims the ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to apply for this brand to the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle" in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF party alliance, supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and, under the threat of judicial prosecution, set the Minister and the MP a time limit to stop using this seal and transfer the property rights of the trademark to it.
In the last few days you have made numerous statements that you would suggest to your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and the senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF + printed on your political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the office of the UDF, and called on the NC party "to remove without delay the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (its) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required to "transfer the property rights of the trademark to its legal right holders."
If you refuse to do so, we will sue you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds Morin and his friends to leave "the election" in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the "UMP" party.
The Nouveau Centre party, according to the undersigned, therefore has no right whatsoever to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 passed the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a office to defend "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "when he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the absence of the deposit of the acronym UDF, in order to do so for himself.
You also point out that this ruthlessness is on the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC's strategy: "In politics and in life, it seems more dignified to us to make a name for ourselves instead of trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name to which one has no legal claim."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to sneak up part of their fortunes.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to answer on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, a criminal offence punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter shred themselves and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Trial Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions provided by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will make clear whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's gonna go through these tests.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the trial.
As far as the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very pleased with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady who must be protected, he affirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years in order to sneak donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' playdays on Friday led to a large family debacle.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please tell my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage."
The Procuratorate of Nanterre once again considers that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardianship judge has refused her request to initiate proceedings against her mother in the last few days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the procedure for the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is intended for the personnel to join "values" the best as it used to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separated factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&E and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) demands "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view from all the parties involved"; it demands from the employees an effort to which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would consist of placing employees in the centre of the company's concerns alongside customers on an equal footing.
The very limited benefits of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
First of all, because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, after a lot of detours, the whole structure is finally beginning to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unwittingly widely spread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos published by Le Figaro.fr strengthens the executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and measuring the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage-earners, the commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of achieving a part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, companies' managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday evening and was pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the Republican Party's right wing in the U.S. Today daily, adding that she herself had raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs published as well.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the Presdent had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I felt that this speech was completely historic, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway."
The previous MP, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not hand over a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech."
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he "spoke like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "are living like a security bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," said Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, upbeat and inspiring."
On the left side of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defends the attack on the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the guise of justice, you can easily justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, described the speech itself as a "monumental work" for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a schedule for the management of international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily says enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Drivers: Three marathons for an agreement to secure the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the Road Federation and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening, which puts an end to the strike order and the imminent severe shortage of supplies for Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators split early on Friday morning hoping to sign the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was not signed until 6:00 p.m.
The conflict "had caused a great deal of damage to companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transports).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centres anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly ones who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will enable, in particular, to address the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the fall in employers' taxes of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft law on adjusted finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to the organisation and then applies to the entire profession if the Minister of Labour extends it.
This will be the case "in no time," Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the proceedings.
The FNTR Association denounced a "false trade" because the EUR 100 million "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to grieve the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens "to shovel a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months."
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued at the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent People's Transport Administration) continues to keep strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travellers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making an effort to connect the major businesses in terms of transport."
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains operated at peak hours, and almost none during the low traffic period.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he had "kept up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to travellers by staff and administrative staff, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, again general meetings of strikers were held, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a wage surcharge that has long been due.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its wage surcharge proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, while this was possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "is ignoring the weekend drivers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the office of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership who up to now rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the line RER B after a pre-announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision that immediately followed raging demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts which have lasted 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become "a seat for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and parliamentarians Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders said before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than meet like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wisdoms" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political shop window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court sparks the government in between, which strives to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to let the support of the PKK by the Kurds disappear and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, a city of millions, in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
The forces of order used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the demonstrators started throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen the despair even further."
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdische, anm. d. Redaktion) question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
That does not solve the problems," says Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"One can obviously prepare for a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK committed an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter officer.
But so that his employees can try out the entire vehicle technology and learn how to master it.
According to meteorologists, this could be the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES follows an exact plan.
As soon as it snows throughout Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes with large-scale vehicles are driven off, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire access routes, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is more sticky.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts."
It'll be difficult if it snows at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter officer, "because then no one is ready to make room for the scattering vehicle."
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, will it be the turn of feeder and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot people set off on the way, dangerous points and transitions are primarily cleared.
The FES can usually not take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is a smoothness on this fast, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, he is also called by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body traits, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which then lay in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they gathered the remains of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories on Dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current teaching opinion, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these original dinosaurs is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts are debating when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "Langhälse," and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischia (bird pool saurs), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the world, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangaea.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods suggests this.
The three cannot descend from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be a distorted picture, because in South America many primitive dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything can be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare lateral line of the reptile strain to the dominant terrestrial workings of the Earth's Middle Ages is still mysterious.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying saurs and numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the kinship on the border from the Triassic to the Jura died out.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that happened to survive the dinosaurs, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story didn't last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals, which had also developed in the Triassic, helped to bloom, and since then there has been a shadowy existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University beats waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also of universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commando."
The eviction was a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau had withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the squatters did not support the damage to property, he said.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also solidarizing with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's youth secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hesse's Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to Peter Beuth, member of the CDU's parliament.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, they had been cleared.
The Left has tabled a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow's capital, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret military research.
Today, the municipality, with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from Moscow's center, is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley."
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had already made contacts with the Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Vice-Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, and Frankfurt signed planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally "Grünstadt") received its name from the wooded hills in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe."
S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the state capital of Baden-Württemberg into unhealthy construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then regarded as 19th-century traffic fossils, which acted as brake blocks of modern rail transport, since it once took a huge amount of time to transform locomotives from the rear to the front.
Drive in, keep short, keep driving - that's the way it should go.
And that's why the stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a thoroughfare station, which is located about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the trans-European rail highway - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe."
S21 is actually being addressed now, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities it is almost priceless to implement the lowering.
However, head stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turnaround trains with traction units and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new ICE line to Ulm are now being approached.
State and local politicians have enforced it.
The railways are involved, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state corporation are borne.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban development.
New urban space is created, which - one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The through station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to huge growth.
At that time there was not yet competition of low-cost aircraft.
Modern transport policy must first, however, be about strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy climbs.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be buried in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180-kilometer-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built in slow motion.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine Valley route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on airport
In the Wiesbaden Landtag, the state government left open whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally examined, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
On this day, the VGH in Kassel had writtenly stated that if the planned northwest runway was to be built in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to redefine the ban on night flights.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the state government, was incompatible with the legal protection of the population against night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going to review the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government's representatives to refrain from a revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises on a night flight ban. Otherwise, this was to be regarded as a "word break."
It's damn hard to keep your word, said Green boss Tarek Al-Wazir in allusion to the FDP election slogan "We keep word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government was trying to come to their night flights with "right-wing twisting and trickery."
Exact legal review takes time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as it represented the opposition, his group's statements on the ban on night flights had never been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-ridden U.S. big banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in the amount of 45 billion dollars (good 30 billion euros) in one blow.
And the Citigroup, according to a report by the US channel CNBC, plans to repay the state aid.
The institutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money - for example, the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had purchased 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well-filled, among other things, by branch sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: the injection of money helped over a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the cashhouse had been removed with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
It all went faster than I thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the personal issues.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin, was considered a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the station for this - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it is also likely that it has played a role not to further damage ZDF director Markus Schächter if this proposal does not get through with the Board of Directors either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet clear at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a bitter defeat for butchers, but an expected one.
The Union's majority in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in office.
Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief.
With the argument that the ZDF's news broadcasts had lost their ratings under Brender, he rejected another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
In the last instance, 35 state-law activists had even intervened in the debate, which regarded Koch's actions as unconstitutional.
It didn't do any good.
Person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
Afterwards he worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "today-journal."
Following stations: From 1988 to 1990 personal secretary of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "morning magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
After the election of Brender, who was elected journalist of the year by the medium magazine, on Wednesday, the Greens announced a constitutional suit.
Koch's counterpart on the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF state treaty in such a way that staff proposals by the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's prospective successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever move - by strongly criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both butchers without loss of face could nominate him for the position of editor-in-chief and the board of directors could elect him without suspecting that he would hold a party-goer in office.
In party arithmetic Frey is assigned to the left-liberals anyway.
Study gets cleaned out
Partial success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the Ministers of Education of the countries finally arrived on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Education and Rectors' Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: In principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of students is to be checked and "a realistic and reasonable measure" guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master courses more flexible.
In addition, there should be no different country rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been carrying the winged word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module usually completes with only one exam," says a 30-page paper, which is supposed to regulate the admission of study programmes in part.
With the "clear reduction of the audit load," the Accreditation Board Chairman Reinhold Grimm explained, "the aim is to stop a lack of development that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" is to be "the decisive criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strengthened to check" whether "unnecessary limitations of students when choosing
Events."
Students would be entitled "to have room for manoeuvre, to enable and promote their own initiative."
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the examination of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany are responsible for this task, which are under the responsibility of the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had urged the countries "with a strong voice" to influence the agencies in such a way that the volume of material was not too large and the audit regime was not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of this money, the universities are primarily to set up tutorial programs and strengthen student advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a amendment to the Higher Education Act into the parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the design of studies more flexible and to ensure the recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all of the country's study programmes will be reviewed for their studyability.
The government and opposition had once again argued on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students as affected should now also "contribute a word."
The future academics received support from the president of the HRK, Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experiences," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Education on Thursday, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Education and Science (GEW) union did not go far enough to reach Bonn's decisions as a whole: it demands a legal claim that gives every graduate with a bachelor's degree access to a further master's degree course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have enough master's positions with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to recruit significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering in Germany and out is beautifully almost no control" ... is the beginning of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which this disturbing scoop of language addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but has lost his language space at the same time.
Born in Banat, Romania in 1951, Werner Söllner had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary attention last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of its securities acts."
Söllner was visibly insecure and embarrassed by an explanation in which he confessed to his work as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate in front of Romanian writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun sneaking, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted the intimidation attempts of the Securitate enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and discord of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, according to Söllner's confession, the literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter.
Markel said that he had "cut him out" in all the difficult points for him at the time.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not completely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate tips, Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, it may be assumed, will be speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the alias Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the process-proof sighting of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
Systematic education has been undermined and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Processing of Securitate Files (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthler Authority was founded only in 1999, but the publication of the files has been slow ever since.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great was confirmed by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate CEO from Temesvar made a negative statement about the prize winner.
She had a psychosis, after all, they only interrogated her once.
The infamy of power here meant to be able to express itself quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the case of Söllner, as is so often the case in connection with concealed guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Whom has been harmed? The listeners' prudent reaction to Söllner's confession makes us hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge to know rather than by blame and shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adret-dressed sales representative coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sportswear manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the supplier, climbed a quarter of an hour after midnight into a summoned C-Class. ̈
The man with the distinctive baldness was chauffeured because of the city he was still stranger to.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol wasn't in the game after all, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or just get going.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier: "We have achieved the eighth round," namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally tough fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king class performance in the league everyday in Mainz.
And to put down the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Draw
The 8th round of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16./17. + 23./24 February/ Rückspiele 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of the brilliant intervention of the Babbel successor remained restrained.
Not only with the supposed healer, who had conveyed self-confidence, commitment and playfulness to the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and I stopped them to be braver, Soul-Stempler Gross explained the simple-sounding recipe for success, which, however, had no effect on the therapist Babbel.
He has kindled a certain magic, Babbel's advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week's break in injury, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the identified "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who breaks through and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Babbel obviously lacked it.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns Sports Board member Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs Constance above all.
Like Gross, players and managers guarded against overestimating the victory against a spare-weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later the evil awakening came in Leverkusen at 0:4, Khedira gave thought to it.
And Sports Board member Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which revived in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that make others and not the Jens, countered hero the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of management of lack of leadership and decided to change coaches on pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann also considered that his free day after playing had been cancelled as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disgust.
Lehmann's statements were "influenced by pure selfishness," Heldt hurled back and announced consequences for the end man.
I guess you're not gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the replaced coaching team the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
Heavyweight World Championship Fight
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko repeatedly provoked with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The judge's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after the WBC version defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) in Bern on Saturday night.
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the knockout that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give himself defeated due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to face the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-meter-large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
However, the 11 centimetre smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly withdrew from the beatings of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the finish.
All in all, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings only rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused some vortexes before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right."
On Friday, the champion was provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and brought back "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to leave without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States.
I only got one blow in this fight and am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of the WBO and IBF Associations.
However, the British David Haye wears the belt of the WBA after it was able to dethrone the 2.13 metre Nikolai Valuyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
It is said that his PhD company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition assumed a deliberate deception by defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU).
The minister had said "knowingly the untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tanker trains in September," said Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news program "Tagesschau."
It's commonly called: he lied.
The order to kill had been issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO has read, Mr Guttenberg said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted trucks, but also about killing two Taliban leaders in a targeted manner.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) called on the Greens, the SPD and the Left to speak immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and the Greens-College called for Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the presentation of the ministry about the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and completely informed about the background of the Tanklaster attack.
Officially, it had been said that they denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the background of the two top officials, they reported that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung."
He has not yet received an answer, he says.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a precarious state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality blur not only in the mentally ill and in the drug rush.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to indulge in the wildest ideas and fantasies.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in the growing world, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a special species.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Our imagination is at fault: the same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality.
Dreamlike changing waking consciousness states can occur in a wide variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection between delusion and dream has been occupied by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great resemblance of madness with dream states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, sensuality of such a."
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity has no power over him, it floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted bratches, teething.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, malicious voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and lays the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose's loosening.
This should be a lesson for you, screaming the voices in drum-flailing chorus, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, moreover he is manic-depressant, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The false images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they fall into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, grandeur, relationship or persecution delusions.
Voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or diagnose.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned is no longer able to separate important things from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning for it.
At the same time he becomes a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, similar to the dream, and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually impossible for them, the illusions are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in a real context.
Why exactly our brains are beating caprioles, researchers are still puzzling.
In every human being, states of exception can cause him to lose his reference to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery of how the neuronal system is disturbed, which at first does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis when disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brains run hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of position.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head."
Halucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people is hallucinating under certain conditions.
As Box says, hallucinations are made up of memory contents that are usually held back.
They arise when areas of the brain where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or also when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritating deprivation, stress, heartache or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported that they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break, it may happen that a shaky boy with long, dark hair responds to it.
When it answers to him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spooky daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other fakes aren't real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary
Often the false images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher is presenting a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he is explaining mathematical equations for all the others listening and visible on the table.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot tell if she is awake or dreaming whether the images she sees, the grunts or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her about it, they think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Faith is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimuli deprivation, he will most likely have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is then under-employed and is responsible for his own conversation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls Daddy hasn't been her biological father since she could think.
Since the same areas of the brain are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected such as Sarah K. to distinguish false images and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is reflected there.
Halucinations are also images that make the brain develop, which is why they seem so real."
Even nightly dream pictures consider Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their illusions as unreal.
Box therefore advises his patients to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too consciously centered world, imaginary experience is usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneioid form of experience, a special form of the dreamlike changed wake-consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the survivor considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state in retrospect.
The oneioid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by loss of self and world, for example by persistent, total immobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is brought to mind in the imagination.
An intense form of meaningfulness and sensuality in an unbearable situation, which enables us humans' own ability to design not to perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is sentenced to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immerses himself in a self-made world, visiting strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Deported by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the fir snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travels are still very clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience transcends the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroide, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are in the guard.
Every change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publishing director Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have precautionaryally regulated the details of this.
The question whether they are also active in the company only arises afterwards.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
You can't put 7500 employees in front of your children if they're not sufficiently qualified.
That kills the kids and the company, too.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he would withdraw from the Executive Board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, the Treasury department became responsible for corporate assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, also for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publisher.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The naming of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe before the fall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction that had completely speculated and thought that they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy never was.
He had "never dreamed of world power," says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political precept of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the world league with 'Time' either, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that's what El Corte Inglés has planned, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about personal care.
In the spa area, located on the eighth floor, you will find some prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which make for depilation with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own beauty party with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen located opposite the devices.
Afterwards, various videos show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to train the body muscles.
And if you want to stop by the hairdressing salon after training your body, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments are offered in a personalized way to restore the beauty, shine and health of your hair.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most varied décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festival dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The power company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office."
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility through management, coordination, subsidy, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is currently being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise the opinions and actions of the sectors involved.
This is an attempt to push forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electrical cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT verde.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace."
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the steps taken by the government to support the automotive sector in the course of the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would now have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to continue producing in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the pursuit of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects from 19 car manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn generated investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to boost demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in exhaust emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by 40 percent in November.
On 20,000 quadrameters of classic vehicles
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classical Motor Show, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially designed race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, named i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out with its good grades in the overall picture.
The end processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and a good hold.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
When looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, one can see that Mazda is in the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colours red and blue.
This style reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two compact Japanese cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive comfortably by car.
To all this comes a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gearshifting and its low consumption, even though at Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model, which was selected for the test drive, is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the series equipment stands out above all the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the blind angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learningable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative of this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the Sportive model.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pleasure every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine," the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shone more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is very limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without the possibility of seeing certain attachments or surfing the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone's flat rate.
After seeing the company's success, it launched two new devices: one that is only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries, however, as its American counterpart, has a surprise at hand.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you need a doctorate in physics and a good pair of glasses to read all the small prints.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (although it's always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn't have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer these kinds of tariffs means that telephone providers need to think slowly, but safely, and start considering different ways in which they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without transport and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, namely when buying, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase opportunity with lifelong internet access as Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the USA, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has re-elected the same color to accompany him in his second most important moment in his life, without a doubt: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the dress consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric, and in addition it wore somewhat large embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes to the point that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet dress in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a similar model, but gold-colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, while the previous one was wearing the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fruitability and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market limited by their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, on the type of occupation they pursue.
Those of them who do no other activity outside the house, only work half-days or have no fixed contract of employment, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a permanent job, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the 35-49 age group with a permanent job receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after they move together, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have moved together and the first child only achieved it much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar with regard to conception readiness," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and in the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be observed among women of the same age.
For example, women in the group aged between 35 and 49 became mothers for the first time, on average 25.1 or 32.1 depending on whether they only have a secondary education or a higher education.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a major degree marry before their first permanent job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly the other way around and first find themselves a permanent job and marry afterwards and then have their first child, notes Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his envy list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it."
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël," one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous flagship as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (actor colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of this year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker Game
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, pictures by Fernando Vicente) to the thirty x-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear - inspiring genre (short biography, life, and work), but seeks an affinity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on horrors or enlightenments.
Except that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the calamitous fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him. "
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, to the extent that the flesh of which emotions were united with the pleasure of repentance because of adultery, a spiritual privilege that was to go to heaven on the detour of destruction. "
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 peaks in worldwide literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird pussy.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county, and yet again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry, which was shouted out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo echo echoed deeply into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This he did on a journey, on which he fled from himself and begged the posterity with a speech full of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt and prayed: my venerable God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are engraved by Spencer: ' sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the harbor,/ the peace after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spied on her between the azaleas or the birds sang in Greek.
There is not a single other case known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What, then, did Benet intend if he did not introduce Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this pedestal?"
Fig aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran beside her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid that we took out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they missed him two footsteps and hurt him severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, since it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on a leash.
In addition, the suffocation that a woman who went for a leisurely walk had when she tried to correct these persons because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a maniac attacks a dog, he might do the same with a woman, a child, an older master, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will do anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what has happened has led us to denounce this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of her commitment to road safety, which "comprises far more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming more and more secure every day," and reiterated that they also contribute, with other actions of an educational and informative nature, to getting one step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters in a first phase to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that they, as manufacturers of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, are always committed to ensuring that one of their main objectives is the development of increasingly safer products.
Sales of small trucks are picking up again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008 and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for the comparison are from November 2008 which was a particularly bad year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, one must bear in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles that make up the small transporter market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky that affect demand the most, because even though some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the bulk of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with third-party financing, goes.
For example, there are other factors that need to be included in these restrictions, which are the result of the money tap being turned on by credit institutions, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of Plan 2000E has been of little help.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also for the self-employed and small businesses who want to buy a small van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Car Dealer Association predicts a similar year for 2010 as the one it has just passed, for which it expects a loss of sales (in the case of passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as it is now happening with the ESP stability control system, the emergency braking assistance systems must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period was set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the action decided by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many collisions due to their operation.
The emergency braking assistant's task is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the braking strength carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake support, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car covers during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistance.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents is expected to be prevented by personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the Opel plant's workforce in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
In fact, Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europa, wants the affected party to give its approval to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American carmaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which is backed by the Russian Converg group, is becoming increasingly popular.
If none of these buyers come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, with which he now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they first avoided the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent canvas roof with manual drive, so that only 21 kilos have been saved; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning system again 13; moreover, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again five saved.
Then, by the abandonment of the audio system CDR-30, six kilos less had been achieved and the missing kilo had been achieved by the replacement of the door handles by handles made of fabric.
Although it is also available with the PDK double clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed manual gearbox, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
In his driving behavior you can only give him the touch impeccably.
However, reducing its weight has by no means meant that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, but at the same time it gives you a sense of great safety at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles during a low course in the necessary time, until we give him the orders to race, slow down, recover and then again get everything out of his engine...
He does everything he's told, the car does everything we say to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motoround for all flavors
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and it can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
Acceleration is incredibly brutal, whether from standing up or again accelerating.
The suspension is strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads, on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and this, although we found ice at dawn and roll split in the morning on some of these curves.
To sum up, it's an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it usually rarely exists, and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will enter the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stubbornness of her neck as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she's a "Bag Girl."
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an outstanding triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of dedication and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Reds, who sat on the top of the scoreboard from the very beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the playing field with well warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava chose an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to expand their advantage further to the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" score of Splitter could already be guessed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was by no means decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone on their playing field wins, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the fact that the "Yellows" turned the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with security to get some air again and one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the scoreboard again calming distance of (54-67) was displayed, which the host could embellish at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavese were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitters were put off because of fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended themselves well and although the Israelis caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being foreheaded
Unicaja lost loudly against Olympiacos in Greece and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, which was marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior game, which facilitated the Greeks' victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Eins Unicaja, even though the local team, with an indoor match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortanitis, managed to score 22-20 in their favor in the 13th minute, the minute when the two Americans, Beverley and Williams, almost got into a fight due to an action, and both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to finally warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the Englishman Joel Freeland's departure from Unicaja due to an injury and the three self-made mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian foreplayer Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference between the 66-48 game played in Malaga in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to waver.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the departure of the injured Scotsman Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31st minute, thanks to the leadership and the threefold of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was again some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be slowed down.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give himself up and had to resign the lead atOlympiacos.
How much should you earn due to your profile in Facebook?
Facebook users can now experience their salary thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates users' salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a Facebook form to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city where they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker feels on average "bad paid," explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual 11,592 euros net; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires that day and he has to find a new place to stay."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the Brazilian government," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (where Porfirio Lobo won), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed due to Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician that the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to give the liquidity free hand at interest rates moving around zero so that the banks would buy assets to settle.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are virtually over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to spread some sand into the gear, as BCE näc has already done with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and sovereign debt is rising again.
The focus is now on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred places of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences of the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision down regarding the valuation of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy, of what they had caused, since they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting loans to the loss of jobs, when they were supposed to have taken a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals public debt, elections and a new government that pulls in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens with it in the need for extracurricular measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauchery on too high amounts, that would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same pace as European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences were to decrease and the Spanish would continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the early indicators here force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to revise their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are back on track with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long service life despite warnings.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "care while driving" is announced.

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before Parliament's sub-committee, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros and another 60 billion from this date until 2030 by 2020, subject to the condition that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but rather in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the condition of course by other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the proposal for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly set, despite some"individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Whether or not, Galán believes that decisions on investment should already be taken now, even if they are in the long term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which no figures have yet been announced, is scheduled for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to study energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
Construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city council wants the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan prepared by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and toll station management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia in the final phase, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing with each other.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues, is competing against the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrowest choice, is called LBRJV, formed of the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction and privatisation, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as only by buying a local construction company can you get access.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish builders.
Even ACS has only acquired access to this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the Leighton mentioned above.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the sector in which it is already well known due to its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll line, which is promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and is called Northern Link (Nordzubringer), has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass road (see map) over a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels. This is the largest measure to reduce congestion on the Brisbane streets.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award of summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December of next year.
Even if this toll line is to open up to traffic in the last few months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland is involved in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big deal.
Australia is repeatedly awarding considerable contracts to Hochtief, who signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic fibre-optic broadband network through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC awarded the contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has acquired the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had been awarded the contract for the construction of the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and its implementation will last for 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company informed.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, who presented Sch to this competition, which Renfe had announced, 4 of which came into the final round, among them TBWA, who over the last three years was responsible for the advertising.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Punishment of over 63 million for France Télécom for the brake on competition.
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine on France Télécom over EUR 63 million for its anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in landline and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly company and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that oversees competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore fallen back again.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade site on the Internet to increase revenue from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this Orange website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for this Siete to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
Madrid and Barça have contributed 476.4 million to the Champions League since the beginning.
The Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, giving them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that earned the most money in the league.
==References====External links==*Official website
==References====External links==*Official website
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its foundation in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one next to AC Milan who has won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 took fifth place.
Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also made the most money through their participation in the past Champoons League, lead the list.
And even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four bie Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects the Champions League to generate 1,090 million revenue.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a match received 3.8 million due to their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth round receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarterfinals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who receives 5.2 million.
So a football club gets at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, which amount to 337.8 million.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each TV market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places allocated.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday leaked details of the offer of shares with which it intends to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that, due to the number of shares, does not force them to make a public tender (opa).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
On completion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos further restructures his management.
In an attempt to stay on the verge of possible offers of purchase and the judicial troubles of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high post at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the responsibility of the Group Chairman.
This is anything but free from polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
In view of the Salazar's credit, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves Paternina's public invitation to tender for exclusion submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender for the exclusion of Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were in compliance with the final laws and that the content of the explanatory note submitted, after the amendments of last December, could therefore be considered "sufficient."
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the company's capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
In addition, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the final laws.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only the automotive workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged to the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and hours of work can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process it afterwards and to offer it to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reports are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with in the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is becoming larger and larger, up to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes onto the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a tedious task, because each one of the thousands of vehicle parts has to be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "smart" graphic image, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed within a week if the procedure is proceeding rapidly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the roads, it is more than 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex annually invests 90 million euros in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in various ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the filing or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a guide about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When looking through the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the kind of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for the assessment of accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for according to the intended use, i.e. for each expert opinion.
Most expensive it will be for customers who use it rarely, maximum ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
In contrast, any insurance company that makes thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran off the assembly line, solely by means of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the car discs, and AudaSubastas is an internet service open to the specialist market, which can be offered for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information on trade mark and model deviations.
One can, for example, examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides digital images in the same way, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Group Einsa, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Expert Review Guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and sales amounted to 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year they started to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
They have been on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and are part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Auction of car accidents on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a flat face on the Internet for the sale of automobiles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed daily and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been unregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars of historical value may be re-registered, even if they have been cancelled after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
Easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of working hours, surcharges or discounts, and then he can print out the estimate and pass it on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay for.
Audatex is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for for for a long time, for example, because they can choose a door and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
