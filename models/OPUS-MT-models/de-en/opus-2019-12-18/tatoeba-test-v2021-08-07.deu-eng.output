The main task of the kings was to build a tomb which was thought to be as timeless as the stars would seem above the sand of the time when everything else sank. The planning of post-life was more important than life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led them to remember it gloriously on the walls of this tomb, in whose stone the scenes were carved. Certainly much was beautified, and in the later times even battles that had not taken place were depicted.
