Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was reported by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire had broken out at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with about 200 fire engines.
The fire could be stopped
Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called eveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people are working in the plant. The chemical factory has already been making headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas Methanthiol was leaked by a leak and the surrounding area smelled far-reaching after rotten eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system after an operational accident.
Woman quits her job to look 57 days for her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and she specifically quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days lacked any trace of the bitch - but Carole King didn't give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Afterwards, when they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could still be in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers opposite "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But weeks came for days. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake," who quit her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: a man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled according to "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears were flowing. People stopped in her vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Loss in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "scaring" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troupe recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This can be seen from a classified list of the Federal Defense Ministry, which the editorial network Germany reports about.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 shots of ammunition have appeared again so far. The weapons and parts of weapons that have still disappeared are, among other things, six machine guns of type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two guns of type P8. In addition, 30 gun tubes for machine guns of type MG3 are missing.
The amount of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "terrifying," said Martina Renner, member of the left-wing Bundestag. This was all the more true since hardly anything was found again in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "needy balance sheet." Renner criticized that the listing did not reveal whether there was also one among the vanished ammunition found in connection with the investigations against the suspected German Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "And this despite the fact that a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially it remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official communication from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been charged on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Strait of Hormuz with violating security regulations. However, Iran was suspected to react to the controversial, temporary setting of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which is part of Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR, who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens would have shaken the former GDR regime, said Merkel at a festive act of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor recalled the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken away from terror," she said.
Musk strives for extradition record
Tesla's quarter may hold record. Despite the delivery boom, there have been losses at the electric car group last.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record figures on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek."
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued. The challenge was to get the cars to the customers quickly. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price hasn't increased so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95000 cars and thus reached its best value to date.
Musk needs records to reach its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six figures have to be produced in the current and upcoming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzles Solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebellum prevents people from tickling themselves. Researchers at Humboldt University in Berlin found this by means of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question of why children are so fiercely opposed to tickling, only to demand more.
After all, it was also shown why the approach of a tickling hand only triggers laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the cerebral brain, which triggers the laughter already in the expectation of tickling.
According to previous research, rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when tickled by humans. This "laughter" is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and touch by others - that is, people cannot tickle themselves. However, the researchers in Berlin now discovered in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the respective area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touching process. This was also the case when living beings clean themselves. However, during the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were increased.
But if the self-touching and the touch of others at the same time occurred, the laughter was also suppressed. This indicates that the rat's brain could not distinguish between self-touching and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-touching activates a brake in the cerebral brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes stopped this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showing escape behavior or terror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: large fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant considered to be particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was shared by the prefecture of Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out at night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no substances harmful to health are said to have resigned. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by her own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first part-session in Parliament after the forced recess was lifted on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without EU agreements on 31 October if Brussels does not respond to his demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to reunite this country would be to exit the EU." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum election campaign.
Monument to Attacks of Oslo and Utöya Unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind of the roses that thousands of people had left in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled at the same location - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. The opening is expected, among other Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
Right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had fired a car bomb in the government district of Oslo on July 22nd, 2011 and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a summer camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on Utöya Island. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero," which was held in Iran, was able to sail again. It could be a puzzle piece in Iran's President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero," which has been held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now travelling to Dubai for medical examinations, explained shipping director Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "Nice that it is over," he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," stated a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding the rules of the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well in the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the past ten weeks in the face of the difficult and exhausting situation. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar after the establishment of the "Stena Impero": At the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria, had been put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery was against EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian ARYA-1" was finally released. London vehemently rejected conjectures that it was a trade to free the "Stena Impero."
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have increased immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US had left the international nuclear agreement in 2018 alone, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the Tehran leadership with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and extended agreement to other areas. Iran has resisted pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iran's President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers, wanted to ensure the safety of navigation in the Persian Gulf with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a "war-winner." Given the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to displace. CFOs of Asian companies who are considering moving their production from China to another country, India, in a survey by UBS, is one of the preferred alternatives. This, of course, does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more important role in the global wide-ranging production chain.
But now India itself has become Trump's focus. Deprecated as the "kingdom of customs" by the Haudegen in the White House, America has withdrawn trade concessions for 2000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The US is prohibiting high tariffs for India and calling for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, merely a side-show. In addition, America looks at the world's largest democracy also through the security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's claims for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salute of American penal tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just begun a second five-year term, is therefore likely to be in safety.
The problem is, however, in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development is having a hard time in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. His reform zeal is primarily aimed at the bureaucratic insanity that choked every entrepreneurial spirit for too long in the multi-ethnic state. Companies are now receiving faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more gripping insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for the rapid liquidation of shiny-out companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned for the better in India in the first five modes years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. The national conservative government even set up new barriers, inspired by the fact that internationally few competitive companies are protected from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country. Not least, this impression is due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well which vocabulary Western managers like. However, at its core, the "India First" advocacy never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain about this short-sighted policy.
Confession of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, the former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP on the basis of the Chirac family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral was scheduled for Sunday in the Invalidity Cathedral in Paris, as media reported.
Bringing competitors to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
In the first run of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to wave dangerously. He could hardly keep himself on his feet 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthy bent posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly interrupted him and, supporting him, dragged the last half of the stadium round into the finish line. However, the forces were still enough for both of them to stop the wristwatch running after the finish run. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists. Shy he avoided, didn't want to talk at all about his exploit. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help one of his fellow sufferers. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Cup. Under normal circumstances, he couldn't even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did so forcefully on the evening - and much more intensively than he probably would have thought. Because this heroic act will remain in memory. Dabo even let his rival Busby take the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, about five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had used nothing, because the Busby, which came to the finish only with a lot of help, was disqualified at the end of the world's athletics association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set a personal best time at the World Championships in Doha. According to official data, he managed to achieve this with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes ago." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million mash: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible protests critical of the government. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
Already in recent days, the police had stepped up their road controls and partly searched pedestrian phones for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, protests with hundreds of participants took place against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. Egypt had not had such an open protest against the political leadership for years. Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, who was living in exile in Spain, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" in central places in the country this Friday. Ali demands a "people's revolution." For most young Egyptians, the man is not a "good man" either, because as a sub-contractor for the army, he scorned millions, but his messages arrive.
According to two observer groups, the number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures could not be confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported on the basis of lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the charges against the arrested ranged from "dispersal of false information" to membership of a "terrorist association." In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, also arbitrarily questioned and searched passers-by according to HRW information.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailer: mail order dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from VAT on donations in kind, the Ministry explained on a question from the Green Party of the German Bundestag, about which the newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe reported on Friday. However, the dealers could set the market value of the unsolicited returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that the Germans would send back every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - some 20 million products - were then in the garbage. According to the current legal situation, they would donate the companies additional money, because the tax authorities assess donations in kind as a turnover, which will then be subject to VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify by issuing a decree that companies cannot evaluate sales products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations, not only for online trading, but also for other businesses from the fashion store to the hardware market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament," is about to be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the restoration of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the basic attitude of animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned off on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly known as the "Devolved Parliament," was renamed "Devolved Parliament."
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Finally, on Wednesday at the first meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following the suspension of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, offered a hard exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson, if necessary, intends to carry out the Brexit, which had already been postponed twice on 31 October, without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in the south-east of England, he painted a painting depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the work every day when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a walk in the park
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We will quit (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of "treason" of the people, among other things. He dismissed allegations that he could thereby put the MPs at risk because they could become targets of murder threats, for example, as a "humbug."
Cummings said the only way to return to peace was if the British MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were upset that Britain still hadn't quit the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, said Khan at the Uno General Debate in New York on Friday. "If this goes badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn autonomy from the Indian Kashmir region and thus abruptly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It shoots at the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 prisoners join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison. Protest has never been safe in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario like in the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that also the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, the dilemma in the supermarket is also an old one. Critically, it is always when large parts of the population have difficulty in affording a bottle of water at all.
Tüv exams in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months it was checked whether the complicated plant mesh in the BER fire protection works in conjunction. The operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet finished on the BER.
After large-scale Tüv audits in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still shortcomings to work on in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is not likely to be too large anymore. The construction completion notification is now due to be submitted to the Construction Office in the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of faults in power cables still have to be fixed; the Tüv wants to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must be continued on the handling of the defects," stated a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no clearance for all the dowels on which the cable paths are hanging. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the crossing to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that shut down in a fire like a screen so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 motors therefore need to be replaced. Then there are new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should go into operation in 2011. Costs since the start of construction in 2006 increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros at the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsible parties are planning to expand the airport. This is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board is scheduled to take place on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster moves to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finance on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and he blew up a number of vending machines in the city of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally imprisoned!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply. Millions of damage was caused!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police caught a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstraße and the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police Spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations into the induction of explosive explosions in crime unit with particularly serious cases of theft carried out by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer confessed now a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his drug dependence with the prey." The bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on the Bürgerstraße four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further vending machines in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," confirmed a press spokesman from Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Viennese base of Lufthansa's Eurowings is thus disbanded de facto. Four of the current seven Eurowings aircraft remain in Vienna. From January 2020 onwards, this will be taken over by the AUA in the "Wetlease," i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesperson explained. Flight times will be coordinated for connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serve as a "Production Company" for the Group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights flying under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki bankruptcy, a price fight broke out at Vienna Airport. Ryanair's subsidiary, Laudamotion, announced that the fleet in Vienna will be increased to 16 aircraft on Thursday next summer. The Irish low-cost airliner sends four Ryanair machines with crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "wetlease," which the union criticised as a bypass construct to the collective agreement.
On Friday, Andreas Otto, CEO of Ryanair, said that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years: "We will remain the number one at the site in five, six or ten years' time."
Queen Uncle Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped for the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31).
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married," said the couple, who has been together since October 2018 according to British media reports, in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years, full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal festival
The wedding is due to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced by the Palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration to the marriage of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genome of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking countries, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) informed on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high mountain clinic Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the most influential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not well known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - according to the clinic. Each year about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the investigation of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancers are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data for the study of other diseases. So far, the clinic of the foundation in Davos deals primarily with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be created on the medical campus there and a professorship in bioinformatics was to be created. In order to justify his commitment, the logistics company living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The bio samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study." With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world according to the clinic. In genetic decoding, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It concerns a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human can now be decoded within 24 hours. The pure physical costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to begin on 1 October and all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian Police Free Hundreds of Maltreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police liberated more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were minors, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught and "better" in the Koran. Indeed, the protégés had been held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhuman conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children nine years of age, had been chained up in a small room.
According to the report, the Koran school has existed for about ten years. Local residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had not suspected the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief agency, more than 40,000 people have fled the border to the neighbouring country of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigerian Police Free 400 Children from School
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria have liberated nearly 400 students from horrible conditions. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "humanly unworthy." The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in a noticeably poor health condition.
World Soccer Election: Further allegations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "signatory not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, other countries brought accusations to Fifa. Egypt was not rated at all - with a curious reason.
Much of Fifa's past years have proved to be annoying: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Cup election has not so far been suspected of running out of control - if one fails to see that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote by sympathy rather than by objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologises insofar as "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid." They had contacted the Egyptian Association several times in order to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach also surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was just as received, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "Didn't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted on his behalf.
On Friday the association received the message: True, but was of course no intention. The completed electoral documents were "mistakenly" marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a message from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually elected. "We assume responsibility for the administrative error," said the message. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official FIFA list."
The other cases are now being examined by Fifa, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Football Championship - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine-Affair: Ranking Republicans Speak for Official Investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, is determined by the facts found." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the democratic candidate for the presidency and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden observed "for years."
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, only a few have shown unease about it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's policy several times, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right course of action and the responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of US states, formally have no say in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Therefore, their statements are primarily symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also voiced criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also reported that among the Republicans first cracks were in the interior.
The affair could result in the initiation of an impeachment procedure against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, which they accuse of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the dismissal procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on a actual removal of office was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore small. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were Torturers on Board of Rackete's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally attacked the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybian refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious allegations against Rackete are being raised. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3." The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any reliable information," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police reported in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence," said the report.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people escape from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that the perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is pursued."
Italy's right-wing ex-minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek."
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued. The challenge was to get the cars to the customers quickly. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price hasn't increased so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value to date.
Musk needs records to reach its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six figures have to be produced in the current and upcoming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budget dispute: once again only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the US on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again standing before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have taken place on Monday at midnight, part of the Federal Administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019, which will end on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the Federal Administration will not be able to benefit from the expenditure framework extended from 1.3 bio to 1.4 bio for the new financial year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have hardly any chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly capable of multiplying.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to try to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are interfering with the wall plans and their financing, which is actually planned for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the building of the wall had escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The Ghosts Divorce on the Wall
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. Probably more than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21 is possible. Even a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the Congress' continuing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process gain popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, stop the travel activity of the parliamentarians and hold back their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will also be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a bill by the government, after which all women can claim in vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Episcopal Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, defended by Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as an "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by the social security system.
Insemination with sperm from dead husband further forbidden
In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem." In Germany, in the past, there have been cases in which women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased person. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a child was then carrying a "especially severe fate."
Many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed it in favour of artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be burdened with "double grief" if her wish for a child was not fulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that, in future, a widow may be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot produce children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that surrogacy will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: calls for air tax for universities become louder
A lot is being flown at universities, which is why the country wants a climate tax to be paid there in the future, too. Rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate tax on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer break, is getting back on track. After the State Rectors' Conference had skeptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral candidates of six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a Pedagogical University argue for compensation of service flights. This was the first step "in urgent need" and at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, according to their opinion. The cabinet decision, which was originally planned in July, is still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the Greens' submission.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB secret service, the arrested were illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a fire exchange between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. However, this time there were no casualties, it was said.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. According to their own information, the Russian Coast Guard patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 squids seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there for some time this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained about high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrowly meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be disassembled.
Only 18,000 left in the future: USA reduces asylum upper limit
The "largest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shielding itself from those seeking protection: as the Washington State Department confirms, the ceiling for the legal immigration of refugees will continue to be lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at most 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the U.S. Department of State stated. In the now almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception readiness for protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher reception limits had been achieved.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. Nevertheless, the Foreign Ministry described the U.S. as "the most merciful and generous nation in history," a formulation that strongly recalls the use of the current U.S. President.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at enabling refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction, Trump explained. Supporters give him a lot of encouragement for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
Trump had imposed a national emergency to finance the construction of a border wall. It is unclear whether there is a temporal relationship between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a possible threat of impeachment.
According to the U.S. Foreign Office, the U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as stated in the statement of the Foreign Ministry.
The United States wants to ensure that people from this "north triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a reception station for apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. "Sandra," which was born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986, was granted the rights of a "non-human person," which is why her release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as attorney Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles," formerly a pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" still has to endure a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, USA.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal protection workers in 2014, helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. A research and education centre for the preservation of biodiversity is to be established there by 2023.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride at the almost 3000 meter high Grand Pewter in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-meter-high North Face of the Great Pewter in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute deception, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he undermined the old best mark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, US sporting goods manufacturer Nike posted a significant increase in profit, with net profit rising to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (just under 1.3 billion euros), 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct," with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike sales increased most strongly in China with a 22 percent increase. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the US state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to direct consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
CFO Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to push forward the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors responded with satisfaction to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a life-long ban on a fan. The defenseman Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the account of the fans at Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters were never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that's very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist songs at the first league party between talanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
The Italian authorities now have 38 fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police reported. For the rest, therefore, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups around Juventus. Among other things, the twelve are accused of heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders should be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - whole vintages are considered with grippy names. If one looks more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective feeling of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" On September 21st, the shrimp catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun officially started with this call, which also marked the opening of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothill of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields." The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started the cultivation of crabs in the early 1990s. In the course of time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that provided for high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as technology-based crab farming. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services" and has carefully developed the service network for "licenses under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending," which aims to fully optimise the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the local benefits of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and exploits the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a flagship location for intelligent high-end production plants, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, the cultural and health sector, as well as organic farming companies that are leading in the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national, all-territory tourism zone and tourist resorts of national importance. In this context, the environmental and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape have been integrated, the state of buildings for civic services and for public services have been improved, the areas of tourism +" and "+ tourism" have developed vigorously and the development of cultural tourism has been promoted to a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the US: Ruhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, on his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the United States to lift sanctions. In return, the United States would have envisaged an end to all sanctions for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani stated on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump disagreed with Iran's counterpart on Twitter: "I Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had called for a meeting to take place. "And America says I'm lifting the sanctions," Ruhani added. The type of sanctions that should be ended has been discussed. "And they have clearly said we're lifting all sanctions."
However, Ruhani criticised this move in an acceptable way. In view of the current sanctions and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure," no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Like Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After the western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the concern for a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. On Thursday, the magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to use a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored again and again. Each year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other things, the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered as places of refuge in the center, have long since been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the Thursday quake lay in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and at about seven kilometers depth, according to the civil protection authority Afad. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu reported on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. TRT state station showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried as seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian soil plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, when the earthquake occurs is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything needed to stand next to house doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake comes, is unclear.
After his return from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings were shaking. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday's, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the quake is 1.59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the civil protection agency Afad informed already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," Ersoy said to the transmitter. "The big quake will come sooner or later."
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In addition, there had only been a violent earthquake in Albania a few days ago - there were 68 wounded. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had given birth.
Parliament: New ignition substance in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide a new fuel in the Ukraine affair for the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible removal of power, the U.S. Democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous whistleblower and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president shed important light on investigations against the President. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt." He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - airplane redirected
Because a passenger was detained in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the 1554 flight, the airline reported according to US media.
During an off-scheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. About an hour she was locked up in it, wrote U.S. media citing other passengers. Passengers had to change the plane for the further flight to San Francisco.
In a video broadcast on the Internet, which is supposed to come from Flight 1554 according to US media, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We're currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. It was open at first whether the woman gets a compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation," British success writer Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published on November 27 in German, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) informed. It deals with the transformation of a man called "Jim Sams," who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is determined to let nothing and nobody stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When the parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions are begging for the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." By McEwan, the novel "Machines like me" had only appeared in the spring on artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first story published in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into a tremendous vermin," is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are equipped with whisper brakes to reduce noise from freight trains. In addition, sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility."
Thomas Cook: All travel canceled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all travel until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be started "for reasons of insolvency law," the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin brands, which are already paid for or are fully paid for. The company left open how it is about travel with start from November 1, 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the grip of the British parent company's bankruptcy and filed an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, among others, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money to hotels now
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, are to receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson of the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travelers are not asked by these hotels for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise required," said speaker Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay their own accommodations on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return journey of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution to the future.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the road. Thomas Cook customers who are still planning to fly on holiday look bad. On late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travel until and including October 31 would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that are already paid.
The company left open how it is about travel with start from November 1, 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure is examined, it said. Basically, the insurance company Zurich is responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance company Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. On the Kaera website, customers could find out about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa, he is now walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, the British Prince Harry, dressed in a blue splinter-proof vest, set fire to and destroyed an explosive mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he produced the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive body exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same warden who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go the way she went back then. The paintings on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Sticking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear commitment: with him there will certainly not be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made in the polarizing British for an eternity? The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Britain floats like a Damocles' sword over the Blondskopf. His suspension of parliament in order to be able to carry out his Brexit course stubbornly until the exit date was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to bring about an extension of bilateral talks until 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had categorically excluded this time and again.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure doesn't seem to pass Johnson. Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, he hinted that in the event of a disagreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is gradually running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without any agreement. However, the recent talks have not made a breakthrough either. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister fails to comply with the law, a new postponement of the exit date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authority: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has increased to twelve. Moreover, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, reported the US health authority CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine," there have already been more than 900 sufferers, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. So far, no similar increase in lung damage is known in Europe. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali's videos have been shared millions of times in online networks, and the Spanish builder and actor demands a "people's revolution." For Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with a million participants in the country's central places.
At any rate, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Kairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were closed. Already in the past few days the police had strengthened their street controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partly searched for messages and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, protests had taken place with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported on the basis of lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo has blocked websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013, after he had overthrown democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox from Greenland expedition back
The polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. Upon his arrival at the port of Hamburg, he was greeted by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malia."
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He has waited for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often takes place with the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone of Greenlandic glacier ice had been measured and fished with nets according to microplastics, they said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans," the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the last decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for noodles 430 Euro
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: Two Japanese tourists seemed too much. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases are detrimental to Rome's reputation. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promptly. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified themselves the local owner. However, this is not to be seen from the invoice. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the innkeeper said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an impeachment procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks before a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy. The accusation of the whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint, is monstrous: the president had abused the power of his office in order to instrumentalize the government of another country for influencing the election of 2020. He had used the dependence of Ukraine extorted and thus wanted to force them to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full text. However, the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in whose center next to Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From a public point of view, history begins in May 2019 when the New York Times reports by Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyy, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation for which we have the right," he says to the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal about it." Giuliani wants investigations to be followed in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have infected themselves with right-wing fantasies of conspiracy, which are fixed on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, said critics at the time to construct an occasion for the Russia investigations in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation Trump will be talking about on the phone with Selenskyy in July. The version of Giuliani and the President is: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's representative for the Obama administration, has called for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, on whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior has extorted Ukraine financially in order to cover up the corrupt activities of his family.
When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General go, the investigation of the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Moreover, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behaviour, the US government was by far not the only Western partner pushing for his release. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation of the company.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain in particular are affected. On the website alledörungen.de users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 3.30 p.m. again and again. Instagram also gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the malfunction, though not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by interference
It is not the first massive incident this year. As early as March and July, the services had been cancelled for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also use Twitter this time primarily to vent their anger.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were on a dinghy and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in disaster - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the news, at just before ten we started, and 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER wirelessly charging
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have just come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - first of all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging wirelessly, the researchers have measured over 30 degrees even with the perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly beside the coil, the temperature rises even higher. Furthermore, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also doesn't last that long overall. Thus, the lifespan is lower. The researchers therefore advise to charge the smartphone always by cable. Since a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of a battery exchange - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient:Just place the device on an appropriate charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and laborious plug fummelei. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which even Apple participates in exceptional cases, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau-Photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, his expedition organizer informed.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible." He has already made international headlines: From him comes a photo of mountaineers who are standing on the line on Mount Everest in the spring.
The image of mass demand triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest peaks of the earth. In May eleven climbers had died in the climbing within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. Among other things, bad weather is mentioned as the reason. At the beginning of week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China in order to enable him to ascend.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman told on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists earlier rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously remained harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
According to estimates, there are only about 7,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka.
United Kingdom Oil Tank Leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its establishment by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the Maritime Office of Bandar Abbas announced this. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the British-flagged tanker on 19 July under the charge of disregarding regulations of the Law of the Sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Criticism
The responsible economic committee of the lower house wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. It is about the salary packages of the board of directors as well as the question, why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the company fighting for survival. "Our interest applies to supervision in the company as well as control by external accountants," said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "Our concern is obviously to deal with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
The role of genes in the family increased colorectal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are therefore probably more severe than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek." The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to get the cars to the customers quickly. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price hasn't increased so much in almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value to date.
Musk needs records to reach its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and upcoming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Does British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restrained
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about the possibility of circumventing the last law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a question to this effect, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by the law in force.
The law states that if no agreement was reached with the EU by mid-October, the government should apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law to the period after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran seems to be moving up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani increased pressure on European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said at a press conference on Thursday on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they were not in line with their promises, he proposed "further steps" away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US stepped out of the agreement on its own in order to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now again relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently reacted to this with a re-enrichment of the uranium enrichment limited by the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or prepared uranium for use in the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges according to IAEA data.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rohani suspected. However, there would still be further talks, which hopefully would bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the situation has changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen, supported by Iran, had committed themselves to the attack, which was considered by the US to be a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must present evidence of this," Rohani said. However, the European leaders could not have done so during the talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would only have claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration had to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He called on the Washington government to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was first achieved. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The far-traveled comet was discovered on 30 August by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object that was spotted during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a foreign solar system before it never disappears again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which lies at this distance clearly above the typical speeds of objects that orbit the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is on the way on a so-called hyperbelly track that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which had initially been led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received from it the name 2I/Borisov, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in the approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. A team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object to be 2 to 16 kilometres in an initial investigation. Pictures of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our colleague, de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such trippers are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency intends to deploy the three-part "Comet Interceptor" space probe (for example, comet interceptors) at a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is either to wait for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or to an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
On time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, China United Airlines' first passenger aircraft landed on the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are expected to be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it is expected to be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's most recent prestigious project is also called "sea star" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new metro transports passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, and much smaller, has been postponed until now. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed already after four years.
New supersonic aircraft is scheduled to fly in 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of this. This flight, planned for the 2030s at supersonic speed, is intended to make possible a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire developed, quoted the agency from the US channel CNN. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said agency director Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to 2003 and took three to three and a half hours to complete it. In 2000, an accident occurred at the launch of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, U.S. aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X Plane," together with the U.S. Space Agency Nasa. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable creaming devices."
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine's affair
In the Ukraine affair about potential abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump said on Thursday in front of U.S. embassy staff at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past they were "a little different" from today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tippers. Actually, the event was not public. However, several US media spread audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations on Tuesday for an impeachment trial against Trump. Their accusations are based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. At great public pressure, the whistleblower's descriptions were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials, according to which the US President "takes advantage of the power of his office" to ensure that another country intervenes in his favor in the U.S. election 2020.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the lead in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine telephone: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been prepared. However, this had been removed from a normal database after the discussion at the instruction of lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a particularly protected system. So far only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was an employee of the foreign intelligence agency CIA.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote among other things that the so-called whistleblower had distributed second-hand information that had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there might be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have reportedly reported to the whistleblower, however, there was outrage. Nancy Pelosi, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, reacted anxiously and lamented that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives various investigations against Trump and its surroundings have been underway in various committees for months. In the face of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now conducting investigations with new force in order to launch a possible dismissal procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a schedule for our investigation," said Adam Schiff, head of the intelligence committee at the House of Representatives. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of a misrepresentation of things and again called for the resignation of the chairman of the committee. Trump regularly insults ship and demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. security and foreign policy officials, most of whom were among democratic but also Republican presidents, backed the Democratic-led investigation into a possible removal process in a statement published on Friday. If the allegations were true, Trump said it would be "a ruthless abuse of power."
With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try an impeachment procedure, but the decision to remove their office would be taken in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Thus, the prospects for success of such a procedure are limited. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being "slowly" reduced
The VW brand's plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros from ten billion euros by 2023. Of these, 500 million euros will be saved this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be reduced at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which are not really subject to disposition, are "sneaking" by another way - that is, bypassing the official course. Thus, regular vacancies would often not be refilled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility to force the re-employment. In many cases, staff, the work compaction increases, the worries about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants become greater. This also increases the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide even more and centrally manage new projects. This also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. At a management conference in Berlin, Production Director Andreas Tostmann said: "In uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
This way there are already successes: this year, for example, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not state exact figures on the production period, according to our newspaper, it amounts to around 7 in Golf.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg parent plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-internal applies the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year, so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel and the problems with the changeover to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas testing process.
As Tostmann announced last year, Wolfsburg's production director, however, is supposed to be "perspectively" rolling a million cars off the belt. This is supposed to make it possible to bundle the golf production at the parent plant - because the Zwickau plant delivers the golf production through the conversion to the location for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now resting on Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, it is intended to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: Dealers Condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been vows, have been sent to the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and imprisonment in Bochum on Friday for up to eight years and three months. The defendants had sent young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the Nigerians who wanted to leave the country had still to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought by Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats across the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. When they arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to cover the alleged cost of smuggling an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the entry and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were really disgusted."
The verdicts refer to the entry of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm's ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the flight attendant union Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "information about the labor struggle measures in the LH Group on 14 October," Ufo's tariff director Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining negotiations with the Ufo for months. This also concerns the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal. "I consider it unlikely that a second court sees the matter completely differently," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Landarbeitsgericht Frankfurt in order to have the status of a union reviewed by a court. The company argues that the union has not set up a representative board for months and is thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
This was followed by a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had suspended a preliminary vote on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors is expected to increase to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is an historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed dramatically, oil prices were rising. It is likely to take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colourful, banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the "yes" word a year ago in a New York registry office. There wasn't a bigger festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two of them had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in the event of a plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had sent out an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use during the search. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash location is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of the cities are also the causes of the threat, reported the IUCN World Conservation Union on Friday in Brussels. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these occur on no other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of risk and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "dangered," "strongly endangered," "threatened from extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct." Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Boasting rowan and wild horse chestnut
One of the authors, David Allen, said the German Press Agency, was particularly at risk in Germany. "Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or due to the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "dangerous" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan miniermotte next to a mushroom. It has spread from Southeast Europe all over the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and moss also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs and snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the reports, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian soil plates.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, the epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday a quake of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was insanely excited to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020 it will be time in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - back then she saw Diana Ross flying to the sky at the mid-term show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She couldn't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
In an explanation, Shakira pointed out that she was honored to be on one of the biggest stages in the world alongside another artist and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "Queen" were on stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently dropped audience numbers: This February the spectacle attracted the fewest spectators in the USA for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
Around the mid-term show of the past Super Bowl there had been uproar in advance: In the dispute over the handling of Quarterback Colin Kaepernick did not want to appear last February according to top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the reviews were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone to his knees in the 2016-17 season in front of NFL games in protest against police violence and racism. Kaepernick triggered a movement with his protest, many players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly Afro-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been disunited since March 2017 and has no longer contested any NFL party. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to find the bust of travel provider Thomas Cook expensive. There is a risk of high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down a total of up to £1.8 billion (about €2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds. Actually, the amounts to be written off are likely to be at the upper end of the range, said one expert to the paper.
The extent to which the creditors' losses will actually be in the end will become apparent after the insolvency proceedings have expired. A person close to this procedure did not give up too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in bad situations. The most money one could probably get out with the sale of the airport slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't have any secure information," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of rape, torture and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the detention centre in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they let on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally taken migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29, and hit a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects arrived there. The captain is being investigated for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," Pai said to the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," said the FCC CEO. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to require suppliers to provide a "confidence statement."
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not consist only of hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," continues the FCC boss.
To the Chinese company Huawei he makes close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationships are opaque. The employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the "Handelsblatt."
The US would have learned that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the US.
Chemistry Factory in Northern France Burns: Schools Closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall illuminates the sky over a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not open on Friday, the responsible prefecture informed. The Interior Ministry had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the deletion smell spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 policemen and gendarmes were in use at the fireplace.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously emerged from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the Normandy factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976 a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso near Milan, Italy.
The Prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river dams were built against pollution, the Prefecture explained.
The fire broke out in the early morning around 2.40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause was initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany has to invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The eurozone economy was weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse in order to make the necessary decisions."
Those states that have budgetary scope for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, and referred to the high level of public debt in its country. This is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilized" and "downed," said Le Maire.
In recent years, appeals have come from France to Germany to make more public investments to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is thus reacting, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson eludes question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "capitulation law" adopted by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician deviates from this possibility.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, keeps his mind on whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law passed by Parliament, which is intended to prevent exactly that. On a question to this effect, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law in force.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU has been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law to the period after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way to do so is with an agreement."
Meanwhile, Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings explained that he felt the political disputes surrounding Brexit as a "walking in the park" and was confident that the desired EU exit would come about: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will quit (note: Red.: from the EU), don't worry," said Cummings at a book presentation, according to the British newspaper "Telegraph."
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 election campaign before the EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in the British government seat Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Pockets) plunges deeply into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Among the illustrious guests were also Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film."
The camera was always there with Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her way to photography. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of which are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries."
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the center of attention: her husband Paul - as you might never have seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a normal life beyond the spotlight on her farm in southern England or Scotland. Mary McCartney said, according to BBC, that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made out of old potato boxes. And it wasn't always tidyed up with the McCartneys either.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the essay.
The light, the composition, the image section and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to everything anecdotal, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road," which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite US sanctions against Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "retreated because of US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, particularly on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. Tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of State stated that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a cut of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the main task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as stated in the statement of the Foreign Ministry. However, a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The programme, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps all over the world and relocates to the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current ceiling of 30,000 is a low level. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted horribly to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee. The US would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States, both legally and illegally. According to the United States government, 350,000 asylum applications are expected for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Comes Close to a Spy"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever has given appropriate evidence to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a spy," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several US media reports agree.
As a result, Trump spoke to employees of the US UN mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This is coming close to a spy." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers rated the latter remark as a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. Moreover, it was an attempt to obstruct a congress inquiry into a possible dismissal procedure against him, wrote the chairman of the committees for foreign affairs, secret services and supervision in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office in order to ask for interference from another country in the US election in 2020. Specifically, his controversial telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyy in the summer is about him: In the conversation, Trump encouraged him to investigate his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Time and again, people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. The often too small boats captivate regularly. When a dinghy is destroyed, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed when a dinghy was killed. Among the deaths were a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could thus be saved from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in too small boats. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year.
The Who Breaks Up Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of an insatiability of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed the service. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it's still going on."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey "can't really speak now." Townsend promised the audience that he would get his money's worth at a reparation concert. However, an appointment has not yet been made.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver planned appearances, The Who canceled. They are to be made up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear billions of revenues.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. A few days ago the company had dismissed founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork hires large office space in the long term and rents it to members in small units at short notice. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money at breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company suffered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs by renting ever new large areas are estimated to have increased to 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is now supposed to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded tenancy contracts with a term of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, over the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone have ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly launched areas in that time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider." Similarly, it looks like in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in the best position.
Even in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis purchased last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the billions of revenues hoped for. They do not have access to WeWork's reserves, which are already scarce, despite the long-term rental contracts. As a rule, the rental of the individual WeWork sites is carried out by subsidiary companies, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia once again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested who have been illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian Domestic Intelligence Service FSB of the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time, it was said, there were no casualties. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. According to their own information, the Russian coastguard patrols to protect their marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered. In addition, according to three fishing and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, in 2018 the coast guard found a total of more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there temporarily in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained about high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrowly meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small organisms out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be disassembled. Also the ships themselves do not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the last week's arrests. According to the FSB, one North Korean, who was also wounded, later died of his injuries. Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat on September 17 and then a second boat after it opened the fire.
USA impose entry ban on ex-President Castro
The US has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the US Department of Foreign Affairs stated in a statement on Thursday with Castro's participation in "serious human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he is in charge of a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had banned entry on Wednesday, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle has been raging for months between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro's government to force him down and to force the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. Venezuela's Socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of doctors sent to Venezuela. According to the US and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the road today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are expected to start due to the time shift before the protests spread over Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada. Also in front of the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
It is relatively unclear how great the worldwide response this Friday will be after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people have been on strike for the climate. We will do it again this Friday," she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, the people want to go on the road for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. The Fridays-for-Future movement has emerged within a short period of time. Students and students are mainly involved in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just over a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a high-sea racing yacht, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN in which she strongly condemned the heads of state and government of the world. In her homeland of Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, according to the agency Tass. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, therefore, must count on a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty falls higher. According to the ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Even grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Impact against cybercriminals - Investigators take out servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal transactions on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through the internationally acting criminals.
Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a big action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market," which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million Deutsche Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General's office.
Such a hoster was first excavated in Germany, it said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
During the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 there were searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests Who are Thunberg's backers?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl holds the mirror in front of the power-man of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and causes young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was also able to win over a group of young people and persuade them to cross the sea to enter the promised land, similar to Greta Thunberg recently set out on the trip to America with a sailboat.
Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold extensively, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also, well-proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick on some successors. This is also not unsubstantiated, because the action came out very well in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here, the spirits are separated: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue action? No matter which position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question even seemingly pious intentions of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The conjectures of astronomers have been confirmed: At the moment a strange comet crosses our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employed by astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked up to heaven with a self-made telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that, astronomers will be able to observe it closely, because, unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua."
First insights into comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our colleague, de León's colleague Javier Licandro, added.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid passed the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
It becomes lonelier around Boris Johnson. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges with clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as "flavorless." It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation," "fraud," contract: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to prepare - at least verbally. During Question Time in the House of Commons on this Wednesday, there was massive indignation from the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have spoken up: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hunged, pulled, quartered, tarred and feathered." She considered this extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had competed in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK."
In particular, she came across the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly Member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum. It was best to honour their memory by going through the Brexit that Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to refer to a member of parliament who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," Johnson's sister now criticized. The perpetrator obviously came from the far-right camp, which feels encouraged by 'this kind of language'. For all who mourned for her, it was very distasteful.
The widower of Cox also sharply criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor it is to stand up passionately and decisively for what you believe - no matter what you think, but never to "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned from his position as Secretary of State and tory deputy. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. According to the Times, all 118 Bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticized the language that "is not worthy of this country." In a joint statement, they stated: "In recent days, language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL sets a strong mark: In the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots, promising "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming US Football League NFL final, announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2nd in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she ended up with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be shown in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever."
The announcement of the mid-term guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time. This year, many also value the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch at the NFL finale, it is now also extremely popular in Germany.
The reason for this was the dispute over the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up when playing the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks, and who had been attacked hard by US President Donald Trump, among other things. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber assigns Egypt's ruler: For the time being Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood is flowing again on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them floated again at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 dismissed the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state in the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had vowed Sisi's action against political Islam and did not lose a syllable of the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week when Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they dared to protest against the President. He "has no cause for concern," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television. "The Egyptians are not going astray."
According to the president, the other man who is currently determining what is happening on the streets is trying to mislead. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, avoiding the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice who dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tearooms: with his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets," Ali calls his compatriots to stand up against Sisi.
While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and lets himself be built magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that's the impression of many Egyptians, as the virtually exploding click figures show.
After thousands of people, including prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested for the first time since Sisi's grip on power, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would dare to march on the streets. However, there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not be verified independently at first. Security circles said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters tore banners with the president's portrait into pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the downtown streets. Several underground stations in Cairo were closed for "maintenance work," most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, where in 2013 supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Mursi were entrenched until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent unsatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's future party wanted to hold a large rally for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Don't let us collide with police officers." But as a retreat, this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not have to trust the speed data of the providers blindly. Customers can themselves check how much of it is actually achieved in case of anomalies.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bayern Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the agreed rate in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," says the Bayern Consumer Centre on its side to consider.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable deadline of usually 14 days in order to produce the promised service. This is best done in writing by enrollment.
If this does not work even after several requests, customers can cancel and may also demand damages. However, if failure to succeed, only the way of action will help.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken out in favour of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here is determined by the facts found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the President - is taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in a telephone call to investigate interventions by the Democratic candidate for the presidency and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Trump observed Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort about it. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policies several times, for example, against the easing of environmental legislation and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home." Several U.S. media report this in agreement. According to this, the theatrical release is already scheduled: The film is scheduled to start in the U.S. on July 16, 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quotes Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige: "I am pleased that Spidey's path will continue in MCU. I and all of the Marvel studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verses. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would participate in the revenue of Spider-Man films with 30 percent. However, the news is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
One thing: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed once again the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown himself over a robe, the dumb-ass Harvey wants to know from the groom, only to note snippyly: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat crash
A baby and four other children drowned while a refugee boat was in the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the disaster, as the Greek coast guard reported on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he will visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to "information on the situation of refugees" in Turkey, said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help in dealing with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the EU Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned journey with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister of the Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, said the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased figures raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which allows the EU to send back all refugees and migrants illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to receive a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications on the Greek side is only arduous due to lack of personnel. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people are waiting for Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5,200 Migraten are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, there have been so many, the state radio reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to medical experts, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Above all, the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time to create and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green CEO holds a reusable cup in his hand in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been quite a long time unnoticed - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the boss of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee mug with metal straw. On the party's website she was seen in a photo with this mug, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and distributed to the media - and there was still a dreary (app) mug, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green boss has to answer for photo breach
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the Fake News party produced to be more credible on the subject of "environmental protection," and this in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau, too, has become increasingly difficult due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and opened the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cup."
May was shocked and exclaimed on her blog that she didn't know about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, who, she correctly put it, was made of bamboo. She always had it there. A spokesperson of the party said that it was only a matter of placing the party logo in the picture, and not of covering up something. There is only one section of the photo on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked for something from her over-engaged team: "If they want to work on a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face so that I look younger?"
The German Greens have also fallen into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or flight travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
According to Cathay Pacific, Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by mail. However, when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at check-in offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
This case shows, however, how not to do it: A self-declared influencer actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram Jaqueline Ng follow more than 65,000 users. On 30 May she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
On the way out, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline even though she showed an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered her an upgrade. The letter wants to have the influencer received from an airline's marketing staff member. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having falsified the mail.
On the return flight Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman showed the same mail, however, with another reference number. The employees at the airport JFK were sceptical: they were following up at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail was supposed to originate denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros) they had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms and conditions state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices give way to ceasefire in Yemen, according to report
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Last, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen was the trigger for the course slide. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world's oil production to an end. Huthi rebels in Yemen, allied with Iran, claimed the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
Should an agreement be reached, one could concentrate on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Department of Raw Materials Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
The oil prices continue its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Most recently, on the basis of Insider, Bloomberg reported that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had progressed faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and was moving back towards the original quantity.
Most recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting rapid progress by Saudi Aramco, a state-owned oil company in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a public offering and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recently issued release to leave the port. The crew is now preparing to leave while the ship is still anchored, shipping director Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the US announced that it would transfer defence missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom had caused oil prices to rise significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are intensifying
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several senior government officials have made an intense effort to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The spokesperson of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "covering." Trump spoke of a "witch hunt."
North Korea considers third Trump and Kim summits to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon lead to a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the advisor to the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticized US sanctions and the US and South Korea's joint military manoeuvres. However, he hoped for Trump's "wise" and "courageous" decision to bring things closer together again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know only what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have stalled since the failed second Trump and Kim summit in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarised zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers should help with mine clearance
In Angola, the British Prince Harry symbolically lit and destroyed an explosive mine. Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he set the ignition circuit. The explosive body exploded at a safe distance. With a view to getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to clear the way to help."
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British Pound under Pressure
In the face of an early reduction in interest rates, the pound loses its value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations on an early interest rate reduction by the Bank of England (BoE) increase the pound sterling. The British currency declined by up to 0.4 percent on Friday to 1.2269 dollars.
The trigger of the sales was statements by the central banker Michael Saunders. This led to a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered to be an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy of the Brexit hickhack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on October 31, if necessary.
More: The British Prime Minister took a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details on the doping scandal in Russia are emerging - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and even only in its initial stages. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports had been revealed, and the Vada had closed the Russian Anti-Oping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had about 270 athletes competed in the country under a neutral flag, and in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes took part in the Winter Games. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, and in summer Russia even hosted the World Cup.
There are no positive findings
The following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada-Bann again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information about the scope of cover-up of doping cases in the state doping. They should help to punish athletes subsequently. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have detected numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower, and those that received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that had been mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This is confirmed by the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to hold on to the banner of Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were exercising outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Vada had already put manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the new lock of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
