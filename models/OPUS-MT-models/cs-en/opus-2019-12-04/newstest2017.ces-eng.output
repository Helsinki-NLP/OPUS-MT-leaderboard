Twenty-three-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
A 27-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the steps of the local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, and he says, "He's finally doing well."
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, listed as a medical examiner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was a former chefs in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that his death was "shocked and destroyed."
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss him very much," said the speaker.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and grief belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the dormitories, but that he had recently "finally started to thrive."
"He found an apartment, dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be a part of any fight.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that lit up every day," he said.

ČD invested more than 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, state carriers have invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, fall gradually.
In the last six years, ČD has invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent showed a two-year reduction in average age for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was made by the carrier in regional transport, where around 60% of the money was directed, 40% then invested in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
In the absence of vehicle modernisation, the average driving age of ČD vehicles would increase by 10 years.
A little older are, on average, personal wagons whose average age is 23 years when netting modernization.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
In recent years, the classic sets consisting of wagons and towed by the locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways and have been replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive decreased from 280 to 223 pieces, as did the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was mainly rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments that ČD plans to make in the vehicle park in the near future, it is possible to indicate, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or the framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic express lines.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 motor and 20 electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year now, the editorial office of the online daily News News News is watching the story of the billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where not only is a tourist walk in the trees, but also the Olympic park.
Highway managers know they're standing there in the dark, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of similar ads all over the country.
According to the officials, there is a flimsy law against which it is impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complex bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
In the meantime, the company will change its name, and the office is short on it.
Or maybe just move the ad a few yards, and the official process has to start over.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main move from České Budějovice to Lipno, the advertising billboard stands on our property near the state road.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's like nobody cares that he's standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers say they can't handle the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe load him up and drive him away.
"We must not afford this," says the spokesperson for the Road and Motorways, Nina Ledvin, and refers to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must, by law, prevent.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to follow the news daily in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
Likewise, there are other counties.
"We have difficulty forcing the company to remove the beacons," confirms the head of the transport department of the Czech-Budějovice Regional Office Jiří Klása, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klása, the leaky law that binds officials is to blame.
First, he has to address the owner of the billboard in a difficult way to put the ad away.
But corporate bosses are often hard to reach or know the trick that was already described in the past when he became more interested in the issue: just move the mobile advertising stand a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertising in the trash.
That's because the Bureau has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we must contact the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could be brought by a new law that will ban billboards from motorways from September next year and limit them to first class roads.
Critics point out that the rules on combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as they have been before.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens of millions of crowns per year on the rental of illegal areas and no one can touch them.
For example, the billboard that lures Lipno belongs to the company Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech-Budějovice Magistrate is currently conducting three administrative proceedings for black billboards.
There's a $300,000 fine in every trial.
These are multiple advertisements which were located without permission in the protection zone of the first class road.
The proceedings are not yet completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the Czech-Budějovice Municipality.
The advertising he is interested in is not yet included in these cases, but will soon be added to them.
According to HSY spokesperson Nina Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for elimination, thus bringing the case to the regional table and then possibly to the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
She's not taking over the post office, and she canceled her office in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company went to the South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose Euro Billboard rents and offers the area from Comerz Billboard to advertisers, has rejected any connection in the past.
Meanwhile, this spring, when HSY began to be interested in Lipno advertising, Fischer had civil servants send a letter to the mysterious company, Commerz Billboard, where the new company is supposed to be based.
However, no one has ever heard from the highway managers from this address.
A futile struggle.
Similar silences or opaque changes in mansions are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gave a company tickets for two million crowns.
But she changed the name and the ICO, and there was nothing to deal with.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads kept going, maybe in other places.
We're pretty helpless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, under the condition that one of the officials admits anonymity.
The amendment to the law in this regard has not yet been addressed.
At the same time, he spoke to several Members who were interested in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards for major Czech communications.
The government turned it down.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for national but also for regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they need them themselves for advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stand for the rather established impression that when something doesn't work, laws need to be changed.
Farmers harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, estimated by the statistic.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop exceeds the average in the last five or ten years.
On the other hand, the rapeseed harvest (by 3.9%) and poppy (2.5%) will be higher.
Cereal harvesting will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This follows from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a decimal decline against last year.
But last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average in the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the rapeseed and poppy harvest will be higher this year.
Rape growers reap 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1.256 million tonnes under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decline in cereal production is due to both a reduction in the yield of the hectares by 3.7% to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a drop in the area.
Farmers have sown three percent less fields this year.
The winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3% less this year.
Meanwhile, the farmers planted it in more fields.
However, a lower yield per hectare will be signed in decline, which will fall to 6,04 tonnes.
Around one-fifth of the fall in statistics is expected for spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The reduction in crop area is due to a reduction of 15.2%, but also to a lower yield per hectare.
On the contrary, the winter barley is born 6.3% more.
The harvest of rye will also grow.
Rape production is estimated at 1,305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The area has increased by 7.3%.
But the hektar yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed crop exceeds the 10-year average by 13.3%, while it is sown on an area a third larger than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, the poppy fields have also increased.
This year, the farmers sank him at 35.543 hectares.
But half of the fields are against 2008, when poppy was grown in the Czech Republic on record 70 000 hectares.
This year's poppy harvest will be richer thanks to the expansion of the seed areas.
It will rise against last year by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons.
But the hektar yield is going to be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police have charged two men with knife and machete assault, the court has sent them into custody.
Police have accused two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in downtown Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the defendant tried to escape, they caused him a cut and cut wound which required treatment at the hospital and further treatment," said Police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
Both obvious offenders were apprehended immediately after the attack by the police.
The plaintiff filed a motion to take them into custody, and the court granted him his order on Friday.
Both men are facing three to ten years in prison.
Police have accused two detainees of assaulting a 35-year-old man in downtown Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The assailants caused him cuts and cuts, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place on Tuesday at noon at the Liberty class, reported by the police.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed Olomouc police spokesperson Marie Strábáková.
A mass scuffle between two families took place in the garden area outside the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After aggressive verbal discord, two assailants attacked with a knife and a machete of a 35-year-old male.
Although the man who was attacked tried to escape, they caused him an incision and incision wound, which required treatment at the hospital and further treatment, she stated a police spokesperson.
In a scuffle that raised a lot of attention in the city centre, and for which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the scene, it was a family dispute.
Criminalists accused a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc of attempting serious harm and disorderly conduct.
The plaintiff filed a motion to take them into custody, and the court granted him on Friday, adding a spokesperson.
The machete was used in the centre of Olomouc by the assailants five years ago, it was only a few tens of meters away, before the Varna discotheque on Rieger Street.
At the time, the police said that a group of approximately ten aliens with guns attacked the guests of the company who were standing outside the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two foreign assailants with conditional punishment.
Abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, you may pass them every day.
One of the most blatant examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Senovážné Square.
It should have been a hotel by now.
Still nothing.
That new apartments and offices need to be built in the metropolis?
And what about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the centre of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several tenement houses which, despite their location, size and often even monument protection are only desolate and empty.
We have selected properties in the centre using the project Holiday Domy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that cannot or will not get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than there are homeless.
Let the owners pay a special tax on them, they want the initiative

Mr. and Mrs. Clinton made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year.
They gave over a million dollars to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton's income - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
US Democrats' candidate for Hillary Clinton's presidency released their tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on their Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP Agency.
Most of Clinton's income - over $6 million - is for their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husbands paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by an income tax of nine percent at the state and local level.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of the income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with such a move, so he has not yet decided to publish his tax return.
There's a chance that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton posted a twitter a few minutes after she released her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrets surrounding Trump's income, among other things, in order to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is indeed as rich as she claims, the AP has stated.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the republican candidate's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for Vice President in tandem with the former First Lady, has today released a report on his tax contributions over the last ten years.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5% of their earnings to charity, and they paid 25.6% of their earnings in taxes last year.
There was polio in Nigeria again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented a thorough vaccination and killed a doctor.
There have been cases of polio in Nigeria again.
In the north-east of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination because there are two children who have been paralyzed by this disease.
Vaccines were transported there by helicopters.
In the affected area there were Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was undetected there.
In the northeast of Nigeria, an extraordinary vaccination of children against polio will begin, because there were paralysis of two children infected with this disease.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in the states surrounding it.
On Friday, Nigerian military helicopters, according to AP, quickly transported polio vaccines to the affected northeast part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that the virus has been circulating in the area for many years.
In the past, the extremists of Boko Haram defended vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to get to areas where polio children were detected on Thursday.
Both disabled toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO section responsible for eradicating polio, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC station that the vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram worked for a long time.
The area was only made available to international organisations and the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigerian health minister Isaac Adewole admitted that new polio cases are a great disappointment to the country, because next year Nigeria wanted to announce that polio was eradicated.
The WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease had not occurred for two years, it was still spreading among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all polio cases in the world accounted for Nigeria.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it is now only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and in the north of Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the twisted stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their hard life stories and encouraged them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes in Rome who were freed from the power of a gang of pimps.
For more than an hour, the head of the Catholic Church listened to the fickle stories of fallen women and subsequently called on them to look to the future with confidence, the Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes František visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and after one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
According to the Vatican, they were all subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
By visiting František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against him, said the Pope's spokesman.
František often draws attention to the fate of people on the outskirts of society.
For example, on Thursday, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican this April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will hit the jihadists' factories.
But it won't work without the help of the Muslims.
Muslims themselves are supposed to help France in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valls' government is preparing fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and spiritual education.
Since last December, we closed 20 mosques and prayers.
And others will follow, announced by the Home Secretary.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state to fight those who undermine public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer houses.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20% of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, most of Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is also why preachers who can sow radicalism in France get into mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," added the Prime Minister.
The new French Islamic Foundation will be the key to ensuring that these objectives are met.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam is now in operation in the country, founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the Foundation should have contributed to making the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction more transparent.
But the institution was soon hit by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
On the French political scene, even after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate about a new institution that will replace a dysfunctional foundation was kindled.
It was speeded up by other terrorist attacks in France, carried out by radicalized Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that a new foundation will be created this October.
It will have two main tasks - to provide financing for mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
For the time being, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new mosques, but also different educational centres.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, it would be paid by the Halal food vendor for providing certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation's cash register.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, there are about 30,000 of them going to Saudi Arabia on a traditional pilgrimage.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special education programmes at French universities should operate in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the sermon is consistent with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in a campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, announced recently by the Home Secretary.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are estimated to be around 2500 mosques and prayers in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have exiled around 80 imams and are considering it for several more tens.
But not everyone thinks that government moves can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize themselves will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert from the National Research Center.
Drawman Kelemen lost his first round of sprint to the star Baugé.
The Czech railway cyclists must fight for the advance to the eighth finals in repair rides.
The railway cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics after a procedure from the qualification of the sprint among the top eighteen lost in the first round a duel with the French great Grégory Baugé, a silver advocate of the past games in London.
They have to fight for progress to the eight-finals in repair rides.
27 riders stood up to the start of the royal discipline on the track and the best Czech racer of the present took the 14th best time.
He made a 200 with a flying start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase he was thus expected to qualify as the fifth Baugé, who already has Rio bronze in the team sprint.
Kelemen, while at the end, was tagging at an experienced Frenchman, he kept track of the procedure.
Jason Kenny, the gold defender, was a great performance.
Twenty-three-year-old Brit has run the third fastest 200 history and won 9.551 in the Olympic record.
The German Maximilian Levy was also easily dealt with as expected.
The British quartet in the Bradley Wiggins lineup was also successful, which set a new world record of 3: 50.570 in the 4 km fighter race and advanced to the final.
The maximum (3: 51,659), which belonged to the British four years since the London Olympics, has been improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Young doctors' representatives have gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over a new treaty.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the whole board to support further professional events in early September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the treaty issues.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the contract agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "silent" on questions, a great deal to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC executive body has decided by voting to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA to approve a running programme of escalated trade events in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to announce six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of the young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
The members of the BMA at the pre-election meetings before the 54 000 young doctors and medical students were told that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health said that the treaty would be a burden for medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long-term verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish opposing party into the luxurious palace hall in St Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin was not smiling, and he barely exerted warmth, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, has repeatedly spoken about his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to its level before the crisis, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin has shown that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speech: the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction back then was fierce.
Putin was giving punches around him, and Ankara was accused of sticking a knife in Moscow's back.
The scandal was all the more so because it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russia's public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, state-controlled media has led a massive worldwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it looked like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious were the allegations made by senior state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denies this strongly.
But in St Petersburg, the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only took place because Putin received the apology he requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the ceasefire are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during a failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly also shaken it.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions had a severe impact - particularly the abolition of charter flights, which will transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey each year.
This figure decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies are sure to relax when flights may be resumed.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedomosti newspaper said.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what she considers a poor response to an attempted coup.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about joining the EU and Putin's accession - eager to exploit and break the ties of Turkey and the West.
The Russian leader certainly gained bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after trying to coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it's a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to demonstrate to me what one of the analysts described as an "alliance of the incompatible": how the forces of the two countries that feel rejected and used by the West combine.
But, despite publicly showing reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow was recently a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they did not even mention this issue.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both countries could find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster, when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders at least speak to each other again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of which it was relieved when it nearly disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, the strategy brands used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
However, it has now been decided that it is better to give more distinction to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but it will not start new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more to the forefront - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our trips to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
The BBC station Scotland said: "The RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand that our employees work for because we are now becoming a much more bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, so did RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have domestic efforts.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in its own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of Six Nations Championship, prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"This is a good time for us to move on to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how do we focus on becoming a better customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we said we'd become a great customer bank and introduced those brands.
But along with how we focused on the needs of our customers, and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind you of these signs, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horse Predilection led to the finish of 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory at Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories.
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured a 3000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by his second victory of the evening on his local track - on the horse Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
Forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this result in flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of Dettori, who once won on a horse Ghayyar, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here, too.
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I docked 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when after victory brings Predilection
Two jockeys reached this milestone in the obstacle races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who, during their career breaking records, led more than 4,300 winners to the finish line.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys in modern times, and it's no surprise that he reached a milestone that only a few riders had reached before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical fist that distinguishes it from the other riders in the dragonfly.
He's a fantastic ambassador to racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just ride weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the greater part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a lively personality, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his fabled leap
From the summer finers to the summer jumps - Frankie Dettori has been a delivery boy for the British flat races for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
Many winners of the big races, including his famous "grand seven" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from starting for drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated as he returned after a six-month launch ban, but showed incredible internal strength, and all the doubters, despite returning in the best form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released President Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidency.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
Seventy-three-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "released Ivanov from his service to the head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, will take his place.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno used to be a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that later he was head of the Presidential Protocol and the Presidential Office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as a head of state in terms of draft laws and control of the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin stated on Friday to the Russian television station that Ivanov had asked him to release him from his post and recommended that he replace him with Vajno.
Will he convince the smiles?
This move has been completely mystified by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast by state television, both men declared that he was leaving the post of head of the presidential office at his own request.
But only a few people convinced the camera smiles - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once thought of as a possible president suddenly longs to run Russia's environmental policy has met with great mistrust.
On the Kremlin pages are quoted notes addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to give me this very demanding post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I've been head of the presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the KGB Committee.
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, Ivanov appointed one of his five closest associates.
In fact, it was speculated at the time that Ivanov could succeed Putin at the head of the state after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin's, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister only three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of the "Criminal Thoughts" series, was released after hitting the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
ABC and CBS TV stations that produce the show announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before he was fired.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened, "he said in the statement.
According to ABC and CBS TV stations, the details of the way Gibson's character disappears from a series that watches the stories of an FBI team of agents a little later.
Forty-four-year-old actor, who was famous for his main role in the Dharma and Greg sitcom, has been on the show since the first season of 2005.
"I love Criminal Thoughts, and over the last 12 years I have put heart and soul into them," Gibson said in his statement he issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that's not going to be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series to the 12th season is expected on September 28th.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed fish in the garden
The man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish can be sand eels left behind by a water storm.
Bain, which lives about 500 metres from the sea, on the Periscope channel published a short film of his finding in the belief that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The project for £1.35 billion is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers connected the North Plateau and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is therefore the first of the four closures between the "platform fans," which are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the Fife Bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The project for £1.35 billion is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment to build Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers on an impressive scale used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In place is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, the head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the cutting edge of the building industry.
After the installation of the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expansion platform North Tower, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and it was necessary to drag it up about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters each way.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfrre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being flushed off their fishing boat at Anglesey's.
The Moelfrre RRLI Lifeboat Station has alerted the Friday at 13: 20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident at Moelfrre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued out of control.
"We saw their boat circling near them and we thought of the worst," said the helmsman of Moelfrre Vince Jones's lifeboat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind blew him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life jacket exhausted holding on to the buoys.
They've all been brought aboard a coastal lifeboat and transferred back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had an emergency shut-down line, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the roll-over occurred.
Someone above those boys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to solve the case for Fatty's wife.
Peter Fat is one of the three Members who, according to the indictment, were to receive from Prime Minister Netime and his former cabinet chief, Jana Nagy, a political newsstand, a lucrative post for political concession.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
The Snail, Fuksa and Fatso allowed him to resign.
Then they showed up in powerful positions in state firms.
That's why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were wrongfully compensated for almost CZK 2 million in total.
The fat man now acts as a witness in the case, after the Supreme Court's intervention.
His wife works at the fruit market courthouse and solves civil disputes.
Yet Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful (dealing with criminal matters - note) and to avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another Prague judicial district.
The King has already acquitted Jana Time, formerly Nagy, twice.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to spy on Prime Minister Netime Radka's first wife.
The Fatty wasn't involved in this case.
According to Jaroslav Ortman's lawyer, this is an overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way in order for a court to be ruled out if witnesses have a wife or relatives in a court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge at all, but it's remarked for the journal.
"It seems crazy," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of political shops.
According to his attorney Peter Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 debated the indictment of former Cabinet Chief of Prime Minister Peter Nečas Jana Nagy (today Intimed) and others accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
Images are coming to court with Nimas and her husband.
The fat lady was supposed to be talking about Peroutka.
For example, the ex-Member's wife was to judge President Milos Zeman's statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutk.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl appears to have died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She and her two same-age friends flew to Syria last February from Gatwick airport in London.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on her death.
Young Londoners who fled home, according to police, were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abasa and Kadiza Sultana, according to the media, headed for their next former classmate at Bethnal Green Academy in London.
Last year, the case caused a huge wave of attention and also tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have yet to travel to Syria, of which about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the radicals of IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
The work of dreams for a hundred thousand dollar salary.
A well-paid job that you don't even need college for.
That's what I.T. looks like at first sight.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only for Czech conditions of extremely high salary (in Prague you earn up to 180,000 CZK by working in IT), but also for extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to statistics, the most wanted are Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, the candidates are not competing for a job, but for candidates, Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment, comments.
College is not a necessity.
College education is not necessary for IT.
College education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and education, but it often does not have much in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers have to learn new things all the time, which will not be replaced once by a university, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money is made in Prague.
I.T. wages are everywhere high above the Republic average.
The most money comes to them in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is not so great anymore.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," says Cubacka.
Technical directors will make the highest profits.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also asked.
When boarding, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
Fighting is about alumni.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, IT doesn't apply.
Because if companies get overpaid and overpaid by an expert from another company, they're happy to reach for an alumni.
Because they can raise him on their own terms.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary in IT.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are particularly looking for an educated and experienced person and are satisfied with the average knowledge of English.
For example, if a support worker controls more foreign language, he is interesting for his employer, because he can serve more customers from different countries, the director adds Kubačka.
Yeah, Google, there's paradise.
Only the Czech workers can be quietly envious of Google employees.
Flexible working hours, working from home or various shortened volumes are a matter of course for them, not only for mothers.
"To the newly baked dads, the company provides four weeks extra leave after the birth of the baby," says Martina Jones, spokesperson for Google.
The movement includes health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Who wants to educate is green, and it doesn't matter what new people want to learn.
But that's not the end of the bargain.
Such a full fridge for free is certainly not worth throwing away either.
A healthy lunch (in some locations even breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in all the offices, where people always find healthy snacks, the spokesperson gives away.
And in order for nothing to be thrown out, what they don't eat, they put in boxes that employees can take home at night.
And the reason for these on the Czech conditions of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google to have employees sitting in an office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions," adds the spokesperson.
The UN has strongly criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The Bulgarian Government's official strategy "raises serious concern that Bulgaria does not comply with international law," warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in his statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to see how important and influential public figures express their public support for criminal armed fighting, which are insolently organising refugee hunts at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go to Bulgarian territory in an irregular manner are automatically arrested," said Zeid.
Worse still - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria held 14 000 migrants this year, 21 000 for the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - a search for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Over the last decade, many people have been saying that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer free time to screens.
Pokemon Go picks people up from the couch and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally shrunk on TV, later on video games, and most recently on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside do not exclude each other.
I am talking, of course, about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more were created).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a drop in interest before the introduction of this new game in early July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, the players on the smart phone go out looking for Pokémon, which they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can "take a picture" (via screenshot on the phone) or "catch."
Mania captures the generation that played the game at a younger age, picks it up from the seats and drives out looking for Pokémon.
In the US, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that "average" man does every day.
The Cardiogram app for a smart watch from Apple, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of starting the game, the number of people being watched who practiced every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it sees only rough data on levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns aimed at "finding 30," "getting off the couch," and "being active every day" fell on barren ground, because most public health messages are boring and addressed to people who don't look good.
Nevertheless, the importance of the exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully mention here.
But the beauty of Pokemon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight.
Some people even make new friends in pursuit of pokémon.
As usual, there are, of course, some boring patrons looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can walk in the door.
So what, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
At their time, applications for smart phones, like Fitbit, could track our activity, but they didn't give us any reason to do anything like this game.
The news is looking at it, and the interest in it begins to drop at some point.
But thanks to Pokémon's success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world and will help many people to pursue activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in the multigame of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic to jump.
Easy on the beam.
By the plain, they were all silent.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast took a direct route to a multi-fight title and surpassed the others on a full scale under the Olympic spotlight.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over the silver medalist and team member "final five" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during the presentation on the beam in the finals of the multifight of individuals in sports gymnastics at the summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row who won a multi-fight, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final evaluation was on the board and her long journey to this point ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success places it in the same league of unique athletes of its time, such as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Bilesová has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold pieces. Her stunning lineup is a mixture of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
Her last test was in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than coming home to your family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), on the left, and Aly Raisman are hugging after winning the gold and silver medal in the final female multi-fight of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was the exclamation point at Martha Karolyi's leaving national team coordinator's party.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the top, she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of her routine in the plain - the one that contains a typical triple flip - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, into streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multi-fight contest has not been lost since summer 2013 - a sequence of victories that can continue for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short while with two turns, it was just an illusion.
The beam and the plain - where Biles advocates the world championship - are waiting.
She got back into the lead with 15,433 points for the beam - and she finished with 15,933 points in the plain.
Raisman gently hugged her as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glitter red, white and blue shadows, the Biles appeared tears when the wish she had once written in her diary came true.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but then she ate bronze for the sum of the top three sets.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who Americans call "grandma," was way ahead.
After her simple ones, she sent a crowd of air kisses, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the contribution that this 19-year-old athlete put on Twitter this week, where he became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, being shot sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities have reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot dead on June 12th in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that an armed man was on the passenger side and fired eight shots from a handgun and then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, a robbery isn't worth a triple homicide because the assailant didn't take the wallets or the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Police spokesman in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that investigators are checking to see if the shooting was related to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, nine attacks occurred within four months, killing seven people, and two others injured.
"It's happening in the villa district in front of the houses," said Howard earlier this month for a branch of the CBS KPHO station.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late '90s, a black BMW from the late' 90s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to a hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died at the scene.
The witness told the police it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities have also released a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder.
Investigators found shell casings, and from the bullet residue in the seat, and from under the engine bonnet, they assembled a bullet.
Mother of a six-year-old with microcephalia: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and of course also his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephalia, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you're ready for it, "she said.
She and her husband Vincent have learned that Edmund may never recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do that anymore," explains Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But some of the milestones are already slowly filling.
He walks around with help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and he loves to sing.
Elizabeth is doing a sign speech that Edmund says, "Please sing for me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - it says Edmund made up some of the characters himself.
Microcephalia can occur from a number of different states: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciuto resembles an emotional tax that the uncertain future chooses.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me.
Picciuto, however, has an encouraging message for the mothers of all children suffering from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
You know it's gonna get better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
The heavy rains and floods called for rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and large floods in Louisiana have forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpour, many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and in the southern Mississippi are poured out of their shores and threatened with massive flooding.
Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's office for national security and preparedness for emergency situations, said they were getting requests for vehicles to ride in water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only Tangipaho County asked for 10,000 sacks of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most of the Southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The weather service stated in the declaration that it could rain even more about 8 to 13 centimerts above the sea.
In South Alabama, the flood patrol was on alert on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the Comite rivers are supposed to culminate at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs this weekend.
The meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said can flood a number of houses in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He also stated that the dangers are flooding downstream in the Ascension district, when these submersible flows will only be flowing slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest levels of local time on Friday morning at 9: 00 a.m.
Paramedics are still picking up people from torrential waters in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were already among the survivors of Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which are normally more than 120 meters from his house, quickly rose overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," said Hansford.
I had it all the way to my waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever seen on a river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family members are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers rescued all three giant military-style trucks and transferred them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continued heavy rains, floods "rapidly spread" and authorities are considering evacuations.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston announced that 35 centimeters of rain had fallen between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
The authorities have stated that heavy rain and paid roads have demanded the rescue of the inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the abolition of teaching in five school districts.
The branch of WWL CBS reported that 200 homes were flooded according to the old man from Tangipahoe.
The inhabitants have been evacuated to two churches, which are both now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that were imprisoned by high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to fall," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, and local residents were given sand bags that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last great floods we had here in March," said the administrator of Lacy Landrum.
These floods appear to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in the county of Harrison, Mississippi, said that persistent rain continues on the Gulf coast.
He said a couple of houses were announced on Thursday, but none of them showed up on the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahai Brown (6) - "A boy shot like a man," survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week.
The baby's grandparents identified him as Mahai Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He took so much, his little body was shot to death," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The station's family said the boy should heal.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahai Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two other victims are in stable condition.
According to the station report, a child was found shot in the front seat of a vehicle with a 29-year-old male in critical condition.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are looking into whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
CBS investigators at Philadelphia have reported that there may have been a shootout between several armed men.
Shell casings from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found at the scene.
Apparently, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
Thus, it appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved, "said Captain Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one's been apprehended, and the police are supposed to be looking at surveillance tapes.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a stray gunshot on Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is exactly how I imagine a women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And two, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kociano.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of black women and Latin American women at the top of this sport.
Gymnast number one in the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals was surprisingly the champion of the Olympic Games, and America was cheering.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the female multitudes of individuals.
And a member of the Aly Raisman team got silver.
We're witnessing a sports peak, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics class in the country.
Simon, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They're "the final five," because the gymnastics team for the next Olympic Games will only be composed of four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that keep parents who pay for training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their dependants and families). And that is far from it.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts this is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring in gymnastics practices that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started a gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer gymnastics free of charge or with low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and the hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It's the inspiration this team is going to send thousands of young girls who want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving "girl strength" and winning Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to go on the road to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next strike.
The ministers hoped that after the renegotiated agreement was concluded with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be an end to the disagreement over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37 000 young doctors who took part in the elections rejected the agreement.
In July, Hunt discovered plans to force a contract, saying that NHS was in "no one's country," and another delay would have a detrimental effect on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
In the statement last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee on Young Doctors, stated: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, particularly in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and thus fair treatment of all doctors."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with the reluctance to involve Dr. and often the deafening silence of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push to force and resolve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, because nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that, following the conclusion of a revised agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be disagreement on changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work by the weekend for 54 000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, has called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "There is little or nothing to be achieved by the industry, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and there will be increased concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families."
In the last two months, we have discussed with the board of young doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and an informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as utilization, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was proof of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attacks will be able to take a drug that costs around 60 crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend that more patients take it over a longer period of time.
The anti-blood clotting medication of Ticagulor reduces the risk of seizures again in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be administered to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another seizure or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by a fat build-up that creates a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is removed, a blood clot may occur, a blockage of access to the heart and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the blood stream, block the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of having another seizure.
Ticagulor, which is produced by AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of precipitating less likely.
In the draft NICE directive published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticaggillor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that, with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, it is not recommended in the design of the treatment beyond this time.
With computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas.
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report
The culture of political correctness has led to a disregard for widespread fraud in Muslim communities, which is now mentioned in the government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, election inspectors and city hall for ignoring voter abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former community secretary, now ruler of anti-corruption intervention, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make cords in front of the polling rooms and protect frightened voters.
He recommended that voters take an identity card with them and be able to prove who they are at the election.
At present, voters need to state their name and address.
The report also proposes to apply indelible ink to people's fingers when giving up their voice in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It calls for the press to be given greater access to the documents from the meetings and to decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled, the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post following charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman 'cynically intervened' with the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, "led his campaign in such a way that it was a religious obligation for devout Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and impersonates someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about fraud in the correspondent vote - which is said to have been pressured by older members of the Muslim community to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the photo, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: "There has been evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, particularly in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There have been fears that... state institutions have turned a blind eye to such behavior because of" politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists manipulating correspondence voices in order to prevent "extracting votes."
The report currently evaluated by Theresa May also calls for more thorough registration checks to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to submit an identity document before the vote.
Using indelible ink on people's fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
To ban political agitators and activists from manipulating surrendered correspondence voices and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordon around the polling rooms.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute people exerting illegal coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Disable the taking of photos in the polling rooms.
Require that only the English (except Wales) work in the polling rooms.
Strengthen training to ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go into voting cabins individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it's "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges have been filed.
"The Court of Elections ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of a crime.
It also criticises the unnecessary "check-box checks" in the voter registration departments at City Hall.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's judgment in the Tower Hamlets case was awakened.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of a parliamentary democrat, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threatens this reputation.
Deluded by the cycling doppelganger of Duchess Kate and other doppelganger of famous personalities at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 have gone crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which is remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only athlete seeking gold this year, who can boast of his own doppelganger from among well-known personalities - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Olympics in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
A member of the American archery team Brady Ellison (on the left) has been compared since he was a child to Leonard DiCaprio.
Next to Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer might be a twin to the star Leonard DiCaprio.
The racer from Brady Ellison's American archer team caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures came up that looked remarkably like a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Leo since he was a child.
"He himself sees no great similarity, except perhaps a beard," said Brady for the Huffington Post.
"He's cool and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: a striking resemblance between the British jumper to the distance of Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Aliya Mustafin, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of Gell Matthew Morrison for years.
And for a change, the user thinks that Nathan is the "athletic version" of an actor from the film "Origin"
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov boasts not only the same eaten skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord, and about Nathan Adrian from the US team, the fans say she looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Fellow Women: the star of Hope Sol (left) football and the actress of Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not just one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind a similar look of couples
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the website that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
The football star Hope Sol and the actress of Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among the other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the winner of the gold medal for the gymnastics of Gabby Douglas, proud of his beautifully wide smile, which is like copying Gabrielle Union's smile, the star of the movie Bravo, girls!
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games is sorry for calling a Chinese swimmer "exploded."
A performance analysis by 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald was outraged by Wednesday live television from the Olympic Games at CBC station.
The CBC Canadian station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "pulling like a stink" and "exploding."
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when at the end of the women's baton finale at 4x200 meters free style began to spit his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "revival" to the CBC commentators' team, said, "That little 14-year-old from China has given up, man."
Too much excitement, like a smell, blew up.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race at 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to follow China.
The audience in Canada began to quickly sound online and were appalled by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter, "The announcer on CBC said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China" exploded "???"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air. "
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay race at 4x200 meters free style was described as "The little 14-year-old from China has given up, man."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides, and many were asking for his appeal.
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, 'Wow # Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for the live comment of MacDonald and said, "We're sorry for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped on the air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened. "
CBC finally apologized to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to a comment
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and added their apology to the answer for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments of commentator MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement.
She sincerely regrets that those words were spoken, that she should not have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and those watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of a swimmer, not a swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to explain his comment by claiming that he didn't want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the relay of women," he said on the air from the Olympics at CBC station.
"I meant the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer herself."
"There is no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect, and I am very sorry."
Customers in Primark offended by a woman who blatantly tried on her underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman undressed herself to test her panties in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were not sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to get her size off, took her panties off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and finally tried out four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Flokestone.
Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her panties before she put them back on the shelf.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that the mystery woman, after trying on her underwear, "dressed again and came out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - just standing there, cheeky as a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at her panties undressed again, and apparently she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She seemed totally cool with who was watching - not even thinking about the person who might buy the panties she was trying on."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said, "The idea of someone taking home a pair of panties that someone else was wearing and not having been cleaned.
The event happened Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added, "When she left, I collected things that she obviously tried to get me to take them off the market - which is also the only right thing."
"I'd be terrified of the idea of bringing home new panties and finding out that another woman was wearing them, taking them off, and that they weren't washed."
The spokesperson for Primark's store said, "Primark knows about the incident that took place in our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th."
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sales.
How to defend yourself against weapons attack using Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation, based in New York City to see how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly take advantage of the rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If he approaches you from behind, he says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "have a clear shot path."
Then you grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a loose elbow.
Then he follows his knee into the groin, and while the assailant is writhing in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit the main one in the face, and you begin to retreat, holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body off the line of fire, grab the gun and pull it out so the bad guy can't shoot.
At the same time, put your strength in the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then pull the weapon out of his grip and start to retreat, still pointing it at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Take a look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of an ambush - unless you're the Grand Master of the Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveller decided to test his immune system and gag reflex hard by licking the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and author of the travel papers Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, lured his language with a euro banknote, a handrail on Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on the toilet on the train and a Russian public telephone.
He used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
However, the experiment on the basis of which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train, which has been used by thousands of other people, may seem totally repulsive, but perhaps there are actually far more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright spoke throughout his trip to Europe with doctors and health professionals about strengthening the bacteria of intestinal flora and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left worse in his mouth than aftertaste.
Ian Wright became famous for testing the resilience of his intestines around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public railings on train stations to flushing
In the film he made about it, he said, "I haven't cared much about my health since I was a kid, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to worm eating and muddy water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio made a traveller's movie called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the ugliest thing I've ever felt in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in cooperation with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Valio Gefilus to Mr Wright, which contains lactic acid and vitamin C and D bacteria, which help to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for snacks, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something to watch with interest while at the same time allowing us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They say that interest in bowel health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and we have provided consumers with more detailed information through this document.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, says, "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I asked him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that shows up in the movie."
Licking up some things was naturally easier for Ian, making others hard.
I'm glad we licked some of those dirty things. "
Valio carried out a survey in 2015, according to which 84 percent of the respondents associated lactic acid with the health of the stomach and intestines, and 58% of the respondents reported that at least occasionally they were using products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of socially needed before eviction damaged a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of socially needed people left £50,000 worth of damage on their townhouse after they were charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, the officials of the housing cooperative were shocked to learn that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor cover was torn, garbage lying all over the floor, and the walls were painted.
The family has already moved away and is believed to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, head of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried if the house could be saved.
She said, "It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
A lot of circumstances need to be considered, because this property is likely to come into the picture as a "not-so-nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple had three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and the police said that the terror that the family was causing was street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, fighting and swearing.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the lease agreement, was punished in June for antisocial behaviour.
Several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, were found reeking of garbage.
In the house where the drugs were distributed in the past, there was a torn-out floor cover.
Neighbors say they saw them fighting on the street, and people called the police here regularly.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors, who were relieved, welcomed the eviction that their lives were living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times have we seen the police here, there's no way to count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighborhood supervisor at Cornwall Housing, said the family couldn't work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called by the police
Garbage and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the village house.
He adds: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to take responsibility for her own behaviour and for her family's behaviour. Eviction is always the last step Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors and, at the same time, will carry the message that we will not tolerate dissociative behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenants' sons who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
A polluted mattress that, after eviction, remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
The workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that have been dumped around the house.
In 2014 the police carried out a raid at the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she was trying to sell.
She claimed that the money was based on the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they're going to try to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease contracts.
Angela Crowe of the Denov and Cornwall police said that eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can act impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and dissociative behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low-flight military jet plane over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun's rays in Aveir, Portugal, were scared to death.
The Portuguese Air Force Air Force aircraft P-3C Orion flew all the way incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight, and insisted that there was no danger of security.
The moment the low-flying jet drifted over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists were in panic.
Dramatic footage shows how the military aircraft reaches almost a distance from the sunbathing people on the sandy beach near Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recruits who posted video recordings of a dramatic overpass on social media, said, "The plane flew twice really low, and at one point it seemed to collapse."
Nuno Arroja says, "I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared out of the darkness.
The Portuguese military air force today declared that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight in order to identify a fishing boat off the coast and had to go low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft allegedly flew a little lower than usual because of bad visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that people's safety has not been compromised.
The forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four casualties on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly low due to the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half the providers of funeral services do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (ČOI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
According to it, funeral services do not most often inform the survivors of their prices or issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
ČOI imposed 41 fines in total value of CZK 73,000.
Today her spokesperson Jiří Fröhlich informed about this.
Inspectors found errors at 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmation, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly marked and one seller used an officially unverified measuring instrument.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This concerned urns, candlelight covers and vases which were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"As there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria.
It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Counsel Tasnime Akunjee said that the family had learned of her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian air strike in Rakce, which is the bastion of a group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others, that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that it discourages people from ever making a decision," said Akunjee.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the eastern part of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then on a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria - and widowed within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he'll keep Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Senate leader for the Democratic Party Harry Reid says he believes that the presidential election candidate for the Democrats Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him already in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnel says the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he thought Clinton would pick Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's spokesperson later stated that he didn't directly talk to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chairman of a federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said that republics that block Garland's appointment are "minions" and "minions" of the Republican candidate for Donald Trump's presidency.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are for "women and men."
The magazine Treats cooperates closely with photographer David Bellemer for the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of revealing famous personalities, he's trying to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 NU Muses calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nudity was different from Playboy's old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We must return to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body," said Shaw in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where's vinyl going: who actually buys record records?
Vinyl loves lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to fill in the comment section with the edited comments under the pseudonym of the NeAll Alone Men in the Middle Age, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the so much discussed resurrection of gramophone records is linked not to the boom of lovers who want to enjoy the original possession of a physical object, but to the nostalgia of middle-aged.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people aged between 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It is not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to preserve their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was broadcast as a TV story, the camera would be watching me go to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a subtle gray suit and gesturing widely. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look at it.
While his charm and charm is slowly disappearing from Soho's heart - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, hotels, restaurants and canteens, furniture and office supplies are now filled - several fantastic specialized record shops remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'll stand close to different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional state of mind is.
Stuart (55), native of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one female around 20) has a meeting in London this afternoon and is looking at shops to fill in a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got, like, three or 4,000 records.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture upstairs (he sent me a photo by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
He also has this huge amount of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he couldn't afford when they first came out, and he repurchased what he sold when he was young and he didn't have a penny.
"A lot of what I'm buying is from the late '60s and early' 70s. These are things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small then and I couldn't get them," he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves, and they say, "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many customers he meets fit the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old gramophone records back.
According to my interviews, people were getting rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their gramophone records back, "he says.
This could explain the boom of record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of the gramophone records?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that you will find a pleasant community of people with similar minds in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the system of contactless payments.
Some gramophone panel fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have decided for the familiar environment of the packaging of gramophone boards, things that evoke memories of peaceful maturation.
"I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and so am I, and I think a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" is the co-worker from a bunch of gramophone records.
The ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it yet.
According to the survey, 41% of the surveyed gramophone that they never use, while 7% of the ones that buy gramophone records, they don't have a gramophone.
At this point in the report, he probably seemed really concerned about going through a pile of compilation bossa nova.
Aspects of "trophies" and revival of interest are something that Jonny (42), who works in the Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in the other day and said," I don't have a record yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead board so we can put it on the shelf, "he says.
The percentage of these is not large, but they happen.
It's more about the product side than it is about music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for gramophone boards, has much more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There's a couple of 70-year-olds, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores before - from speakers, instead of pulling jazz, the latest pop from Wild Beasts is full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to guess a severe mental trauma when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) takes a few minutes in Fopp to walk around and view various gramophone boards at a discount.
She's one of those people who looks at the window rather than spend it feverishly.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so there's no way she's collecting gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something. But the gramophone records have their magic..., "she sighs with longing.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that allegedly inspired a new generation of record-player lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I act like I'm very interested in girls' calves in tight jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are currently gathering around Polaroid cameras, and then father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
On the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by the gramophone boards Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone boards.
No one is looking at them - perhaps precisely because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's a purely "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money to the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more likely time and money than there is in other areas, is also the one where it is spent most on the most luxurious goods that vinyl is sure to be.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov appear to be accurate - at least in record-record stores, they do not take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in fact, in record-record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around record stores on Berwick Street, going through records and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV host hiding behind the back of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video portal
According to scientists, the Greenland Shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years old and measuring five meters.
The court in France refused to demolish trade in Jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the order of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair clipping, in temporary restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for several euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that places must be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations in court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-supported associations and other groups do not provide a supplement to food for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Dispute makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Court of First Instance in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 interim shops, but stated that the objections of the prefect Calais were "completely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants have a far greater role than simply serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said that spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was a camp cafe, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization, offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the "children's" cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the cafe would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, the Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants' charities estimated that the number of refugees in the camp increased to more than 9,000 in the summer, most so far.
He thought he was dead.
He's raising himself and his volleyball mouth.
"Since March I have been able to train normally," he reported at the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What was wrong with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then I had heart problems because of it.
Because when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a broken vein in the calf, which will hurt all the time, especially when the weather is changing or working.
But nothing that would limit me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
I didn't know I had an embolism last year at the summer Woodwork tournament, and I couldn't move there at all.
I was throwing up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was done for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Woodwork, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else before.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some problems with my blood, that I have to keep an eye on myself when I go somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Just when I wanted to go back to the Pribrami program last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I knock it, I'm physically better off than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I look forward to it, the gang looks good, most of the guys I know.
I'm curious about the other two strangers who are coming.
I hope we sit down humanly to make it work together.
Will you lift the mouth?
He had a reputation as a bruiser, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now it's two.
There's a new team in Ústí, only a few players left.
It was the last in the extreme, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
Once we use it, it's on us.
We'll see who gets hit after the first rounds, we won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and he's been through a lot, thinking of a better place than the last.
But my coming here wasn't about him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, and I'm a big friend with one, and it was agreed that he would work here.
I'm not saying a name.
In the end, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's a good former player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to tease, and I like to get an opportunity on a not-so-top team.
I've been in Příbram for two years, but the mouth is more challenging than being on the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's already trained in Ústí by Australian Bohm.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And we used to hang out there a couple of times, we used to sit together sometimes after the games, so we met in a friendly way.
We beat them 3-1, and I gave it to him at the start of his summer training in Ústí.
He's got a Slovakian girlfriend, he's a charmer.
The American Nadazdin and Brazilian Z are still coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting with an American, he seems like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm the recording man, the one who makes it, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out who the players were, I looked up online, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the boy jumps, the tall is.
We wrote a couple of messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to being a record leader?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm gonna be 24, and I don't feel like taking turns.
I prefer to be at the center of things, I prefer to keep the team, rather than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I had to be the second record player to do it on full time. If something isn't fully done, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Six months in Pribram, when Kust couldn't make it as captain, he got hurt, then there was money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, where I was raised, I took turns one and two.
He was a great year in Old Town, I had a lot of offers after him and he chose Příbram.
That's where Budejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a fresh start.
Gold number 22.
The short-term position remains Phelps' domain.
"Being back on the podium and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, and he had his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were cheering again in the auditorium, son Boomer this time peacefully slept with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming racially and in a few hours it'll all be over, he said moving.
In the final two seconds behind Phelps, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position, was left behind.
Bronz won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Cup.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline on four games in a row.
For most of the race, he and Phelps were headed by another American Ryan Lochte and domestic Thiago Perreira.
While the gold attorney in the final 50-year-old Kraular put himself to the crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the half-life, he advanced to the final of the race for 100 meters of bow ties.
The legend could not be overshadowed by even the compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the sign double - after a hundred won the Rio double track.
In the final, he left behind 37 hundredths of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, third finished by Rus Yevgeny Rylov.
While last year's World Cup has Murphy's fifth place out of 200, in Rio, he became the signaling king.
He took Larkin off the imaginary throne, and he succeeded in the same double at last year's World Championship.
But in the Olympics, he only won a medal now.
At the Kraular 100, Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel the second one after silver from the relay.
She was the first African-American woman in history to get her swimming gold on the OH.
I believe I can inspire others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I said touched Manuel.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-metre competition in Rio World Record and has silver from Kraular's 200.
Until the sixth end of the world record player Australian Cate Campbell.
Jap Rie Kanet won the two hundred, for whom it is the first Olympic medal in 27 years.
It has no valuable metal even from the World Cup, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia by Julija Jefimov, who, in spite of the doping past, is struggling with the hostility of both spectators and opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
The right to launch in Rio was earned only at a special panel of sports arbitrage CAS just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, they should turn to arbitration court, she added.
- Disappointed, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs have had a special day.
Less than an hour before the game, they found out who they were up against.
They must have mastered tactical training in a flash.
And then, in an unconventional time, the match started on the little court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they reached the competition's lead, but at 19: 19, they didn't make it through the endgame.
In the second, they were clearly better and straightened, but the decisive tie-break failed.
First of all, a number of broken services meant losing 10: 15 and goodbyes with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the game?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I played, we got in the game beautifully.
At the end of my last balloon, I missed the income I was used to before.
We lost the set, which was the key.
In the next set, we got on them with an overview on the field, a different defense, and we pushed on the service.
In the tie-break, there were some very bad lines, and we took it this way.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
Sluková: Shame to start the first set, that's where we missed it.
We were able to download it, but we were missing points.
The second set was great, and in the third, he decided to serve.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about the five, where we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in little yard number one?
Sluková: Similar to China in the backyard.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one hour at night, completely silent, the music didn't play, there was nothing.
That was the difference from downtown.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
How was the preparation for the game when you found out the names of your opponents an hour before the game?
- She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the other players, so we couldn't do tactical training like we did for the other teams.
But Simon (Coach Nausch) prepared a strategy for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
I don't think so.
We played at 10: 30, but not at 12: 00.
Russian Birlov's block in the pre-round playoffs on the OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in the pre-round playoffs on the OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since 10: 00, we had the regime moved forward earlier.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we've prepared ourselves as best as we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not exactly typical, and it probably won't be my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the group's progress was our goal, on the one hand, it's okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now, after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep it off and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, here comes the first snooping SIM.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to acquire SIM from a local operator when staying in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission of Takorn Tantasith has informed that there will be no exceptions.
The sales plan for SIM intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The authorities intend to implement a new measure to monitor their location within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security that will allow the crime committed by foreigners to be dealt with.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIM is intended to help detect persons who exceed the permitted length of stay.
In the case of vendors, there should be a special SIM for foreigners at the side of SIM designated exclusively for Thais within six months.
The difference will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently switched on to cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function in SIM for Thais is not, because they can always be easily monitored," added Tantasith.
It must be added that in Thailand subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires an identity document.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators handed out free starting SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also considered by ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including Malaysia or Singapore, for example.
They also currently have mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country concerned only know relevant network information after crossing the border, that is to say, after applying for SIM to their network.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so low that most tourists will also start looking for local SIM during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to oversee the movement of foreigners have been legally criticised by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, the forthcoming system compares to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, police will need a court order if necessary to monitor a specific person.
Any abuse of the system will be punishable by an undetermined sentence.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently being recycled only after the 90-day deadline after which the SIM did not sign up for the network, a new number could be restored after 15 days in the event of leaving Thailand.
The luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose a new building apartment?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property management will be provided by the caretaker.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in the old houses, the flooring problems, the high energy performance and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is unable to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamila Poláková from the studio Artiga.
Why did you just reach out to them?
Would you recommend working with everyone's expert?
We would recommend working with the architect to everyone if they proposed an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to match the interior accordingly based on the client's wishes.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer already on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was also a clear choice for us in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic demands?
We wanted a generous social-residential space with adequate facilities for a four-man family conceived as a modern but not cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and realize intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, it was necessary to ensure the quality of the execution.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
In the beginning, we set out what we expect from design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including the works of Karel Malich, Karl Vyšilí, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to orient herself in our taste.
Also a combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of an architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art etc. Whether everything is matching together, we then checked together using visualization.
Have there been any complications in the implementation of which you had to give up the original ideas, or, on the contrary, approach the new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building when it was possible for the first time to climb up to the height of our floor, and found that the views that we had planned actually shaded the surrounding buildings.
Back then, we literally changed our disposition overnight from scratch.
A granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the fireplace wall lining.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces supplemented with leather, for example on the upholstery of Norma's dining and bar chairs by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you planning on making any changes, or is there something you wish you had today differently?
I believe it is a modern air interior, which primarily serves its purpose.
There are no changes, most of the modifications after the move took place in the area of shielding and housing terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor where the walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for a household with a dog.
The word architect, Ing. Arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornych, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, therefore it was possible to complete a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the building.
For the interior is an important element of the placement of sun tunnels in the ceiling of the corridor and main toilets.
That's how we got daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you're not negative, says the Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've moved around quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I graduated from journalism in France, which led me to work in a magazine.
Then why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mostly because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are in a negative mood in general, but things have gotten worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
This is how some people judge the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France, because as tourists, they don't see it that much.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big issue.
People feel they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
And now there's a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking down his fingers at me just because I'm Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for a job pretty much anywhere else, and I've come across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know Prague at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like people here are freer.
That I could do anything, dress in any way, and no one would judge me.
In France, someone looks at you all the time, like when you're wearing strange clothes and stuff.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
I don't think the Prague people care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for a travel site for a while.
Then another friend and I started a website on which people are offering and looking for shared housing.
We only work in Prague so far, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends who are Czechs half as well as two friends of Czechs.
I have to say that the other specificity of the Czechs is that at first they keep their distance more.
He won't let anyone near him right away.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses each other on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak English.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even at the convenience store or at the grocery store.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little bit in English, I don't feel the need to learn language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Did you meet with any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Basically, no.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
I can think of one experience.
My manager, Czechka, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense that they are not French, but Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But if anyone had a problem with me being a Muslim, that never happened to me.
Even though a colleague once alerted me to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, to be called names.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you worried that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels might happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I could not imagine such a thing happening in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognise violence at all.
To me, people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says a man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists are covering themselves up with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I feel like I need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří Square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, together with Christians, demonstrated violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But the way I understand it, these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My associates are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, they taught Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate position of women.
How do you feel about that?
There's no way I feel subordinate.
More the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have the strength.
It also has to do with the fact that you're not wearing any headgear.
Hijab, for example?
And it's the way I was raised that's what it's all about.
My mom, for example, is a really principled Muslim.
They pray five times a day, but they just don't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to everyone how they interpret it.
When you read the Koran, you should have your own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran saying that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I thought, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where scarves are required, I will marry him.
Are you planning on staying in Prague?
For now, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
I think Prague is the perfect city for this.
Czech Muslims, together with Christians, demonstrated violence.
The Kozel Fencl Sailing Wind in Rio blew on the advancing rungs.
Friday's sea trips in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were carried out by Czech Sailors Veronica Kozel Fenclo.
In Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure the Czech Republic's participation in the final ride.
You collect the packages like pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea of using already scheduled routes for shipment is the TV director Matìj Liška and manager of Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea they breathed life into three applications with a different geographical range.
We launched the National Transport app in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities recorded in it, and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this before we focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in the interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Transport app work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and details of how big the package can be transferred and how much you want for it.
Someone else might be asking for transport that day.
When the route and delivery time are appropriate, it is paired and they both receive mutual notification.
That's when the chat will open, where the couple will arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find their courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't tell how many registered and how many routes it takes to make the coverage completely optimal and each supply is paired with demand.
It's already working on the main moves, and it's logically easier than traveling between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are building their trust, too, and they're finding out that no one can escape with a package.
You haven't had to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have after two months after the launch?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6 000 people making roads.
We consider that a success, and we believe that more will be packed.
Is there any chance that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be in competition with the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the item on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
With a large company, you'll pay a few grand for delivery in two hours.
You'll pay a hundred or less here, because that's a road someone's already taking.
Should traditional hauliers fear a potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope it will be.
The market has huge potential, huge multinational transporters are fed here, as well as trade chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually discovered that quality was not what they were paying for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox with a note to pick up the shipment at the branch first thing that day after 7: 00 P.M.
I mean, at the time, I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that doesn't piss anyone off and sends a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matej Liška (39).
None of them have ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matej Fox as a TV director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses the already scheduled routes between the world's metropolitan areas, especially by plane.
In 2015, they entered a project for processing a company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and was launched in March 2016.
The Transport app started to develop in December last year and released this year in May.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application has been developed by Monument and Monument Profi since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these applications from the beginning, which one day will come together as one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a theme lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you worried about being in an area that no one can say much about so far where the sharing line is and where the grey economies are?
It's the same, just another product.
We know that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we'll be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to circumvent financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, whether on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax his or her income if he or she makes his or her income.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and earns the carrier or reduces the cost of the journey.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At a time of social networking that divides people, we would like this one to converge.
They can make nice stories, people are happy to help someone and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys, or pills.
People have been missing a personal approach for some time now, and we've been saying that this app is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package won't escape?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the ID card and lists the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give a man credibility to the service.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender reviews.
We offer insurance, we tune in the details.
The courier is liable for the uninsured consignment in the event of loss or damage, but does not take responsibility for content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and does not know it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a sealed package in his trunk, he'll take the criminal responsibility over the sender.
Isn't there a risk of sensitive data being misused from the database?
Registered, if necessary, are traceable by the administration, who will be the only one able to look into it, even we ourselves are not able to see them, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender shall be charged several percent extra for the communication of contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
No one can accuse the courier that he did not deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, taking over and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a block of butter, medium as a plateau of eggs, and big as a case of beer.
After that, there's no more restrictions, and if anyone has a seat in the car, they'll move the fridge.
Plus, the sender has the opportunity to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack if you don't want to hide the contents.
You put a forgotten hoodie in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend of mine had an idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention then.
Then he showed me a demo app with a supranational range that aimed mainly at passengers by plane.
At that moment, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I'd like to become one myself and put my savings into it.
The next year, development took place before we established Shippansee LTD in London because of the greater creditworthiness of the entire product.
But this is not the version that you're focusing on.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to capture the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still a lot to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers, and we are not dealing with the foreign market that much at the moment.
We know it's a long haul, but we're not bragging, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were sort of upgraded.
The transfer was made when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application by Monk is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and the other side of the world.
It works for the sender just as I will, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your phone.
The applications for couriers who want to do it for a living, we call them the Profi Month.
So someone can make extra money picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, student, mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the way to work.
Now that everyone's messing around with the pokémon, they can pick this up just the same.
You see where there are orders around town, you come to it, click, and you see when it has to be delivered, and you move the shipment.
It's set cheaper than competing services.
At this point, we are still doing a web interface that will be crucial for shipping companies, filling in information about them on the web, creating points on the map.
We are then able to invoice their use of the service every month.
Are you now full-time on the project?
It makes us feel worse, but we have it normally when we work, so that we can feed and develop the project.
There is not a strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other came up with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage the Czech market with us, but who should go with us to the global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten diversity.
This will correct the second episode and the solo game will be more varied in it than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours, and the filling should be based on the concept of network backlash in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using a battle titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will include levels aimed precisely at skillful movement.
They're going to be like platform games, and they're going to include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, wall running and rope slide are essential to overcoming them.
In addition, enemies will sometimes have to be eliminated.
There will be no maps that resemble a maze and levels with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to lift and slide down platforms and close massive doors.
You will adjust the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should, as a result, oscillate between the rage of action and the quieter moments to explore an unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper's pawn dreaming of a pilot's career.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimosa, will crash on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And not even the wilderness will be lenient to him.
In addition, Lastimosa will suffer fatal wounds in the crash, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with bringing the Captain's Titan back online.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's calls with the titan will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, the robot's de-personalized communications will create humorous moments.
For example, when the titanium is dry, it will list all the injuries that Cooper is facing in the scheduled jump-off.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign came from the Polygon server.
The result can be assessed in two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions from the network game after Gamesco.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes back to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ publishing company in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the company name.
Nordic issued, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnicious Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 games are created for publishing and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found herself a man 20 years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - she was obviously trying for him for a long time, then they got together.
He's kind of a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she used to date a guy like that in front of me.
She's totally into him.
On those first days, her voice even changed, she had this girl's, like, love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I was watching the whole thing.
He then came from work regularly at 3: 30, and so she always left at 3: 00 to buy.
Every day, she tried to get her eyes on him.
Later, I found out they were meeting in his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got my keys, he was determined I'd catch them there.
But I don't know why, I always stayed home in the end.
I've never been able to go in there, make that decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me.
I think she soon found out that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted.
And I actually did.
Maybe I'm just such a pussy.
At the time, my neighbors suggested that she knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all burst, it would be bad.
The only thing in the family that knew that was going to happen was the daughter.
So I always put it off, go on and on.
But I went to his apartment once to see if I could use some help in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was seeing my wife, and that he was suggesting everything.
I asked him what he'd say.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, looked into the ground and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way from the store at the time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never been out much, who's having trouble meeting someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about the divorce.
I was always counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all of this and move on with my life.
It wasn't like that.
And I've basically never dealt with all of this.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her a lot, but I ended up giving it up for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife is my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's hardworking.
I always thought she was trying so I wouldn't have any other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice, too.
But sometimes I want to pet her, hug her, and she won't let herself.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we're happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
Even when it started and I was carrying it very badly, I once told her I didn't want to live, and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to see if she'd agree to it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her, yes or no.
But she thought, and she finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim people.
After terrorist attacks, France is stepping up the fight against radical Islamists and calling for help both the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who undermine public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual educated men in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop financing mosques from abroad, where preachers often come with money vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim people.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it should have helped to make the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction more transparent.
Soon, she was hit by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
Former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state, will appear at the head of the new foundation.
There are around 2500 mosques and prayers in France, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled around 80 Islamic clerics from the country and are considering this move for several more tens.
German police have also intervened against jihadist clerics this week.
Imam reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them ran the space where the believers supposedly radicalized themselves and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate about a new institution that will replace a dysfunctional foundation erupted in France.
It was all hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee imams.
However, it is not yet clear where he will receive funding, even though several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, namely meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by a halal food vendor for granting a permit.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them leave France on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, only preachers who have undergone educational programmes at the universities in France should operate in the French mosques.
As a result, their sermon should be in line with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have closed twenty since December and others will follow," said the Home Secretary Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no room in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown gunman at a shopping mall in North Spanish Zaragoza on Friday morning, writing an independent journal.
The shooting took place after a woman and daughter left the garage in their car.
A man was waiting in the car outside the mall where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, writes the Independent.
The wife was taken to the hospital by an unharmed daughter, and an ambulance must have arrived for a man in critical condition.
The crime occurred around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes Independent that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Envelopes with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well-digested meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so, from the summer gardens, it smells like grilled neck, brisket, pork belly.
Not very healthy, not very light, yet sometimes with the exception of lettuce or roasted vegetables.
Right, barbecue is time-saving and dishes, plus it's a social matter, and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to doing well with delicacies that make the dining special, their preparation a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke.
And they will also contribute to our health.
Whether it be homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-mastered griffs will be enough to make preparation fun and food itself a real exotic delicacy.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even the time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is falling short.
The paper can only be softened in the water for a moment and then only depends on the cook's imagination as he intends to play with the filling and accessories.
There's no eyelash like eyelash.
The advantage of a range of Asian cuisine dishes is that raw materials are generally already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic flavours accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy spicy and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
All you have to do is buy a bag of adequate size, and an annex with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting both digestion and cough or flu resistance, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used especially in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within various festive occasions and rituals.
Long banana leaves are very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America as a "tool" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed in the same way as in tinfoil.
The banana leaf then also gives the dish a specific flavor.
We can buy them in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even cut in the shape of wheels.
But choose only leaves of deep green and thus healthy - uncracked and spotless.
Similarly, the preparation of salad from wakame, sesame and sesame oil is easy.
You can buy it frozen again.
Anyone who often eats or prepares sushi will probably know the nori fold in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed from which it is produced by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - i.e. plates intended specifically for the manufacture of sushi.
Wakame - dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido - is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the seaweed nori.
By the way, who doesn't know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women have been using it for a long time to recover from childbirth.
And yet, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents gray hair and is literally charged with mineral substances.
The dried and crushed wakame also serves as a spice, for example for the seasoning of rice.
The fresh algae are first let out in the water, then rinse, put in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
They then cool in ice water, cut out the middle ribs, and continue to adjust, for example, as a favorite salad.
But buying it already finished, frozen, is the easiest solution.
All that remains is to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a long-life bomb.
As long as you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little finesse, and you have an interesting fresh meal that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g salad cucumbers, 60 g Wakame algae and 60 g sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chili sauce, 20 g mangoes and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little bit of pine nuts.
First, let's get the rolls ready.
Let's soak rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to get soft.
In the meantime, in the hot water we cook asparagus shoots briefly, after about three minutes we let them cool quickly into the ice water so they don't lose color.
Put vegetable filling on the authorised paper and wrap it up.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, cut them into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put them on rice paper.
Put asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add rolls and finish off the whole dish with wakame, pickled ginger, mango slices, sprinkle with black sesame and add some pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven rugby, Fiji's choice takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in a seven-gauge rugby ended in a devastating lead on the last hurdle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43: 7.
The Fijans have shown a master lesson in processing, landfill, evisceration, supporting game, running on line and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unseen price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - the third one for Britain on a given day - and the British could have been at their performances in the inaugural Olympic Seven Rugby Tournament, proud, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard-earned 7: 5 South Africans in the semi-finals that same day may be frozen in the finals.
But Fiji, in his form, would defeat a 15-member team in full health.
This may not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon, is the head coach of the Fidjan.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost the only one.
This defeat may hurt, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began magnificently, the British penetrations reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a series of buses on the move, and the world cup champions led 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau appeared from around the corner.
The clock showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed the Fidjan down.
In the seventh minute, he threw jasa veremalua touchdown into the right corner, and the brits lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one when he returned, and there was still more than 1 minute left in the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated the sluggish Brits and stormed onto the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29-0, there was a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for the rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to pass.
That's exactly how it is.
The British, after half-time, had made mass changes and stopped the Fiji onslaught... for four whole minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji Josua Tuis passed on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise an an an an 36-7. But the game had already won the Pacific Island residents and their fans in the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the utterly joyful attitude of the Fiji people.
In the final moments, Mata Viliam sweetened the Fidjan victory with another attempt.
There was a whistle, the Fijans hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely adrift.
Before that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, and Britain surpassed South Africa in the close semi-finals - one conversion difference.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the line of defense and scored under the hook in the second half.
Marcus Watson's great late landfill, Anthony's brother from England's 15-year-old team, secured victory - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, to win the rowing race, inspired the fight of the coach with cancer.
You won't find any more emotional gold on these Games, and that's what I'm going to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exhalations into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two oars sitting in the oars, there were three voices in the boat. As the ship hurled along the surface to meet the second Olympic gold in a row in the race of female couples, there was still a voice in the boat of the still-present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying along the water surface with the elegance of swans - does not reflect the nature of victory entirely.
Behind every gold medal from rowing is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which, bit by bit, make a difference, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
In his words, it was uncertain.
I've had bladder cancer that I can operate on, and I've had this surgery.
Anything could have happened without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It kind of changes your perspective.
The cancer was detected to Williams in December 2013.
The happiness for the whole trio was that he could have started treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, to reduce the blackout to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is the way, but this has been a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory were their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own restlessness.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who's been on a mission to Afghanistan, said, "I've been down with emotions this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked and Robin have worked.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he has a huge thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
The couple put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't cope with.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark started approaching, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At the most, we were focused at the moment.
Helen was screaming, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to achieve anything fabulous.
We weren't looking forward to the fireworks tonight, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to think about it before they decide what's next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her future is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was gonna be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about this, "she said.

Prison?
Let them drive people for free, says the Rubeš taxi hunter to the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are, as stated by the Czech Republic, defendants.
You have made a series of reports in which you have discovered fraudulent practices and those to be in a group that will stand trial.
You faced a few unpleasant fights with exposed players because of it.
How much is the report on the indictment of members of an organized group turning out to be?
I thought there might be a trial.
I'm just curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
They should give back all the stolen money in the first place.
And they should return them by driving all the people around for free.
That's a rather quirky solution.
So does this mean that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one of them is doing a ping, one of them is delivering pizza, and one of them totally blew it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with the withdrawal of liberty.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
People like that should return the companies that took it.
For a quarter of a century, they have committed the destruction of our country's name and the foul-mouthing of people.
Now let them make a good business card and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to pick up garbage, they get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get probation eventually, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondřeček Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlín.
It belongs to people who started viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Stream.cz Internet TV, where he is involved in a series of programmes, he is now preparing the show Prague Guide, which is mainly intended for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, the Rubeš advises them which services he would rather avoid in Prague and which he recommends to use without fear.
Previously filmed series with names How to, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the prosecution, they're referred to as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent cabbies be described as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the ones we know from the Godfather.
It's more like mafia juniors, but they're organized for sure.
Just that they're watching each other's cabs.
Prague is all broken up.
I found out that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at the Karlovy Vary Spa (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on their little place, and each group is organized somehow.
It's probably a complex network.
But the defendants are only seven people, six cabbies, and one former magistrate who warned the driver about the checks.
As you say, the unwelcome phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of the Prague imposters in the taxi service do you estimate is this?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst people on the street still are.
I'm talking about, for example, Aleš Ryjáček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the Charles Bridge and drives people.
Last time I rode with him, he asked me for seven hundred for three kilometers.
His police didn't arrest him for any reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The same situation is also the case in other locations in Prague.
Thus, the prosecution of seven people will find it difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague scourge, which seems to be much larger in size.
Of course, it's no use.
It helps, but all evil doesn't go away, that's true.
Do cabbies who steal from foreign tourists still perform in the same places you showed in the reports, by the Charles Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and break the regulations every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if they are part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I thought of it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is, and always will be, for the centre of Prague to improve.
And even if I feel like it needs a little bit better, I will continue to do so.
We need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays, we should still be doing something to remove him.
You can't settle for that.
But it's not like that, there's more of them, of course.
Are you still trying to confront them in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although he then claimed that it was CZK 56 (he used the decimal point trick).
He had a receipt, the cops came, and this cab driver was so cute, he still went to the cops and asked them when someone would finally give him the $56.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taximeter overglued the decimal point and robbed the tourists by 357 crowns.
Is it fair to say that the insolence of fraudulent taxi drivers did not give way even after you showed the faces of those who charged meaningless sums for a short ride in your footage?
Their insolence is still incredible.
What happened to the cab driver who demanded 56 crowns?
The police sent him away saying that they couldn't discuss it on the spot because he put out a receipt.
And that, I think, is going to be a problem in that court, too (six cabbies and one ex-clerk).
There's gonna be a cab driver on one side with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
But according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the Magistrate must not use the secret footage of a taxi service vehicle as evidence in a court of law.
When I was shooting parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I'm the shot, but I've always wanted to use it for a story.
Are you concerned that this fact might protect them from trial?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a kilometer, because he wouldn't eat it.
You were talking about a trick with a decimal point, which, especially in front of foreign clients, underwater taxi drivers move.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about using this ploy after the release of your stories?
I think we've put this trick on the air to the show, on the contrary, popularize it.
I drove a cab driver the other day, bragging in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
Then I noticed that a black cardboard was glued to the side of the meter.
When I asked him what he had in there, he said, "You know what it is."
If the fines didn't work too well on taxi drivers, can they be warmly impressed by the courts with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You said you thought they'd find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can discourage them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair cab drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
In my experience, I have to say that, fortunately, those fair taxi drivers in Prague prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have the taste, but they miss the um.
He's not very good at it, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they held the demonstration (because of the proposal for a full-scale restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it did not seem very clear what they wanted.
They once said they didn't object to the Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than the Uber.
The way it turned out, they just blocked Prague and only made it the best possible ad for Uber.
How do you evaluate the approach of the Prague City Council in solving the problem of overcharging the fare?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The Magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole who was giving out information, which means the taxi department has been doing their job for years for nothing.
I hope they charge that clerk for every last check he's ever had to check to see what he's done.
'Cause that's what I think the worst part is.
I even went on a control drive with him, which I didn't find out until after their schedule.
It's been months since the last episode of the series was published.
What's the response?
I mean, especially with foreign viewers, to which the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have my friends from abroad, I let them watch the videos.
And then when we go down the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people that we see in the footage are actually standing there.
The infamous celebrity of Prague.
But seriously.
I'd put a fence around them so people would look at them.
A museum of communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need it?
Right.
I travel with services that I don't have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are many dispatches that are fair.
I only took a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Wow, you've got some nerve."
Be disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were already written in 2005.
In the same year, former mayor Pavel Bém went on a control drive dressed as an Italian tourist and was cheated by the driver by two hundred at the first attempt.
But the editor of the Rubeš had worse experiences.
The taxi drivers charged him for driving from Old Town to Wenceslas Square CZK 820, which is based on approximately CZK 195 per kilometre, as calculated by the story makers.
The Prague City Council set a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the reported reports: for example, a two-kilometre trip from the street of Paris to Truhlářský cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For driving to the Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers, they charge even six hundred crowns.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer the better.
Impurities come out of it well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it has to be removed from the fold.
It's not easy, and it's not going fast, and the restoration woman, Vanessa Trostova, from Oldřichov in Hájí, brought her work closer.
Hats down in front of her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, which needs to be climbed and climbed countless times.
"The restaurant should be meticulous, patient and undemanding on the working environment," she noted.
In Frýdlantsk, this is far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to it, the stone elements of the facade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant Town Hall were restored, as well as the statues of St. Mary Magdalena in Zatiše, St. John Nepomucký in Frýdlanta, Pietu in Frýdlant Circular Street, Mariánské Column in Frýdlant or Atlanta in the facade of the spa in New Town under Smrk.
The reconstruction of the tombstone of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern started in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of stone elements is cleaned from the load of dirt and crust, loose stone parts are secured against fall and shift; either they will anchor to the wall or to each other.
They will also be treated and preserved on the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will turn gold again.
"It will then begin with the gilding of the inscriptions on marble plates with pure plain plain gold," said Referee of the State Memorial Care Office in Frýdlant Vera Sobotová.
There's no record of a gravestone going through any repairs from the past.
When they look closer, they'll grab holes drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old, and these are the remains of the tombstone.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish raid during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
They literally combed the tombstone, marked by Sobot.
In the Church of the Found Holy Cross, the restoration people with a slight exaggeration are at home.
After the flood in 2010, the tombstones that were found underwater needed to be put in order, the baptists were restored, the wall paintings in the tomb, and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to get into the stained glass in the future," said Sobot.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, each year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
The restoration work on the reconstruction of the Redernovsky tombstone will cost a total of 128,000 crowns.
They will be paid by subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the recovery.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the regional round of the historical city of 2015 competition, the remaining 28,000 crowns is then a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, specified by the mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the prize to restore the tombstone.
Experts' views on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored by indexes and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in markets.
Who would have thought it before the beginning of the year.
The US S & P500 index, which was going through 12% of the corrections in February, is now at a new historical maximum and has already credited 7% since the beginning of the year.
The iron rule is thus reaffirmed once again that traders should never go against the interest of central banks in the long run, which in the end have always achieved their goal.
In a situation where US shares are at their historic peak, volatility is disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown with satisfaction and without fear due to the quantitative easing of the US central bank, and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable below 12 percent.
And neither should I.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will be buying bonds worth £70 billion in the next six months, has also taken a step forward.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low returns even further and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without much fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market, and the situation in China is stabilizing, and the brexit is basically no longer a topic, so perhaps we should not be too surprised if US stock continues in a similar calm regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
I wanted for this difficult work of an experienced politician, said European Commission Chief Juncker, when a French politician (indeed experienced, because, with so many different supranational political functions, that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) appointed the main negotiator of the European Commission for the conditions of Britain's departure from the EU.
Juncker's choice has blown out a hint of hope that it is in the EU's serious interest to look for forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most British media accepted the name Barnier as the Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He took it in the way that only he could take it: the stubborn enemy of Anglo-Saxon free market concepts and the model of capitalism.
The advocates of multilateral regulations were co-authors of the concept of the so-called banking union, and, with a grudge against everything that comes from the London City Financial Center, he pushed the legislation through the excessive regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and apparently ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, not to mention the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is why the Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies today.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this -.
It would be good for everyone!
An earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin Master has released his close Ivanov.
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidency.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
She informed the Russian media about this with a reference to the Kremlin press release.
In doing so, Putin indicated that he was releasing Ivanov at his own request.
At a meeting that was broadcast by Rossija 24, the president said he was in favour of Ivan's wishes when he took office, that he wanted to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the President's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current representative, Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is referred to as one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer, for example, served as Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He will now leave the seat of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, when he met Putin, said that he was actually a record man for the length of his stay at the head of the administration.
He lasted four years and eight months in it.
In this context, he pointed out that 11 people had already been replaced in this capacity 25 years after its establishment.
Neither Kvita nor Dumbass Uncle and Shafer will play the finals.
So far, none of Friday's tennis games have been turned into a final turnout.
Petra Kvitová, who succumbed to Monica Puiga's Puerto Rican surprise after 4: 4, 6: 1 and 3: 6.
After a while, Czech debblers Shaphává and Uncle followed.
In the first set, the Williams Slayer reached for the win, but they wasted two setbols, and the Russians eventually caught the short game set.
The second set then lost 4-6.
Half of the success rate in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skipper Ondřej Synek won his semi-finals with an overview when the second Damir Martin from Croatia was defeated by almost a second despite the slowdown at the end.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I was trying to save as much as I could, said Son.
It was his opponents who had to fight for progress, unlike him.
So it took some of their powers away, so that might make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the oar of the Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinko-Knapk didn't follow in Snyk's footsteps.
Thirty-five-year-old rowing girl took fourth place in today's semi-finals, and on Saturday she will start in the B finals and fight for 7th to 12th place.
They can't defend London gold like that.
For the first time in the Olympics, I didn't make it to the finals.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I was driving a good race and I put everything I could into it.
The contestants were just better, and Topinko Knapko bowed down in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed she'd make it to the top six at her fourth game.
She gave up the fight just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could move out of that field.
I was surprised the Chinese girl had such a finish line.
And I thought I could make it to the finals through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, there was a life race today, said the 2011 world champion.
Far beyond the final gates in Rio, young shooter Filip Nejchal remained, who for the second time failed to get out of the qualification, this time the lepers in the lie.
In it Nejchal took 33rd place.
Qualification was best served by the Russians.
From the first rung went Sergei Kamenski with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nejchal's shot was worth 620,5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the program in Rio for the first time, including Czech seven-boyars Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachy belongs eleventh place after the second event of the Olympic competition, Czech record player Eliška Klučinová is 22nd.
She is led by British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both of them took care of the most historically best extravagant performance in a seven-fight.
They tried to jump an inch, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of asking questions like this: German society has gone through deep self-reflection, while the Russian one has not.
In both major Eurasian nations, dictators appeared in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism, which is mentioned in the Black Paper of Communism, whether it is daily individual repression, targeted famine, incompetent war leadership or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis wiped out about 6 million Jews in an inhumane way, and the total victim of World War II is estimated to be 60 million.
German and Soviet atrocities were carried out in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively or simply by cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came to the Denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the kids grew up, they started asking, "Daddy, Grandpa, why were you involved in such atrocities?"
How could you do that!
This brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites cared mainly about the country's prosperity, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of its citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to reconnect Alsace-Lorraine or someone - for a revanche - to attack militarily - that is something that anyone will recognize.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Russia's politics is a revanche, the conquest of lost lands, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of your own people is no value to the faithful.
Beat them, and the strangers will fear.
I still believe that it is only the decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the increase in tension around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
The situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated in recent days and hours.
Who benefits from the increase in tension?
After a long time of relative peace, relations between Ukraine and Russia again deteriorated.
The pretext of the Ukrainian Party became the peninsula of Crimea, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both opposing sides are difficult to verify independently, and so we can only think about the old question of who does it benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea by the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of Ukrainian special forces in Russia has already been reported from the case of pilot Savchenko that they were allegedly abducted in Russia.
If we accept the Ukrainian version, what good would it do Russia to make the situation around Crimea worse?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, especially by the West, in the form of further assertion of sanctions and intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the backdrop of the immigration crisis into Europe has led to a decline in attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost complete credit in front of its citizens when President Poroshenko's current support is around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been bankrupt long ago without generous financial injections from the EU and, above all, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention once again to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation with voters in its country.
Once again, President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the force forces want to prove themselves to be strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who are attempting to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realise their huge responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but of all the ordinary people on both opposing sides, and will stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria showed inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, monthly inflation was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2% was published.
The annual average rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12-month period (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0,8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0%, so monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0,2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0,2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the journeys of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2,2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0,5%), health (0,1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
They say the U.S. Secret Service has been tracking hacker attacks by the Russians for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the Party's Democratic Headquarters's servers.
But there is no official report on Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would reveal that the US secret services are monitoring the hacker attack, and that the way they are doing it and what resources they're using could be revealed.
They say two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Council
The tracking material on the Russian trail was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, written by Reuters.
Only a small group of eight leading congressional members, called the eight gang in the US, were informed of public officials.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the chairmen of the Democrats in both chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of Congress' defence and security committees.
On Thursday, the President of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazile, announced that she was forming a cyber security advisory body to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's initiative on health problems after consumption of the Salmon Wild Smoked - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague Hygiene carried out a check at Albert shops on Wenceslas Square and on the Bridge.
The verification found that a batch of L23012562 / T4 with a consumption date of 22.11.2016, to which the customer pointed out, was no longer available and therefore a product of the same batch with a consumption date of 11.12.2016 was withdrawn.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm digestive tract of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for man - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and human ingested live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Šticha.
We apologize to our customers very much for the problems with this brand product.
We immediately withdrawn that lot from the sale and, for preventive reasons, we also withdrew all other lots of this item.
The error occurred on the side of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had the product tested ourselves, the spokesperson for Alberto Barbora Vanko told the Newsletters.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was a company called Necton - Pines.
They informed the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration of the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to the server safetinodoby.cz people after eating the parasite can become ill with anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, reported by ČTK.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the larvae, they usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Both adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures and are therefore killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians have currently checked salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
A shipment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expedited, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packages.
Currently, the unsold product stocks are being downloaded from stores, said ČTK spokesperson of SVS Petr Pejchal on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman tried to escape from Rakka, probably killed by a Russian raid.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadis who was soon killed, sobriety came.
The expected paradise of the caliphate has turned for British girls into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She called her repeatedly in Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without thinking, quoting The Telegraph lawyer of the deceased girl's family Tasnim Akunjee.
The last traces led to Rakka, where the girl called last.
Then there was only a report of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they were hoping to meet their former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house in which she was staying was leveled with the ground raid in May, reported by British ITV News.
TV added that the bomb was probably dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS bastion in Syria.
You'd be able to take the blue out of the sky just to get your kid out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) thought of escaping from the territory of the Islamic State, one Austrian was caught trying to escape and, according to the information available, was publicly beaten to death.
I think she saw it as a warning and decided not to take any chances, according to the BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum and Amira Abas went on the road on February 17 last year.
The only thing they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they headed for Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadiza back.
You'd be able to take the blue out of the sky just to get your kid out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking being caught by a lawyer.
The only positive thing he thinks is that the fate of the Kadiza can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, realized how things were there, understood how far it was different from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and wanted to return," said Akunjee.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is unknown.
But as they have also gone silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
Jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the municipality of Investaray was the regional centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held at City Hall and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were pitiful, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them are successful.
That's why city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it has not been in operation for a long time, and it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, as smaller remedies were expensive for operation and did not pay too much.
The stories of the prisoners and the ghost hunt.
For the public, the prison opened up centuries later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions existed in them.
The guides in period costumes add to the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be confined to one of the cells, mostly for a memorial photo, or for a sense of what prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, the prison of Investaray is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it is supposedly haunted.
There have already been several groups of paranormal hunters, and to this day, the museum allows people to come hunting for ghosts.
But such a night will cost £300, which is roughly CZK 9,500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction attracts also great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animus, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality every day and to play with the identity of ways that borders on absurdity.
You can make yourself look like a pineapple, a dog, or a character that seems to have stepped out of Roy Lichtenstein's image.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake will be released immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism of the allegation that the app promotes blackface or that it promotes white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users this week a filter that gave them oblivious eyes, crooked teeth, and bloated faces, some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon - "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated issues of controversy point to a larger problem for society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and news and outrage spread rapidly, and Snapchat stated the next day that he had cancelled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of accounts to animes, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes in action.
The others were unequivocally denied comparison with the animus.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, stated in an e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that "it's hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face, but that the yellow face is driven into a disdain extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has exceeded these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from sitting halls in corporations to Hollywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
"When one snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some users," said 25 Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday, "it's very hard for these things to go unnoticed today, as they used to be."
Katie Zhu, the product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her snapchat account on Thursday and invited the others to do the same.
In the Media article and in the telephone interview, she stated that she believed that racially motivated problems reflected a lack of diversity in recruiting workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the vast white, completely male leadership of the company and ended the article with a hash tag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that they have no diversity among employees and colored people at the moment they decide on these things," said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American origin, "or that the colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak."
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not disclose figures relating to the diversity of its employees, with the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to the spokesperson, the company recently recruited a recruiter who should focus on the underrepresented population and internal management of the inclusion.
Zhuová adds: "I wonder if they really need other users who can say it's not okay," with their account being cancelled.
Army officers have distorted intelligence on IS, says the parliamentary committee.
In a report issued on Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee stated that officers from the central headquarters of the United States changed intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events of the country.
According to the preliminary report by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Defence, "extensive dissatisfaction" was found among central intelligence analysts, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of America's efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report states: "The outputs of intelligence intelligence services approved by superior Centcom officers usually offered a more positive picture of US anti-terrorism efforts than were confirmed by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when superior policymakers are presented with a flawed analysis," said Ken Calvert, congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of the Centcom leadership goes all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts in training the Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no decisive evidence that the Obama administration's leaders ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from the leaders of Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the central staff, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were," stated in the report.
For example, Centcom's representative publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," said MEP Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior US intelligence staff manipulated the output of the intelligence services of the staff in order to downplay the dangers of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after learning about analysts' concerns that intelligence information concerning the Islamic State is being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by further examination.
Further investigations are under way at the Centcom Intelligence Service, led by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very close process for compiling an assessment of information on IS and Iranian security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Committee and the representative of the Democrats.
In Adam Schiff's words, this process "led to the distortion of intelligence output," damaged morale among analysts, and "failed to take dissenting views into account."
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they did not find any evidence that the White House was trying to push Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to a "draft or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published at the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times informed of an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector-General, which was initiated following complaints from the Centcom analysts.
Commander-Lieutenant Patrick Evans, the Pentagon spokesman, said that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the Inspector General is still ongoing.
However, he stated that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombardment in Iraq and Syria is a success (the statement that now states an increasing number of defense officials).
However, last year's allegations raised questions as to how much President Obama can count on the central staff to sincerely evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis areas.
The news criticism of the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team had come to the conclusion that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against the IRS refineries did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not transmitted outside the Central Staff.
Commander of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism the last year after many legislators found the Senate's testimony to be too positive in assessing the war.
General Austin resigned in April and replaced at Centcom by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US won field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be the final game in the UK team.
Katie Bam scored three goals in a game against Japan, which ended with a 6-to-1 win, and only a day later, for the American women's field hockey team, she scored the first two goals of the game, in which on Thursday America beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games is a success worth remembering, but Bamová (27) said she was not sure if she had ever succeeded in such a thing.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those guys who writes their goals down.
But this is what he knows: Americans lead 4-0 games at the Olympic tournament and share the first place in the United Kingdom group, which remained undefeated on Thursday after Japan's 2-0 defeat.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide which of the six teams will end up in first place and who will come in second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group a little longer.
No matter how the game ends on Saturday, the Americans, with their surprise ride, have caused a stir here, four years after they ended up among the 12 teams at the London Games.
That's the team that Bama was on.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and she took a field hockey stick for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older sister twins played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final lineup.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were doing very well.
The next year, an Englishman named Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things started to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the rate of work we have today.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bamová began in the first half by scoring the goal by becendem from the vicinity.
India joined the match without winning the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly tough and kept the score 1: 0 until the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left-hand side of the playing field, then swerved into the center and shot the ball in the goal to get the American girls in the lead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The American goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three victories, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," said Parnham, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of Olympic rampage
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make it felt a persistent, indescribable and biased change of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay pin passed down from the archer to the swimmer, gymnast, and triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the coming darling of women with dimples in their faces, is in the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names will be heard in households in the prime time between advertising and sponsor spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
Olympic fire doesn't shine on all the challenges the same way.
Away from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: shooting from air pistols, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always succeed in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my special favorite, allow me to draw attention to the subtle charm of the trampoline.
Although jumps are an Olympic sport on the trampoline since 2000, when they were first introduced to Sydney games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I questioned did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US has never won a medal in trampoline jumps, and until 2012 none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
Rates in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and the female category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be held by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the trampoline jumps have more bad luck, partly because the ear of the unconsecrated will seem to be more suitable for a clown university than the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential - comic vibrations of infinite reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from Spanish "el trampoline," which means "jumper board."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and showcase the lineup with several elements (rags, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to design, difficulty and "time in the air."
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic course is forward.
Warriors of gold medals must move on, faster and even higher, sometimes until the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They try to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but also with another line, as the television news states: a world record or an Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a little exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline in this respect is a relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she is reflected as if they were in a state of weightless as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is impossible, but for the duration of the assembly there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no distance measurement, but only the perfect, gentle elasticity of time and gravity.
This is as close as the Olympics and Zen get closer.
Qualification and final of women will take place on Friday afternoon, 13 o'clock Eastern time, male competition then on Saturday at the same time
NBC Station will broadcast the final within the afternoon block, which starts at 2 p.m. for both days.
In the midst of Olympic madness, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment that you'll probably miss through the other fights.
And if attention is only to be obtained by male athletes being the subject of lovesick looks and materialization - as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by US gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to gasp.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say a lot of protesters were shot during the clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But over recent months, anti-government unrest has seized the country, spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone on the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed a bunch of unarmed protesters.
On circulating video recordings of protests that are likely to come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are captured beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the dangers of terrorist attacks in the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved - even a new suburban train is running in Addis Ababa's capital.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - organisations fighting for human rights constantly talking about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents silenced effectively.
Many have been banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Tesame, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the young people.
He's been protesting for generations.
There are many complaints and concern everything from land disputes to absolute control of power by the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100% in Parliament.
At the same time, pressure is increasing at the Eritrea border, and the conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
The elitists fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Oroma Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have now ignited again.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when cheaper smart phones have become commonly available and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government forbids access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly the case, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered in protest.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between the Oroms and the Amhars, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhar are not natural allies.
For many years, Amhara, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and used the Oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to a united leadership," said Mulata Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests took place in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhari and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigraj ethnic, which accounts for around 6% of the population and controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the riot is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to a new disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly good at revealing the initial signals of dissatisfaction and using the envoys to process the opponents and get on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, the analyst of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled from relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigrai region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005, thousands of people protested against what the analysts described as the elections that the government screwed up and then stole.
It was followed by a tough hit, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated the leaders of Ethiopia for visionary planning infrastructure such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the city of Gondar in Amhar attacked business companies owned by Tigers, and resentment against Tigers on social networks became increasingly common.
Analysts say that protests put the US and other Western allies in an uncomfortable situation.
The US government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time, it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile area.
"That," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and funding IS as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to downplay the latest controversy that flooded his campaign on Friday, saying he didn't mean it when several times this week he insisted that preziden Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of a Republican presidential candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an uncomfortable situation, who were strenuously defending him in a turbulent time, and he must explain that he may not have meant his remarks.
After this proposal at the meeting on Wednesday night Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the talks that he did not really intend to say that President and H. Clinton IS had been created.
But in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of an old one day's claim, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his allegations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remark to ease by reminding him that Obama was trying to destroy IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump tries to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election polls fall.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in the Michigan duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
On Twitter, he warned again that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and he said that according to him, her speech was boring.
Trump used his defense sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he picked up a wave of criticism, he spoke with the suggestion that the Russians should break into Clinton's e-mails, explaining his remark later, saying, "I am, of course, sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to mitigate them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing, to what extent some messages have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction then he" gave an explanation, "said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think he's skillful in his statements, and he knows that they're vague enough to explain them differently.
As the results of the election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more whimsical tone in recent days, instead of moderating things for the general electorate.
The new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that the Tump is with great distance behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind it in Florida.
Trump tries at all to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he says, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But, along with Trump facing increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes put his devoted supporters in an uncomfortable situation, who must stand by him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he is saying is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani, when asked about Trump's credibility, saying that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That is true, in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he wrongly called a rookie, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton acted as Secretary of State, allowed IS to bubble and failed to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday's gatherings in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter to rain fire on the media for moving every word of it and being interested in it.
He laughed at the "pathetic, pathetic" TV scholars who tried to understand him, and said, "They can't do that!"
A few Democrats grin at Trump's apology, saying it was just further proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
The cafe has been pushed out of the market prices. Now it returns in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in summer 2014 - sells cupcakes-shaped soap.
The locals cried it out as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple posted on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is looted, and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Also the coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
In Verb he began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay for the transfer to a new place, he said he'd be happy to do it.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things the way they were.
Verb still has the same bread supplier and bought the same model espresso machine.
He even used the old Verb lighting again.
Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
There are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find a bowl of brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady flow of original regulars.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices," he said.
There was one of those customers last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb Cafe.
It even happened after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed down, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I love is coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she had a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been going to Verb since 2003.
He comes in before work and orders the same thing.
"At quarter and eight, I come here every day, like clockwork, and they're already preparing my bagel with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal keeps ordering what he usually does, but sometimes he gets bacon, eggs and ham on his bagel.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish people of Greenpoint also received the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it soon so that his new neighbors would feel at home here.
There are other advantages to the new place.
The local fruit juice producer wants to get bottled and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the cafe to expand to the neighbouring building.
Many customers are happy to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop opened up again, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depression food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the presidency in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
The gourmet President Roosevelt enjoyed the selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as the goose-liver pâté and the Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: the devilish-style egg in tomato sauce, potato puree and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who were suffering," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are engaged in gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coe "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, "A Square Meal," published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed themselves cooking solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small dry buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball which, according to a couple, was perfectly suited to a conversation about food during the crisis.
"Meatballs were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
It sold peanut, liver, and bean meatballs.
They were made from the ingredient and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe smiled.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet of what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner served freshly baked pie.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "Square Meal" follows the ways in which the nation dealt with the fact that suddenly it was not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," said Coe on account of why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods, such as meatballs and casserole dishes, casters like "an amazing way to use the leftovers," noted Ziegelman, because the chefs could hide the unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - the central point of American food for many years - has become an energy-saving luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were intended to serve as calorie and nutritional filling, had priority over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During surveys for a book that contains recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period meal of roasted onions filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman pointed out, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't mix.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office for Home Economy between 1923 and 1943 - managed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraged women to take over the budget reins, and snails such as cream spaghetti and carrots, turn into tasty dishes.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, dessert was created in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I'll have a pie."
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farming cuisine of his childhood, he was dining as the selected millionaire he had become.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost gold-plated room, wearing a tux.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him set an example of his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the White House "not only serving almost the most gloomy food in all of Washington, but also in the most dismal way prepared."
A number of food habits from the crisis period went away as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The link remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that during writing the book they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "People were sick of her."
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," said Ziegelman, and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged a spoon into thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as the right landlord, he said to his wife, "I could use a little meatloaf."

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of legal representation in the case of a patent against hepatitis C against the Merck Group
The judge of the District Court has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal fees incurred by Gilead Sciences Inc in the process of a patent against hepatitis C against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment that Gilead should have paid 200 million for the damage caused by the infringement of the two patents of Merck in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni was annulled, after the federal judge found repeated unlawful conduct on the part of Merck, among other things a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman put on the file on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to remission of charges that have arisen in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead medicines.
Americans supported military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
The US-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, said the group spokesmen on Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after leaving the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The troops liberated over 2,000 civilians that the radicals held, told Reuters Sharfan Darwish from the SDF alliance and the Manbija Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we're still searching it," said Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the presidential Democratic candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton was given $1 million for charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation. Expresident Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million to the joint cash register for lectures, and the former Secretary of State admitted $3 million of income from Simon & Schuster for his paper on his work at the State Department.
Clinton's co-nominee, US Senator Tim Kaine of the State of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has published tax returns in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine remain a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreating from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for candidates to publish their tax returns for the President of the United States, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the US Treasury Tax Department's audit as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax returns.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign adjutant on Twitter and followed up on the tax returns of a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN on Thursday that he wouldn't allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, among whom is the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is very strong on the issue and has released a video on Friday, reminding us how high-ranking republics are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, mention the question in your speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"She refuses to do what all the other candidates for the presidency have been doing for decades - publishing her tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico stated that Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim this may also be the case at present.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett to ensure that everyone who makes more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, the Buffet at the Clinton Assembly in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Buffet Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also passed the IRS audit and that Trump is "not afraid" of the financial office, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign released tax returns retrospectively until 2007.
On average, between 2007 and 2014, Clinton, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax of 32% on average and a combined tax of approximately 40,5%.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, wages are only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income in dividends and interest of $109 000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to people's homes - throwing condoms filled with chili powder on them.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, has promoted and trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to protect their homes and crops through this non-violent procedure in four steps without harming animals.
Many of them used to use spears to defend themselves.
Friday is a world day of elephants dedicated to protecting these animals.
"Since they have been developed by this... set of tools, we have noticed a change of behaviour in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them," said the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in the statement.
The first and second steps are on the passing elephant to shine the flashlight and run the horn.
If it doesn't discourage him, the so-called "chilli cloud" will be thrown out.
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom with firecracker, the end of which is wrapped so that only the wick can look out of it.
After detonation, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder spreads into the air.
Usually one breath is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which will trigger a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned to the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calls to Israel at the Arabs' request - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a commotion in the media after finding out that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calls to Israel, in the words of the employee based on the "request" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of a documentary on the Holocaust "Shoah," ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel phone code list.
However, the state was not mentioned among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it that in 2016, Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility of calling Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and with a problem he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, according to his words, "shocked."
The hotel worker replied that the measure was "decided at the discretion of the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this step was even more irritating to the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that Israel's dialing code be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the staff in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case "a great shame."
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
In itself, it is a great shame.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain, is an even greater shame.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, "he said.
The event triggered a strong reaction online, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the hotel Kempinski has simply "lost" in the requirements of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," stated in another post, which points out that the hotel, located in the noble street of Kurfurstendamm, stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dropped any charges by calling the event a "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
"No direct order has ever been issued" not to include Israel in the call code list, quoting Suddeutsche Zeitung a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students.
The conflict between students and police took place in San Paul, Brazil, on Thursday, when the students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to break the students apart, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the governor of the state of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin in order to save money is also the closure of nearly 100 public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see them spray-paint inscriptions on the wall against temporary President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the protesters went mass on the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff when the Senate in the country decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan's trade turnover increased by 70.9% year on year following the abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are restoring existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period for 2015, reaching $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent, reaching $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
A jump increase in trade was ensured by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35 000 visas to Iran's citizens, mostly travelling.
Moreover, for the first time, Iran has reached the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be surpassed, "he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where they are in good condition preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization," he said.
Cattle Callum Skinner hurries home after the British have won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the male team sprint at the Grand Drom in Rio when the VB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man pleased the legend when he rushed to the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of the favored New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won, surprisingly, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth at the World Ski Cycling Championship in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for a specialized initial driver named Jamie Staff.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
After Hoye left, there was also a vacancy he tried to fill in Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British trainers, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy's champion four years ago - and he and Skinner reached the Olympic qualifying record, but took over the leotard in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind the wheel, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation where Hindes went on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped up on the stage, he didn't take his eyes off them.
23-year-old Skinner, native of Glasgow, said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final, and we beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this thing.
After the victory next to Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he fell onto the track on purpose after a weak start.
He pulled the note back later, and Britain's opponents had no chance to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said, "With all those British flags on the bleachers, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we have five days of success waiting for us at the velodrama.
With the form that Kenny showed, it's not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
This would then be for Kenny - who is exactly on a day 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems sacred to British sport, this day also celebrates birthdays Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - means a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
Same as how much Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will be taking part in a sprint that starts today and will last another three days.
A 27-year-old native from Bolton said, "Now I'm enjoying this one.
Team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
That was the only medal race that day, but Britain was expecting more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull have qualified as the fastest in a four-mile combat race.
They're done with 3: 51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3: 51.659.
The first round and finals (22: 42) take place on today's second day of the race, which will certainly be targeted by Wiggins.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the referees called for him to measure his height.
In a similar race of women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia have reached the world record with a time of 4: 13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cycling team and dominated the middle season of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional performance, showing complete superiority in Beijing and London, it has decreased in preparation for Rio expectations.
There were dramatic events on the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April for charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of greats like Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the Velodrome race, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can give top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
The uncertain future of a smelting plant in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of a power plant that supplies electricity and that has informed one of the owners of the smelter of the intention to terminate the power supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
This is happening after the Victoria Government had previously decided not to extend the grant that kept the company going.
The validity of a fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at stake in Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - can be put at risk when closed.
And since the smelter consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other avalanche effects.
Alcoa closed Point Henry in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoa's factory in Portland is a waste of money and is threatened with closure.
This is followed by several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to a strong Australian dollar, and recently due to the cost of production of the plant.
The AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley Valley, declared that it expected that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the small shares are held by Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "hedging contracts', which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the 2017 fiscal year ', the power plant declared.
Furthermore, any possible impact on AGL's profits since the fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written the value of the contracts according to its books of $187 million "in case of termination."
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract "had no impact on its ability to operate the smelter or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter."
The American company stated that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to start to apply from November of this year, although it still had to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle as a result of the weak economy in the sector.
The head of operations of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both companies withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer, "he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian Real Estate TV Show - now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the front page of the September edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, an ambassador named Estee Lauder, who performed on fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, when I look at this front page, I want to cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a sequel to the humorous performance of the Kardashians?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the baron troublemakers Rob and Caitlin, along with them all the favorite uncle of show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) had forgotten on the cover of their sister only so that the scene could end in a classic turn: they are preparing a secret party.
It's a story line of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the show at 8: 00 a.m.), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that other girls on this publicity could make a living.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we definitely entered the new era of the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pushed the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September edition of the magazine is a different league.
The September edition of Vogue magazine is the best-selling number of the year.
The publication, which by its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a wide range of advertisers (Fashion player counted that from 832 pages in last year's edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star, which appears on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that over the past two years the images of the magazine have escaped even before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities who model" on the front page than "models who are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, holder of the Oscar and ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the cover in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Laga Gaga.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - which the magazine describes as a "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, he will be in a very good society.
These celebrities are not related to known people, or the stars of real estate shows, or the kids of today, who know how to make a well-edited video (although Jenner represents all of this).
These are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymour, the original Victoria's Secret model in June, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the whores of the moment."
These feelings have rekindled with the news that Jenner will appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of a September Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who she took for Love magazine.
And in his spare moments, he's on a reality show, maybe just one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centres will reject 160 000 people per year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in the Community legal aid centres and are preparing for the effects of further restrictions on funds for services already extremely busy in the sector itself.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and people with no funds to fight unfair eviction and so on - are rejected when they are seeking free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to burst, are about to make further cuts.
Since June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal finances.
The Director of the Community Legal Assistance Centres in Queensland, James Farrell, said that, according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Assistance Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the federal government's decision to abort, the situation would deteriorate.
"The community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relations with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families undergoing separation, workers who are unfairly released - all of these people have legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30%, leading to thousands of people at risk from Queensland having to focus on complex legal problems without help.
We call on the State's Attorney and Senator Queensland George Brandis to immediately prevent this shortening of funds, so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the State has fulfilled its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a member of the staff allegedly pointed a gun
New York: The Donald Trump campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the Director of Operations in North Carolina in February aimed a gun at a member of the staff while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a court case that was handed over to Vincent Bordini, the former state's software campaign coach, at the Charlotta State Court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "this would not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "signaled a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's kneecap," said Bordini in the lawsuit.
According to the file, after a complaint from local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Guns don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The prosecution comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked an uproar when he said to voters in North Carolina that the owners and holders of arms could intervene (which is regulated in the US in the Second Amendment to the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and can appoint his judges.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump didn't defend violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini requests compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight and Phillip for endangering personal security, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to a comment request.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news office in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The phone call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not been responded in a short time.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is extremely attractive, just as London 2012 was, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were huge benefits for both Startford and East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there are those who will think that the Heathrow expansion is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in Heathrow it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, to grow by 211 billion pounds, to leave a legacy of skills and employment in the vicinity of the airport, as well as throughout the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which, in the time and with a budget set, introduced an infrastructure investment programme for £11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years in a row, to the T2 terminal, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they're ready to deliver a third runway worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London Games in 2012 were a huge success for Great Britain, and I believe that the expansion of Heathrow will be one as well.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, to secure trade in the future, and to leave behind the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Director of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game of cat and mouse in blocking ads
Attempts to bypass advertising-blocking programs have turned into a cat and mouse game for companies that make money on online marketing. At least one of the companies that program such software says so.
On Thursday, i.e. only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a post on its website stating that users can update the filters in their program and re-block the advertising on this social network.
On Tuesday Facebook stated that his desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims they've already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in the blog that "this kind of war between the open source community blocking ads and those trying to get around them has lasted since the blockage of ads was invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another one of its own repairs.
The fact that a society that owns the largest social network in the world has been involved in the war only proves how much of a problem blocking advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, last year Pagefair carried out a tker, and Adobe uses advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times that in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the profits from Facebook advertising, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker said that the company is going against advertising filters on desktops, because mobile filters for mobile applications for the social network and Instagram are not working.
Advertising on desktops still represents a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it will update the "ad preferences" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how ads are displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters are worrying about them, because they could also block content on the site that is unrelated to advertising.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," said the Facebook spokesperson in the e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, which is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences, which will give people control.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses to an event where a woman who was likely to try to commit suicide was run over on the highway on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on highway A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police said in a statement that a "desperate act" actor was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman at the age of 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to the police, they haven't all been identified yet. Police are calling on these drivers and everyone else who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said to Le Tribune de Geneve counsel Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the participating drivers will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out, "Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases from the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of a negligent death charge after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Paynerne in the night of August 2014.
The court said the victim was drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and passed out on the road.
The court found that a police officer - who responded to an emergency call - was in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone with information about a Thursday incident at Morges should apply to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerance city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (ACCA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague in Prague.
On Friday, the CEO of ACKA Kateřina Petříčková informed.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8th, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
About 35,000 people took part in the event last year.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised companies," said Petříčková.
According to the survey of organizers, foreign visitors spend 3100 CZK per person on average daily.
Special maps of Prague with a complete list of gay and gay friendly bars, clubs, cafés and restaurants in the form of mobile applications are available to gay tourists to support their travel.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in staying in higher price relations with high standard travel services and spending more than others," said Petříčková.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium takes place this year as part of the festival programme.
It is lectured by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also address several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
A traditional parade with allegorical cars will be the highlight of the festival on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The parade that thousands of people have attended in recent years will honor a minute's silence this year as a reminder of the victims of the June attack in a nightclub in Orlando, where the assailant shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat have been celebrating for 40 years.
The irresistible cutils Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained small and large spectators for 40 years.
The pilot part of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš was premiered on 12 August 1976.
After the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, there were cartoon jokes by artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who he invented for a magazine with two pieces by Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturg Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimir Jiránek to work together and together they created the film Kutáči.
Today's form with yellow and red trick and ball and radio was given by characters in 1979, when the series for Slovak TV began in Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the handlers in 1985, this time it was already directed directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other parts continued with other creators, many of whom were involved in Benes' son Marek.
There are now more than 90 episodes with the stories of these cutilas, where everything is falling apart, but they are never angry with each other and they are always full of optimism, ideas and Kutil enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which will prove a famous gesture... "and that is it!."
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatres, and characters or other toys with pictures of Pat and Mata are the hit of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two years of Harmonia.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen one sports and one life for you.
They both have a good ending.
So let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the country's joy?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what are the things people spend the most on at airports?
That's a Friday's review from the world's website.
First medal of the Olympic Games.
The historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Rugby's selection of this archipelago was defeated by the UK team in the finals of the Olympic Seven Rugby Tournament.
It's the first medal Fiji ever won for himself in the Olympics.
It took 60 years to wait for the first valuable metal to profit from the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji is taking great credit for success.
Ironically, though, it's British Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013, and after the finale as a British citizen, unlike his countrymen, he could be satisfied.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the finals.
In the end, Fiji has regained control, and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The French newspaper Le Monde brought the message.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who since 11 months lived without hands and legs, got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced, as her mother gave up for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her hands and legs and then sit together without the prosthetics.
In less than a year of life, harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis, with doctors only giving her a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got perspective, too.
I saw her introducing herself to other children with the words "Hi, I'm Harmony and I have no hands," my mother added.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we spend the most on the airport?
CNN is bringing in a finding that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson 's Travel Essential Stores chain has published data for the last year, where it summarizes 10 products that customers in his shops at airports buy most often.
The water was sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight of them were placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of coconut-flavored M & M sweets.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
It's the only thing you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines, it's US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The oars of the oars.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond were laughing.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have been sovereign in the category of two without a helmsman for seven years and confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, a dissimilar pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, in the Thursday finals, they took on the 69th prize in a row.
How are we different from the others?
We are simply prettier, joked Murray already during the Olympic Regatta when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
To be honest, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We just train hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray more seriously.
Their domination is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two meters tall and a 100-kilo chasm, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has, for example, a charity boxing match.
Even because of that, they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat basically saying we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who, even at the press conference, demonstrated that Murray was dominant in the crew.
He was the first one to answer, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, it destroys the opponents with a calm force.
They are moving at their pace, and although they are often not at the forefront of the track, the adversaries have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-kilometer track, and we never wanted to go the first kilometer to the top.
We're just trying to drive a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said forty-four-year-old Murray.
With his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Cup.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the golden four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, the biggest defeat of their careers was probably done and the dominance was confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was gonna be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were in a good mental state, said Murray.
We know everyone wants to throw us off the throne.
We still have the target on our backs.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Study have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once upon Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and saturated CO2, there could be conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of turning Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to be proud of a sparse atmosphere similar to the Earth, turning slowly.
The model also dealt with previous topography of Venus.
There were probably areas that were drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the Sun, which was 30 percent more dampened.
"In the simulation of the model GISS Venus during slow rotation exposes its daily side to the sun almost two months at a time," explained the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This gives rise to surface heating and rain formation, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and joins the surface before too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled a story of Venus similar to evolution, which was hypothetically developed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated and the water vapours were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped and only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that is Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as team coach Colorado Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as his coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations as reason for not being able to participate in the decision-making process on the team's issues.
The executive vice president / general manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the move and stated that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
I've been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is essential that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who received Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his team's benefits.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013 / 2014.
The team made 112 points and first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and over the last two years, it has not always worked out after the season.
The Avalanche team reached a score of 39: 39: 4 in 2015 / 2016 and was five points short to win the second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goaltender Roy, who signed up for the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil platform resume talks and interrupt the strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties have stated that the wage strikes for North Sea oil platform workers are being interrupted while all the parties to the dispute are meeting for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the Wood Group oil service company were sporadically taking place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current disagreements," stated in the statement.
Starting next week, we will have a series of whole-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to the trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30% in protest of wage cuts.
Wood Group reduced rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9% less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide the company with room to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell deleted thousands of people from his payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernise his processes - immediately following a mega merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
A member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disagreements of the entire generation, which led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as it said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said.
To compare, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of stars in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to assist astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rate of rotation of the stars from the Pleiades cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster turn at different speeds, and also how the rotation time relates to the formation of the planet.
"By comparing our results with other clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between the star matter, its age and even its history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher in the centre of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades Cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have been formed for over 125 million years.
Now it turns the fastest.
In moments of peak rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of starwind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star grows older, so does its rate of rotation.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on turning speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, making pirouettes bigger slower than the smaller ones.
"In the" ballet "Pleiades we see that slower spinning stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," said Rebull.
Since the Plyad Cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"Pleiades provide us with anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars," said Rebull.
There's still a lot we want to know about how, when and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and so say "hang their dancing shoes on a nail."
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the rate of rotation of Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then wouldn't there be a qualifying agreement, and after a few months, I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without applying to specialisation education after graduation?
My point is that, in the field I would like to work in, there is now only a job in a more remote hospital, but in about half a year, a job might be available in another one, where I would like to work afterwards.
So I do not know how to deal with the situation for about six months, and the question continues.
This is Mgr. Lenka Wolf.
No legislation provides for an obligation to enter into a qualifying agreement with an employer - hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure that the costs incurred are recovered from increasing or deepening the qualifications of the employee.
In the area of health, long-term pressure is being put on not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Pursuant to Act No. 95 / 2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialised competence for the exercise of the medical profession of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly true that participation in specialist training is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not an increase in qualifications).
This means that a qualifying agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs are at least CZK 75,000.
Nor does any legislation provide for an obligation to enroll in specialisation training.
The Act only lays down the conditions for applying for inclusion in specialisation training.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to practice the profession of a doctor already through the completion of the required university studies, albeit under statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialised competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation in which professional experience in another field of specialisation may be included in specialist training if its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the author's situation.
However, given that I do not know the specific circumstances of this case, consultation with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professionals) can be recommended, as the Ministry of Health provides, by law, a advisory and consulting service related to the inclusion in and the course of specialisation training.
The Czech Medical Chamber, which must be a member of each physician, also provides the advisory service free of charge.
The doctors from the Syrian Halab are asking for US intervention.
The United States did not make any effort to end the siege (rebel parts of the city by government troops), and did not use their influence to enforce civil protection, cited by AFP from a letter addressed to the White House.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and not even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over East Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," said the doctors.
Russian forces, which support an army loyal to President Bashar Assad, have announced that from now on, they will stop every day for three hours in the Halab region to allow safe passage to the humanitarian convoys.
From 9: 00 to 12: 00, all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
While the UN's Head of Humanitarian Operations, Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, he stressed, however, that at least a two-day ceasefire was needed.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the East of Halab, controlled by the rebels, turned to Obama in a letter.
It says that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel death of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world stands by and notes how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly obscured threats, mentioned by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors have reported 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria over the past month, of which 15 have been recorded at the hospitals they work in.
The most sad thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have young children coming to the ER with injuries so severe that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material we need to help them, to describe the doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the explosion disrupted the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They gasped for breath, and then their lives ended - before they could really begin to remember.
An army loyal to President Bashar Al-Assad, supported by Russian forces, has been surrounded in recent weeks by insurgents controlled by the East of Halab, with over 200,000 people indoors without food supply.
On Saturday, after three weeks, the rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian Air Force, managed to break the siege and launch an offensive.
Both sides then gained reinforcements in and around the city.
