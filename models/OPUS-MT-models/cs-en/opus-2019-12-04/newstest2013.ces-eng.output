Republican Party Strategy Against Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders have justified their policy by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre calls such fraud a myth, with electoral fraud less frequent in the US than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
Indeed, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of election fraud in the US in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states are responsible for organising federal elections in the US.
And in this spirit, most US governments have been declaring new laws since 2009 that make it difficult to vote or enter the electoral list.
This phenomenon recorded a boom after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 legislative proposals were put forward restrictive voting rights in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and a proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the term of the election in advance, invalidate the right to register for the election on the day of the election, and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The first State to implement this request was Indiana.
The constitution of the Indian law was confirmed by the US Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this process to other states as well.
Over the last two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states to force voters to submit photo ID cards.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any identity card with a photograph issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have such an ID card of about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the acquisition of the required ID card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions mainly affect young, minority and low-income persons.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are famous for their approach to democratic candidates are not allowed to use their identity card in several countries with a photo displayed by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who choose more Republican candidates to use cards issued by such clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no State required a citizenship document for elections.
The first such request introduced Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have adopted laws that impose an obligation on voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes cast by the Hispanic minority.
It must be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic party.
In 2011, Republican legislators supported in eight states the laws that abolish voter entry on the day of the elections.
In addition, they have limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, campaigns to register voters helped to register around 10 million people.
However, the measures adopted after 2009 led to a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws in the next five states aimed at shortening the election period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, African-Americans accounted for 33% of the voters who voted ahead, even though African-American voters in this state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanic.
They accounted for only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting ahead.
On the other hand, white people, who represented 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of those who voted ahead.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters opposed the passing of laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, even the Attorney General of the United States intervened.
They have partly managed to reduce the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have adopted laws requiring a photo identification card to be presented.
However, the newly introduced rules will make the exercise of the voting right undeniably difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics speak above all of the bias of approved laws and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
Brennan's 2011 report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 out of 270 votes in the electoral corps necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: do you have an examination or not?
The PSA test produced some incorrect results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this has increased the hesitation of men who were already so reluctant to even go to the exam.
Get checked out or not?
We asked two experts for an opinion.
Studies carried out in the US showed a high level of contamination between individual test groups, making it difficult to interpret these results and bring about valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, noted a different mortality rate between patients who had been examined and those who did not go.
This study also showed, after 12 years of separation, that those who do not go to the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
So I recommend a 50-year-old or 40-year-old examination if your next of kin had prostate cancer.
A more vulnerable group are also African-American men.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those that are indifferent.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer, which has no impact on life in the long term, and to focus on active disease surveillance in these cases.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Rather, we will propose active supervision and offer them treatment in case of progression of the disease.
More and more often, and with greater precision, we set criteria that help to decide which species to treat and which to not.
However, I recommend that you do the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with your doctor and to determine whether or not it is appropriate to have an examination.
In cooperation with the International Urology Society, Movember has created an instrument that allows the PSA investigation to be evaluated for and against.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research, the best way to reduce disease risks seems to be to adopt healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved sufficiently, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone had stopped smoking, this figure would have risen to at least 50%," underlines André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for the Canadian cancer research company.
By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes inheritance.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for the Canadian cancer research company, even though the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely damaging to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," the spokesperson André Beaulieu shakes his head.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer death is halved.
Weight
Body and obesity, according to SCC, are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," adds the report.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption it may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Sauces for which the same applies should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," adds the report.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory according to SCC.
Although there is a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer according to one of them, another study is more likely to talk about an increase in prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated either.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Subjecting yourself to an examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs boson examined
Announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by a standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But there is no 100% certainty among the physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume that this is the Higgs boson, because the risk of error seems small, and let's look at what this is really about.
In this world, there is an absolutely undeniable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
Next, the physical particles are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obey Pauli's principle.
And at the other end, there are bosons, evil anarchists, who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the facility (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesons that we leave unnoticed, and the "force particles" that spread the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson is likely to be related in some way.
It must be said, however, that these bosons are not as exotic animals as can be expected.
If you read this article, it's because of a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or a "particle of light," which is "carrier" of electromagnetic power.
When particles with electric charge speed up or change their direction, they "cancel" the electromagnetic field at this particular point, similar to the pebble thrown into the pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "force carriers."
More stable fields
It's also with the Higgs boson, only with the difference that "disturb" it takes another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; very high energy values must be achieved in order to excite it, like the frozen pond level, which only encompass a very large boulder.
For this reason it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large Hadron accelerator with friendly bundles is a circle with a radius of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Analogy with an electromagnetic field is once again useful to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, for example magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper for example will never hold itself on the fridge.
And anyway, with the Higgs field, all the particles don't react: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as photon, let's look at it) don't.
And Mrs Novak asks what all these research are for, what will they "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, this is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between observations and forecasts of SM.
In addition, few physicists literally want them to be found, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It must be noted that the model has so far huge shortcomings, it does not provide any clarification of gravity (Whoa!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of space matter (Whoa!).
However, the CERN device has not yet discovered such discrepancies.
Responses
The responses to these research in the daily life of Mr and Mrs Novak are very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be none.
Behold: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution that their work would incite.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the lab."
Just imagine...
Moreover, application can also result from all the tools that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his optics-oriented work.
This sensor, although Boyle didn't plan it at all at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his Commission on Decent Dying, Quebek recently involved himself in a delicate issue concerning the end of his life.
The debate should continue shortly, while the bill is being drawn up.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed it gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years to live, and it's already seven," he says without emotion in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: an enormous weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet or just eat himself.
He looks at a tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talking to unsubs who stop by him, bringing him drugs, offering him a bath.
Courage to a simple death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it degrades me," he confesses.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In all life one learns that men urinate standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
It's unacceptable for some people to go back to the stage of a child.
"Depending on the ability of the person," the psychologist claims to accept the return.
In the opinion of a number of people involved in palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter a home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from all cancer.
Their prognosis is at most three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them do not provide them with the so-called "healing" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die of "asphyxiation in full consciousness."
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says, and then she says, "Let's get her breathing apparatus on."
Yet he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the coming days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, care for the body is provided with the help of nutrition.
That's what palliative care looks like, which starts when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one bed of palliative care costs 11 700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a man dies, he can be given, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics don't have to keep an eye on their sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
They were carrying a beer to Mr. X last night, who later died last night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of the late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Nursing Services.
At the home of Victor-Gadbois, the days go one by one, but they don't resemble each other.
In addition to a 37-year-old man, who rejoices in his last encounter with his family thoroughly on his pillows, while they toast him in his honor, a tragically 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, dies after he has tried every opportunity to survive.
"For six months, there are always three to five beds, which are intended for persons with cancer under 45 years old," says Dr Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gadbois' home come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is designed to alleviate suffering as soon as a sick person reaches the final stage of his life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal Region, specialize more or less exclusively in care provided to oncological patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of health care in Quebec that leads to a number of doctors specialising in palliative care afraid of adopting a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, there has been a manifesto in circulation, signed by the tip of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec medical system is not efficient enough to ensure that all persons have access to high-quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R. in great pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to make her feel better.
He is concerned that patients will not be asked to be killed because they are not receiving appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists care for their patients up to the last moments, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she abandoned demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she said she regretted that I was stopping fighting, telling us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending doctors for not making their wish come true when a team of palliative pussies softened their pain.
It must be said, however, that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal Area, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives to put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by impact or whether the sedatives are given to him permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who won't get rid of pain will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to relieve me of my pain."
The implementation of this report has enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in Health.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel management officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political lobbyists and experts in the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters mix.
This "branch" came very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has crumbled since we took major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal ironically.
As a result, a scandal erupted in 2011, following a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which were approved by the then liberal prime minister of Quebec, Jean Charest, after long delays.
The "Duchesneau report 'confirmed a direct link between industry, the opaque financing of parties and the corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the 2010 investigation," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport has saved billions of dollars on orders," when some people have kept their instincts at bay to gain a stake in them!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already led two mayors to resign," adds with the hope that it will "uncover the cunning of some people."
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption established in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
On top of that, the officers of the "Marteau family" who, since 2009, have made sure that the Montreal "money pipeline cartel" significantly reduced the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, they've done a number of tours and indicted fraud and corruption on a number of municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban community.
The next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He's suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal accusations have also been made by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito created a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism for the "system" of procurement.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of the orders he received in Montréal to a mob agent who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000 and devoted more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68 000 euro) to the provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing illegal fundraising for former liberal Vice-Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines, the prices of which he exaggerated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very vigorously.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to excursions, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with cash ducts for which he exaggerated the price.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had been paid rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false multiple works.
The mayor's party organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of blatantly turning a blind eye to the parallel budget that was bringing dirty money to his cashier.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned early November, plunging Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Members of Montreal to give a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, it has opposed the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a thriving real estate business.
70% of dirty money in electoral campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that it "pulls the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of a system of infested ants to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
According to her, the process is "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up a private investigation unit in Montréal and to ensure that these dubious practices do not come back.
It's like cleaning up.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that 'public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars', but he fears in particular the role of 'Members informed of this ruse' if they have not become involved in this mess!
He estimates that 70% of the campaign funding in Québek comes from dirty money, and with irony he adds, "I hear it's just a little bit of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the party's donations to $100, but that will not solve the situation: "Until the election costs are severely reduced, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: 'We cannot go any lower; if we focus boldly on the substance of things, we can build again on firmer foundations and with greater control and compliance with the laws'.
If this story has blackened the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all those who mock him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone together, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day, I get further along with them.
The tech team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier when you're fighting.
Everything's going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
Ever since I started prepping at INF Clairefontaine until I transferred to Saint-Etienne, I've always moved on to individual levels.
So you're using a competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
Reinforcements from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater taste for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makelele, who used to play in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right moment?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
Today, he has no equal in the 1st League and he is among the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of degrees with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
I had a relaxing conversation with him in January.
I've had a series of injuries.
The trust it gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took our front position.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have moved very easily to the eight-finals.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
However, we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Port first, so we can play back the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order to become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
This is not yet the case.
On the financial side, the PSG has the resources to carry out this project.
And would it be a great failure not to win in the first league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had the power to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think we're gonna make it this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon, and Bordeaux are looking for the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expect too much of PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what's been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is, if we beat the Troyes 4-0 at home, and there's still something they blame us for in the papers, it's not very pleasant.
One asks what more people want from you.
You can't win 4-0 every weekend, of course.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved we could play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't fought his way into the 8-finals for the second season, and they've also invested large sums!
With the sums invested, you could expect to get ahead of the other 15 points!
That offends the other clubs and the French League.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not do well last season, moved with the new PSG to the next stage.
That shows how amazing the First League is.
I hope that we will be able to smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have succeeded.
It seems that the PSG relies on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahim in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's an "addiction to Zlatan."
This means that Ibrahim is very powerful and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's what he came here to prove he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect man and player.
Even he respects the people he has around him.
What he's achieved is truly extraordinary.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defensemen in the world, also allows others to grow next to each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French representation?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play the way I'd imagined.
But I've been there, and I've come out stronger.
Today, I also manage to play good games in the representation.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the representation.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our appearance exemplary.
How do you look at Didier Descamps' first months as head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We're in a good place in MS qualification.
Coach picks strictly, he's close to the players, and he gets excited about winning.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Descamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1: 1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting game?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a struggle in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks identified by transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true in these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (however convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between partners.
With 15 000 computers connected to the network, about 200 000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin rate first reached a maximum of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is at the border of about $10 (the overview of the courses is shown on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money," "competing dollar and euro" and "the equivalent of ordinary money."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for a video game that is acquired by a player or can be bought (and changed back sometimes).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are depositories of current account books, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two e-addresses by e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in a public account book distributed across the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, the investigator of which, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is the phase of cutting the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, then "chop up the whole."
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then appear indestructively connected to the string of all other transactions; any modification would result in a change of print.
If the user wanted to pay the same money twice in a row (within ten minutes) for the purpose of fraud, the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they can be divided up to 100 million, so the margin space is...
The difficulty of the specified task is also increased with increasing level of calculation.
The network has seen its ups and downs.
The sites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins stored were stolen.
"The used loophole does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a company for payment with real money used by Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, as a platform of WordPress blogs, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not run.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars has been exchanged," joins Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul dealing with the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a phone-free payment, but uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that make it cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up with traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement towards questioning hierarchical systems and moving towards more horizontal systems.
"By the time Bitcoin gets ahead, it will be a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapita and Surobi).
NATO and US troops should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghan people to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside, which we were punishing, suffered the greatest harm because we considered them terrorists.
And so are we, after all, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but they are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
All they want to do is defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French troops from the foundation of Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the almond mountain thanks to the French loans, took place in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles have arrived in Kabul without being attacked by air helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progress between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the ground was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their acceptance of control of the country was then considered to be a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan people have paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, which has been completely dominated by Al-Ka'ida, but their situation has not improved until now.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are in agreement in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The chief dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state land that they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them, moreover, have never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that won't be made up by thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have made use of American generosity will: capital evasion is considerable.
The young are tired of war and ideology associated with it.
During expulsion in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world, and its advantages attracted them.
About 65% of the population are under 25 years of age; there are currently 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to be given a job, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes cell phones; television and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand at her forehead be regarded as legitimate?
Former leaders of the fight against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias, which will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation in the form of Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state of strong presidential influence, so the Prime Minister's post, which existed since the Constitution was adopted in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced but fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumors have spread that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And it only fueled the feeling that the Western states were only here to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without resources to transport raw materials through mountains, however, no mineral mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine Mes Aynak and left the international archeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site to retain the role of the most important employer throughout the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on November 20th.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: the girls' and boys' lycea, the departments of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agriculture areas, the promotion of an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "get a heart and soul" initiative has been in place, trying to reconcile aid and military activities with the "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but has achieved a number of achievements in the area of common interest and agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a few French NGOs.
These works, involving a number of local workers, have helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of cultivated areas.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often at an altitude above 2 000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural assistance from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the uprisings led by foreign groups, these farmers, in their opinion, wish to achieve little civil assistance for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected by them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Morsi has started another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, irrespective of the opinion of all the others, that the Constitutional Assembly will approve the final text the day after tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the opposition's point of view, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "violate his word" and "trample the law."
However, his supporters assure that this is a means of curbing the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerating the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of clarifying the Egyptian text article by article.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is being swept by protests.
As he confirmed in an interview for the American Weekly News Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organised vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: 'You either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers', which should otherwise end after the new constitution has been approved.
Yesterday, in this special atmosphere, 85 Members of the Constitutional Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most liberals were absent in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was declared, they slammed the door saying they had no way of asserting their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities copied their move.
In order to achieve quorum, 11 alternates were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It will not be surprising that the articles of the Constitution have often been voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to argue that one of the few disputes on that day revolved around... hours of prayer when some committee members held the view that the clock in the conference room was not properly adjusted.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately identical to the 1971 Constitution and provides that "Sharia law principles are the main source of law '.
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term 'principles' with the term 'rules', which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" is argued by liberals who only see it as a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamisation of the constitution is carried out through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role on the University of Al-Azhar, in particular on matters of checking compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommiere, this is disturbing, because "persons called to comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy in this. "
Liberals' fears are fueled even more by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulams, but university workers, many of whom have studied in French schools, "underlines Alexis Blouet's concerns, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh '.
And in the future, there may be a question as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this. "
Yesterday, the approved text, apart from religious aspects, is highly criticised because of the extended powers given to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there was a significant reduction in them compared to the former regime.
Another contentious place: powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military officials, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, civil proceedings will not be prohibited in military courts, as required by human rights associations.
These associations speak of their doubts in relation to the text which they believe is directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is preserved and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, underlining Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on TV last night, manifestations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The citizens of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel wait for Ukrainian tourists holy places, navel world and sea from saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the size of biblical truths, modern comforts and pristine nature.
AaF identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bow to holy places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God's mercy will descend on all those who enter this "bath."
And Galilee - instead of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass through the Path of Pain or Jesus' Cross Way (in Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, it passes through the streets of Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's Grave on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian navel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross to the crucifixion of Jesus.
There is also the most sacred place in Jerusalem for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different creations leave notes with wishes, which will then be completed.
Entrepreneurship the path through the vertical
The ruin of Masada's fortress remained from the secret shelter from the enemy that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those involved in climbing can access it by their own forces.
The others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise there is a shuttle bus from the foot of the hill.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly living on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit everyone on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
In it are stored ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls, which were found in the caves of the Judah Desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
The Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented in his exposition.
In Akkon you can visit Al Basha Museum-Spa, which represents several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of spa users and spa attendants from that time.
In Caesar, the unique private museum Ralli is worth visiting, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or gift shops.
Admission is free and gifts are strictly rejected.
The Fifth Museum - Holocaust Museum or Yad Vash in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You step inside and you find yourself in utter darkness.
The stars are shimmering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also listed.
Improve your health
The three main spa centres of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, waterparks, delfinaria and oceanaria.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it is possible to bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The dead sea, by the way, is the most extraordinary sea in the world, located at the lowest continental point of the planet - at 417 meters below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps people who can't swim on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo treatment using saltwater - solanka, and healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchoconstriction, diabetes to treat your nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them was the famous sea path connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The references to this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Indeed, tourists love to wander down the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you press yourself against the walls in the alley of "your" sign, happiness will be in your favor.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesar - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesar was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population speaks in this country.
For the journey it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly bus, but there is a fast tram in Jerusalem and Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower town with the upper one.
It's basically an underground rope track.
Travel through all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday it stops working in markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts work week.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels, you will get only kosher meals: except pork, seafood, scales-free fish and meals containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus mash, various kinds of sauces, minced chickpeas - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fattened cats who "roam" gratiously according to their taste.
In the evening you can see him sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Leading cats love populated places and they like to get into every good thing.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day by car brand (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And it's going to cost about 15 shekels a day to borrow a bike.
The museum tickets cost on average 30 shekels.
Expressed by figures
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from around the world.
To get to know the country and rest came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country was visited from January to October 2012 by 118,8,000 Ukrainian tourists, 51% more than during the same period in 2010, before the visa was revoked on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MEPs and human rights defenders are still debating the compulsory language test law, there have already been imposters in the country selling "forged" certificates
13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December the law entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be obliged to pass an examination of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and communal economy, lifestyle and retail sales sectors.
However, the FMS promises that, over time, appropriate tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, trials will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
The knowledge of the language will also have to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not even subject to people who have successfully achieved an attestations and obtained an academic degree in the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Use, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass tests in all cities; already more than 160 such centres are open in Russia today.
Members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Services) also supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: and what does that actually mean?
What changes the duty to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, it is the responsibility of the migration service - it will allow the number of people suffering from "slave labor."
Many people are talking today about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explained by the Chairman of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan, Viktor Subelev.
The protection of their rights should start before they leave.
Only the system of organised recruitment will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be addressed.
Problems arise with non-occupational immigrants, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with confidence Sulev - the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a "voucher" to the terrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will spend months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their country, they promise them one thing, but when they arrive, they cheat them, they confiscate their passports, they don't pay the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Tajik Labour Migration Administration of MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear!
The less so that many Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for work recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get into, but do not even have the experience of the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, but rather their misfortune: very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children grow to their working age, they have to go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of language, it's difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, in the light of the language test law, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out for migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't take the exam, they won't get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally, just as they used to live in Russia.
"Welcome, or Forbidden Access."
Many of the incoming workers claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and that results in blackmail cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - he shared his experience with journalists, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuskhadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the validity of the Language Act, it was found that false documents were not only the documents of the registrants.
FMS staff have already confiscated several false language exam certificates.
The forged documents are printed on a common colour printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope of making the test problem easier, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times the amount of the official test: it's going to cost the migrant workers 3,000 rubles.
Thus, the main task of the immediate future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply purchase documents, in which case government officials and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests at the first time the time they needed to take a course on the basis of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active human interaction is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not circulate the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using a legally held weapon is very low
The MVD of Russia makes a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
It is a response from government authorities to recent events: the stimulus was to shoot at weddings that were without casualties, and a massacre prepared by Moscow's attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, whose result was the death of seven people.
The police want to ban the use of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a license to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and the fight against corruption by Irina Jarovaya, who promised that changes to the arms law would be presented to the Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws."
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organisations - demand the rejection of the "senseless tightening up" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminalist in an interview with the Russian editor of the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior, 142 firearms-related offences registered by the Ministry of Interior authorities were committed in six months of 2012, while a total of 1168 000 crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening civil weapons legislation will not force the perpetrator to switch to the "black" market.
According to their words, any weapon at a low price can be found in Moscow at the moment.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
"Black" arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says the retired colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot sites that receive weapons orders
The first one - "military or military travel," that means a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The guns were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasus itself," says Baranec.
Another type of "black weapons" is weapons stolen by criminals in the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the law enforcement authorities.
Illegal "mainly" is being sold from military warehouses.
There are often explosions in many military warehouses.
"It is proven that some fires were set deliberately - to cover up the manka," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, the arms manufacturers also make their contribution.
"At present, private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market are being set up and disarm the weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," this expert says.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of guns and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in small production, and a mafia was created that organized their continuous production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up what is the approximate share of the various sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Design of Public Administration.
Specialists discussed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, listed by researchers, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market 'because of officials whose work is linked to weapons,' is said in the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons are from armed conflicts, 14% have been stolen in their production, 5% are "black archeology."
The arms dealer who asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the dig by black "archaeologists" are no longer bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, vendors drive for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
He buys a unit through the ensign, like a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes her to the city and sells her for 900 euros a piece with two containers," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever a plan in the clarity of criminal offences begins to burn, they will carry out control purchases with illegal arms dealers," adds the consultant.
"It's like a luxury store."
Sellers and buyers most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I was visiting websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Trial" platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the "corner," where we'd be dealing.
The price I learned was there
Military Rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, tells the salesman I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him fully.
The vendors are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically, "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to say that my daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I'm going to get there through the person I'm sure of.
He'll only deliver them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he processed the state for publication on the subject.
The schematics haven't changed in his words.
They gave him an album with photographs that said "everything you thought."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," says the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baranec, does not offer a rabbit in a bag - you can try everything out.
I, a potential client, I just don't buy -- we go into the woods with the seller, and we build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start to act," describes the expert's procedure.
Seat tray
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to websites and groups to "Contact" where you can buy weapons "for various purposes."
There's no need for documents or personal encounters to do that.
"All you have to do is have a defined amount of money," it says in the ad headline on the website "Buy a fighting gun or a vending machine."
On this website users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course without a license," asked the user "Ivan" (spelling is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moscow" - briefly worded the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently derailed a huge network of planted websites, and the people who wish to buy a military weapon can take a shovel.
People rush like hungry fish to bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military officer Viktor Baranec
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment via the ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photograph and a description of where the gun is hidden," says the press secretary of the NGO, "Right to the gun" Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will usually pay an amount of between $100 and $900.
In the words of Dmitri Kisla, a non-governmental organization entitled to arms, you will have a $100 to $300 Makarov pistol.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon shall be dispatched from warehouses for long-term storage through central cell warehouses.
According to the official statistical authority, the number of these offences in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period January-October 2011 and amounted to 22.9 000 cases, and the number of explained cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fastfood workers and supermarkets strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through the work at the McDonald's cash register.
In recent days, America has seen a wave of low wage protests in Walmart hypermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or whether it is destined to perish soon.
This share is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries received by ordinary workers in Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, seized millions of inhabitants and, in some cases, accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some Walmart workers, working around the world for 2.2 million people, abandoned their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational business chain companies whose goods are intended for lower and middle class people.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its shops are 8% to 27% cheaper on average than in large supermarkets.
That is why many low-wage employees in Walmart stores only buy from themselves at work.
The availability and assortment of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply partly because he pays little for his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't correspond to the amount of expenses, the employees say.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is, on average, 1.1% more than this company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart transfers the wage increases fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart's defenders point out that the protest was only held in nine countries and society should not cause virtually any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8: 00 p.m. Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
Overall, its cashier's cashier made nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
Dan Fogelman's representative stated in an interview for the left-wing Huffington Post website that jobs had been abandoned by a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all about "another media sensation" organised by the trade unions.
"A vacant cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart department stores (those in the advanced city are not very popular and therefore are hardly here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick pay, and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, city council member of New York City
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal law and New York State regulations.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only moderately, and on average their regular workers in New York receive $8.90 an hour.
In this dear city, no one has a lower wage.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York with that kind of money.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind a part-time post-school counter and live with their parents will get a job at "McDonald's."
Few people see their main livelihood in it or plan to stay there for a long time.
At the moment, I am constantly meeting with "McDonald's" workers who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal Forum, there is a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which started at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast food businesses begin to receive at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be set up in the area of fast food.
US law prohibits the administration from preventing the establishment of trade unions and punishing trade union activists by bullying and firing.
On the other hand, governance rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is also difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food businesses for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of employees.
Non-consent
On this day, noisy protests took place in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of this event was the "McDonald's" meeting near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, especially a member of the city council of Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick money and pays you properly for your honest work! "
Demonstrators have also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for mayor of the city of Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must act together to support fast food workers in order to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity, as all New Yorkers deserve!"
As the New York Times described, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, although by far not all of them were fast food workers who employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event becomes a spark that ignites the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has managed to deceive on average."
Among the fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular topic of extended reality; recently it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft also submitted a patent application.
The interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi shows that glasses are already a thing of the past for the scientists of this company.
They are attracted to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us, in general, what is your research group doing?
- We're dealing with human interaction with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stuck in a phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most it touches the screen with its finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without the Kinect sensors, because it is very interesting for everyone to be able to drive by gesture.
- What else are we gonna do in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred interaction to physical levels, very many interactions are still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow so far has not been separately.
We're trying to change it, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
You have to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because we do not always want to inform others in our neighbourhood about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for the control of equipment in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not about swimmers, just about such lewd, short ones.
The gestures would not be reduced by a camera device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's going to be very difficult to tell.
So you want to get the user to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at a given moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's mutual bonding.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.
- If you are to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can bounce off of in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's like matrix and depth.
In the current view of the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - it adds work to algorithms designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z axes.
So the velocity, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and the current data flows 30 frames per second are frankly a little low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes made our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra shots per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now being used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And the third camera - it's actually a common visible-band sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue system Kinect, play with the curvature of the camera location and see how this helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present his glasses publicly.
Don't you think that it is one of the most promising platforms when it comes to the everyday use of advanced reality technology with special glasses?
- Of course walking and constantly holding a smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful option would be the "portable" form of the expansion of reality, where it would be possible to switch from the glasses to the smartphone at any time, the projection screen, and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time also weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the widespread reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think adding tactile sensations could easily be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is being used - the use of the second hand as a kind of background for displaying.
It records the compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactile to these "images in the air" - for example, interference with several directional ultrasonic rays at a defined point where the finger is located, it causes a tactile feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you were blowing on your tummy.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here there is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a man who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If deceiving the brain becomes a target, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes virtual reality work so attractive to researchers - many things are in complete beginnings.
Vkusovsky instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "St Petersburg avant-garde," dedicated to the citizens who are leading, is the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list there were already significant figures of St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the ubiquitous reputation.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - the bearded man who's all dressed up in red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, the one at the Summer Garden, the one at the fashion pubs and the opening.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're exposed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical Petrograd storytellers, the creators of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is a conspicuous man of Petrograd avant-garde late '80s and early' 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of citizens, increases everyone's mood.
He recently took a flashinet into his hand and became a Saint Petersburg flashiner because he matured into this complex role with his whole Bohemian life, philosophy, and image.
Cyril, why are you walking all over town in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color as the designer dealing with the look and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although in general, everything that is slightly different from gray is a wake-up call for aggression and a wake-up call for bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on getting an interview.
The whole history of my provocative acts is, above all, an invitation to debate.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my work was exposed.
I understood what my path was.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists crossed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I became friends with artists of new waves, with post-gazonevs who led us to "Pushkin's 10," and there were no other waves.
It lures me to the theatre, to the dressing, to the music, to all genres except the word.
And it all merged in your art clinic... it was important for me to find myself at the centre of the culture of Peterburk, where all the best powers of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I took a seat on Pushkin's 10, and there was a music-art club, a Bohemian club, a home of the Peterburk Bohemian before the reconstruction.
There were many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Shnur was brought with the project "Echos Van Gogh."
Shnur and his friends sang light songs under plywood, dressed in tight leotards, among them composer Igor Widoin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many of the programs of the Haliv times.
We gave them Trachnberg, thus starting his great career, basic education and training he gained from us.
Gallery "D 137," club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and our regular guests left.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 he held a survey was in the press, a special prize was "People in our city."
In the nomination of "Artist of the Year," I was named, ending my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits in which current and penetrating are captured live.
I'm going to have a program show called the Russian Clown Museum.
Clowns are an timeless category.
I used to be social. It's painful and terrible to be like this.
But in clowns, everything wipes, tragedy takes place.
I love grotesque, I get grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today, people meet by clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
We've seen you recently as a city flashinetarian.
And who should be, if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
Back in the day, people would hang out in a bunch, bohemian loved one simple other person.
Today everything broke down on microsociety, today it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to make everybody like me.
Today, you have to wonder who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to Stas Mikhailov!
It's where the groupies come in. It's where the social sphere gets involved.
And 300 people come to cultural land, and 10,000 people don't come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything goes to waste.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one can fool them and break what's experienced.
When I was young, I used to paint pictures that hung on a collector's wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say, "Spiritual culture, consumer culture."
There is no consumer culture, that is from elsewhere.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money to draw paintings.
And I'm all for that kind of culture.
Cyril, what's the shortage in Peterburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is this notion: an explorer through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the time of proper Tsar, it was not in everything, the Tsar may not have understood culture very well, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
In St. Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they're stuck in a corner because they need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right track.
Today, tasteful is thriving.
The same Erarta, but it's different because they're honestly saying that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburk is?
- Peterburk - it's not the capital of culture, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's the right soil.
And on our eels, art thrives poorly.
We need cultural ground, but there are more writers here today than there are readers, that is wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In my country, a layer like that is just weak.
We need art to become a fashion thing, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the resources of the St.Peterburk grant
To be born in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The spaceships with earthlings on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how do you keep your family in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think the selection is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars," says the senior scientist of the State Astronomical Institute P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while the conditions for life are better on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures are 500 degrees Celsius.
It's only possible to live there at high altitude or orbit Venus... in space.
The question of reproduction in the universe began to be addressed by scientists with flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was carried out in orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent to space to verify how the embryo develops in a weightless state.
We get a perfectly normal bird on the way out.
But then trouble starts.
"The problem arises that this bird must find support, stand on its own feet and begin to move," says the chief laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find support, the birds will fall chaotic and do somersault.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds were completely destroyed by their instincts.
The birds didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the trouble was, in four days, they just died.
"We had birds hatched twice, but then rejected it because it is simply impossible to work with them there," comments on the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last mini-ark with the animals went into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
But only one-sex beings will be in Bion's biosatellite.
There's been an experiment with rats that have been beamed into space already gravitational.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such experiments must be conducted," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, a child was born to space rats.
But it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot implement their sexual instinct when they lose their normal environment.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens dominates abstract thinking and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest threat was Tereshkov's.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our tea flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it could fly into space.
See if she can deliver a baby after a flight like this.
"No one has answered that question yet," says Vachtang Vacnadze, the veteran of the rocket-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkov, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savická was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in an open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who, after long years, were born and grow healthy offspring.
"Moreover, it may be dangerous even in orbital years," states the astronaut-pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia Valeri Poljakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here in conditions of zero attraction, astronauts embrace the habits needed to work in the open universe.
The water mimics a weightless state.
Although water is a comfortable but strange environment for adults, it is a natural element for young children.
Little ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and that it makes it easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks will elapse.
"It is very little for a child to forget anything," says the instructor of the swimming newborn Marina Aksenov.
In short, if the weight-free state is more natural for a newborn baby, then for women, the natural inevitable gravity, the attractive force, is more natural.
In a weight-free state, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, decline in the ability of the body to expel the fetus very quickly.
We can put that aside if muscle stimulators work in childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism will expel the fetus.
"What else?" asks Valeri Poljak complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by the Earth's attraction, it cannot form the skeleton or the muscle system properly.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which to train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs to develop.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the environment here," predicts the head of IBMP RAN Igor Pestov bioethics committee.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when it will become a reality and when earthlings will embark in their ships on a far-off planet that will be home to their descendants born in the universe.
Head of SAO: System control failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and good legislation in relation to public procurement, but it lags in its application.
In an interview for Upstaalne.cz, this is what the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala says.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what I think is missing from us," comments Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also suggest joint control of Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Netime's approach to the so-called "Svarcsystem."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with his checks - is he therefore forbidden or allowed?
"After all, the law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the operation of an office which is obliged to go to check and enforce obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared public procurement legislation in both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
The simple point is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by national legislation and then also practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the check is not yet completed, we have found very interesting differences - generally speaking, legislation is perhaps even "stricter and more perfect," but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but to pursue the application of the law itself.
What good is this project to you, what does it do for you?
It is such a common control that could help to stop making efforts to improve legislation, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Serenity means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by reducing the limit on orders, we do not necessarily have to achieve that.
Maybe the system will get overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw much easier from it than if the limit were to remain higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transfer of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, like the SAO, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, it only forms in a slightly different way, but in principle the two authorities are similar.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but because Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has these accounting courts at the level of the individual Länder - in this system is a little different from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the counties and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
As far as the legislation is concerned, it's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some ways Germany is called a role model, but it cannot be said that it is better at everything.
Is it necessary, then, that they have better controllers?
I certainly don't, but I say again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it has to be said that even the countries that we consider to be a role model are facing a wide range of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any good for them to work with our office, would it?
With regard to domestic legislation, what was the amendment to the Public Procurement Act to your office, are there already any impact on it?
Since the duration of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet present in our control events.
Since we do ex-post controls, there's a certain delay to be reckoned with.
We are only looking at this in the process of preparing future checks - we have launched our new instrument of identifying the risks of inefficiency, over which we have passed nearly 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - where, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
So, do you consider the approval of this law to be more of an asset or an additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
A problem that may arise here, that the rules will be "tightened" and it will not be possible to follow them.
Even in the course of the operation of the previous rules, audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it therefore worth tightening the law in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who commit formal errors that have no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see which way it doesn't go.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneur by checking the so-called "Svarcsystem" - and what does that mean?
Is the Svarcsystem forbidden or allowed?
After all, the law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the operation of an office which is obliged to go to check and enforce duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and we'll allow it," but he can't say we'll do nothing.
There are rather strict rules in the Public Procurement Act on how to formally implement what is to be done - which is right in order to protect competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the best bidder is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what I think is missing from us.
Roads are sometimes frozen, but mostly mobile
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are off-road, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region, roads were empty this morning, but sometimes frozen and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should warm slightly.
The snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Erzgebirge Mountains.
The locations were also lower visibility due to fog, resulting from the traffic control data of regional road drivers.
The R6 and first-class roads are now available in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also eligible.
However, in some sections there are still residues of frozen snow and places of travel.
Especially in higher positions, you need to pay more attention to driving.
Pardubice and Králové Hradec Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frost, in higher places and in the mountains there may be a travelled layer of snow on roads, informing the Road and Motorway Directorate on its website.
The road drivers warn the driver against freezing, it can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitviv or High Myth, especially on the roads of second and third classes.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 at Svitov are treated chemically.
The snow is mainly on roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Knežnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia it is most often clear to semi-clear today without precipitation.
The temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with a faint wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are available this morning, but with extreme caution, the weather needs to be adjusted.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures range between three and nine degrees below freezing.
After previous snow and subsequent cooling, some communications can be frozen.
The places must also include fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is based on information from the county road patrol.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, but the communication managers recommend increased caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, there may be frozen sections in southern Plzeň and Tachov.
The communication of the second and third classes is humid and also in this case the warning for frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent journeys in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc Region
Today, the road's snow mash must be counted on by drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region.
After a chemical sprinkle, she remained on the Red Horre saddle and on her way towards the Videl Cross.
The road driver was driven into the field during the night of the snow, and on the Šumpersk, according to the road manager, they snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the region, the roads are usually off-limits.
"In Šumpersk lies remnants of snow in the highest positions.
With the snow mash on the Red Horre saddle, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník, "said ČTK dispatcher of the Šumper Road Administration today.
Their colleagues in Jesenick went into the field at night, the roads up to ae highest positions are now, according to them, after chemical treatment bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are open without restrictions, but in Switzerland, drivers should be careful in the forest areas where the roads remain wet.
Ústí kraj, Liberecký kraj
Several difficult places to ride today are reported by road drivers in the north of Bohemia in the morning.
In addition to several places with snow or glacier, the road from Telnice to the Moustache in Ústeck is also closed, resulting from a police database.
The temperatures are held even in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
The operational complications are not yet reported.
The occurrence of the iceberg is reported by road workers especially from around Szczeci.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for her at night - rain and melting snow during the day, bright and cold at night.
From the main moves are also reported adverse conditions on the road I / 13 at the border of the Ústí and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to the Moustache was forced by bent branches of trees that bent under the snow to the road.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we humans like to catch on to.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make more fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a nationwide fund-raiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11: 10 a.m.
3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will take place in parallel on the day before 20 December from 21 pm.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, and then we came up with everything together with our artist, Honza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think, together with the public, about the state in which this world will one day be handed over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world that people can also support by buying at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called "end of the world" anthem.
She's already very popular on YouTube today, will she sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in a complete conclusion, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be sung by all the interpreters at all three concerts simultaneously.
All of a sudden, the hymns are connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech TV.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the video played by Tomáš Hanák, singing in it also Xindl X...
How did you get in with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
Turns out most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's the benefit from the concert against the end of the world?
To equip the barrier-free education centre Studeo, which we have been implementing with the citizens' Association Tap in Jedliček Institute for the sixth year.
Teachers regularly visit the schools of Jedlicek Institute and engage in activities they enjoy and are interested in.
The students themselves do not have the means to go as teachers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
Within the construction of Jedliček Institute in the future, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
A number of music groups and interpreters will perform at each concert.
What did you choose them for?
We've been trying to put together a program that will reach out to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Dry will perform in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any similar "bombast actions" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will also prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are in the USA, would like to link this to the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these paths logically and organically?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric cart, her carts have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we carry a large amount of cargo and tools with us...
However, so far it has always been done without problems, both ČSA and British Airways have been perfectly prepared for us, that I have wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, which we came back from recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in handicap-free, public access to disabled people and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than we do, we have seen in Russia that everything is still in the east in the very beginning.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric cart to move himself in the city centre.
There's no such thing as a wheelchair choice in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we still have to catch up with more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind in...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that even people with a heavy handicap move separately in public, can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in which we are a little ahead of schedule with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or for barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become major athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers, things start to change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I started as a tutor at the Jedliček Institute, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play a saxophone, among other things, so my colleague and I started an interest music club.
Well, over time, as our host Ládya Angelovich says, things got a little out of hand (laughing).
But popularity hasn't come till the last few years, has it?
It's true that it helped us when we started to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the band.
We realized that a job that you can't see, basically like it doesn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is full of things where one imitates the other.
It's kind of logical, all new things are taken care of, and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap are one of them.
The first impression of the person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But that regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for the whole company.
Did this success also benefit from the fact that you are a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
When we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and demand some discipline.
I mean, that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic imagination and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the exam twice a week, to get the medicine and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, they are quickly abandoned by enthusiasm.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap band currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, there's no way to stop it.
If you have will and taste, you always have the door open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012 from 21.00
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be joined by the telemost in singing the song of The Tap Tap "End of the World"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds to equip the multifunctional barrier-free education centre STUDEO at Jedliček Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under the age of 12 have free admission tickets in the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, Poland was adopted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (following the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the following years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
The Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Sternfeld in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entrance to Cosmonatics.
The ideas of a young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award for Entrance to Cosmonautics in France.
The commemorative Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of the cosmos and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925, a railway dressing was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to start the dressing room or to stop it.
Information about this dressing room is only known from the period printing.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to engage with missile missiles.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uarmarjenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of the prakzický examination.
However, the arrival of the German troops has interrupted the research.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the expert press and in the following year the work of Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietoblub lotnicza by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocký came out.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work, focused on all military applications of missile technology.
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended with the beginning of the war.
Further work dedicated to the cosmology appears after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautyczne Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a mention of the company in November edition of 1954 of the issue of the issue, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, is proposed the creation of a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has tried to join the International Astronaut Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn, PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Atomic Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been a major part of the development of a very successful weather missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The 1800m rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rocket flight tests began in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 4 feet long and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Another development type should have been able to do real scientific work by now - the RM-34 rocket should have reached 14,5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
The first RM rockets were followed by the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types were developed (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0,4 litres, a Meteor-1B of 0,34 litres and a Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, a Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg up to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later is still to be mentioned.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites under the Intercosm programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Act on Public Works.
The resolution has given rise to a lively debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in constant conflict between themselves.
The principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital is the cause of this, along with unprecedented financial speculation.
Due to considerable differences in labour price, (wages) price tensions occur.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer tries to compete with imports of cheap goods by "undermining" the price of the competitor in order to tear down more market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either translating production abroad, or buying it cheaply, or dying. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
As private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment generated by it, the state's social spending is necessarily rising.
The whole situation is exacerbated by the sheer reluctance of business masters to pay taxes, thereby compensating for the economic and social social social damage they have done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
In individual economies, reckless private capital practices create a situation where national governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to their own population, regardless of the social downturn.
This is particularly reflected in the changes to the laws in force.
The aim is to force the own population to accept the private capital price dictate, in particular, in the area of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and, on the other, by limiting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with an increase in differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been many years of public food dispensaries for poor people who cannot make a living on their own work.
The number of these people is already going into millions.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are very common cases where properly employed people receive such a wage that the State must pay them to an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures of virtually all of the southern EU states certainly lead to the same situation where, under the pressure of a disastrous decline in the social level, people are forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to live on the margins of society for starving wages in the hope that private investment capital might come into the country someday.
Here, however, it is necessary to ask where it will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wage.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media are saying that the state cannot participate in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital, however, insists on the opinion that the State must not intervene in the economy by managing the intervention.
Then it has to be asked whether private capital is affected, and now it is actually running a policy and thus the whole state in its own egotistical sense.
There's an unequivocal answer, isn't there?
Proof is the existence of virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, by providing mutual benefits, by legislature, where virtually everything is punishable, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is that state ministries, because of the lack of funds, are putting in place draft laws to private law firms, which are in close contact with industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western-type constitutions do, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly entering the situation, as Appian described in his work of the crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disintegration and the authorities have been filled with violence.
For bribes, illegal favors, and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were uninhibited, and the people went to elections with a pre-sold voice... "" The people of character did not apply for office at all, so once, as a result of this coup, it was a state of eight months without consul... ".." Indeed, it began to be said that the only cure in a bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man... "Appianus thought of Pompeii, but he became Caesar, who changed democracy into a self-government.
As in antiquity, the current company is based on a reckless preference for its own benefit, regardless of the social interest.
Private capital is no longer, by its very nature, able to understand and exercise the social benefits.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform the deeper nature.
We must therefore look for the causality of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At present, the demise of these systems in favour of liberal-type democracy can be seen as a break with the expectation of another round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites completely ignore possible hundreds of thousands of casualties in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and European level, the government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social standards of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence and can never" "Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is" let's not forget how fragile we are "
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no" dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions have emerged.
One is behind Israel, they argue its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians belong to the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, they argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel belongs to the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the recurring waves of killing, and who is the victim, after all, Israel's current inhabitants, including self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
My point is to offer readers a view behind the curtain, a look at who has been serving 95 years of lasting tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding of who, virtually which group of people is the main mover of modern history events.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the power struggle.
In every era, we can track down one of those Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities who have been absolutely autonomous in controlling their actions, or whether there was someone behind their throne who was directing their actions to a predetermined goal.
We have to admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lives of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, there is one that could be considered the head of the octopus (if anyone else is standing over them, but I'm not ruling it out) - Rothschield.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
The first Press Agency (Reuters) was already bought in the 1990s to stop the merger of its name with the highly criminal acts in which they stood and which always meant the consolidation of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have the main shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the shares in the central bank do not lead or prepare wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Qaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia was subordinate to the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the central bank status of Rothschield Bank of America, began to issue his own (understand government) money during the Civil War and was murdered in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, he was murdered 1963, MEP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by the Masons Supreme, 33 degrees dedicated to Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second to remove the colonial manor, especially the UK, and the third to lead to a reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a precondition for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families led by Rothschieldy works is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see FED's establishment, so that crises like those triggered in 1907 do not repeat).
So, after they managed to start the First World War by assassinating Habsburg's successor to Ferdinand's throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsar Russia by launching a Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended in sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender by Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia), followed by the fragmentation of Central European power, Austria, Hungary.
To facilitate the start of World War II, policymakers allowed politicians to create a latently conflicting situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating a precondition for radicalisation of the impoverished masses, and then simply subjecting the Germans to a strong enough, guilty, and simple solution to offer the Fuhrer, and creating a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also to play, the fifth column function, in starting a war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferentially in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration has already created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population have begun.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler went off the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or everything he had done was difficult to predict, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration created a precondition for accepting the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations made to Germany for World War II, a third outbreak of war was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If international bankers can unleash it, the Jewish people, like in the other, will be victims in the first line of battle, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country, but also internationally (let us only consider how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice begets injustice in an endless chain of violence when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power at the beginning of everything stood?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like in our country, international bankers are only pushing their own candidates to choose in elections.
The current prime minister of Israel, the Hawks of Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascist, loyal to international bankers, a politician who does his best to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to grow into a global conflict, and with Iran's control over the Hormuz Strait, which travels 20% of all world oil (the navigation corridor is only 2 miles wide), as well as the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appears the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a completely controlled being.
"And he forces all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have a brand on their right hand or on their forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of its name.
This must be understood: whoever has the brains may add up the numbers of the beast.
The number marks the person, and it's number six hundred and sixty-six. "
Movie Argo: When the worst is, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students captured the American Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Rez Páhlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would put the trust of allies in other countries at great risk.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was deepened by the fiasco of an attempt to liberate the hostages by force.
The prisoners of diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after the Algerian government brokered the negotiations.
Their fate at home has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iran debacle made a significant contribution to losing Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film of the directing actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of that history that brought a small victory to America.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped.
After complex peripherals, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping with an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as film crew members who were in the country looking at locations for making sci-fi film.
Combinations of genres
The plan developed by the expert on "exfiltration" by Tony Mendez also required Hollywood cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, the film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie," the story of a successful stunt, a backstabbing, can be an example of a series of Danny's partners.
In the film there are alternating moods - on the one hand documented sequences from Tehran (in the subtitle sequence are shown iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, light passages from Hollywood, dealing with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in the halls of the Bureau, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed in a remarkable way to restart his career.
The mocked actor became a respected director, and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first picture of Affleck that doesn't take place in the director's home Boston.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, reconstructing real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also mediates the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history moves out of nowhere.
Affleck and his coworkers achieve similar effects in fake scenes (fake crew on Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
He's been working almost successfully with it, sometimes thinking about reality - everything doesn't work out so well there (a scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport turns off a call in America and a runway chase seems pretty far-fetched).
But the weakness of Arga is the fragmentation resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charamant in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and are not by far the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film kind of loses a dramatic pull, it's a picture that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciates the implementation and retro style of evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
It's hard to tear it down.
As a reminder of one so far a certain way of living history, as well as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but they will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankrate.com, which announces the most absurd banking fee every year, has now decided to launch a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop."
"We were led by the last event where the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher.
Among the nominees of absurdity, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women in the price of life insurance have been favoured because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013, "informed Nacher.
The controversial EU regulation also includes mandatory incorporation of biofuels into fuel, which is detrimental to nature, and the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Critics previously also faced a de facto ban on the use of the expression "spread butter" or the elimination of classical light bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of the trade or industrial lobby, the requirements of which are usually defended by a state or group of states in Brussels (so the Czech Republic now also advocates the demands of its banks by the threat of veto).
The interests of the lobby were also supported by the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to be at least 14 cm in length in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomalous curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission resisted by harmonising the existing non-uniform national standards that complicated trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU despite the resistance of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation may also be the candidate for a victory in the poll, according to which the sales of inflatable balloons must be made compulsory to warn children under 8 years of age that they must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred here to American research, according to which balloons between toys are the leading cause of the death of children for asphyxiation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under the age of 14 when blowing in pilgrimage stunts.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves - anyone who has an official position in the EU, in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, cannot use the name Macedonia and must speak instead about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bank Charge.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated a Union regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State, in addition to some of the above absurdities.
The EU has set maximum levels of food stocks that could be located in the Czech Republic on the day we enter the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The poll organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries to have no sea and the idea of granting subsidies on request to obtain subsidies.
However, these ideas were not created in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund, "said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of so-called intervention purchases, he was to stand full of warehouses which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros to keep the Czech Republic in port.
Finally, the European Commission came out to meet the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, managed by Minister Pavel Nědek (US-DEU), specifically to write up a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easy to criticise in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to operate and develop the Union as a whole are worthy of recognition, according to a number of experts.
The more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the use of EU subsidies for projects that have no indication whatsoever to do with the deepening of European integration, but that have been imposed by the Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions among the Czechs also arouse that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, and it will not always succeed in this match.
After six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs defended the name of Olomouc shapes, but the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed a tuzemák by our manufacturers.
The designation of rum can only be carried by cane distillate products and not by sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the Marzipan of Lübeck or Parma ham have already found themselves, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, the horseradish and the Třeboň carp as well as the Zatek hops.
The EU trade mark can also pride itself on Pardubice gingerbread and flue-gas pipes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Senator, what makes you think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If things work out in our country without a problem, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country steal away for the last 20 years, as thieves run around, people's taxes and retirement age increase.
I shouldn't have been an ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent non-party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Aren't you turning your back on the people who elected you?
All this time, I've been saying that I'm going to fight for the Castle as a result of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool for how I can realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is, however, not only do we, as a nation, curse in the pub and television, but we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
This will be added to the media, which do not degrade people and which mistake freedom of speech and freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to be bribing journalists, or that I was an advisor to George Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have embarked on the battle for the Castle with a thesis of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and return returns of over 20 million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
But as president, you do not have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How are you going to solve this?
As a citizen, when I lobbied for a guide to be a free trade, I managed to get it through.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good suggestion from left or right, they deliberately reject themselves, and that holds up citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My priority is that without partisan enumeration and dogmat I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourselves more like a right-wing man or a left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that I'm more of a left-handed kind of guy.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also be against the wrong idea.
You get so worked up when someone says you're a populists.
But you're not proving what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some might call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about already work in the world, or are spoken of by major experts.
But without Parliament's support, all you'll have is passwords.
And with that, you can't keep up with politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to impose criminal and material responsibility, for example?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists, and the public, and try to get them on our side in order to push it forward.
If I were elected president, there is no problem holding a live television broadcast where I will ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to enact substantive and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to tell us why they don't want her.
If there's a strong personality who names the malfeasance, you can push on the political scene.
Take the direct choice of president, that was due to public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I have only just started in politics, and I will try to get majority support for my programme.
I try to move things myself, if I can't, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, which is why I've been going around a lot of known people, wondering if they'd run for Senate, too.
I went to Radim Jančura, he refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenca, who was covering up the light fuel oil fraud.
I ran for people to be really unhappy, but now I'm on the fence.
Sixty percent of the people didn't go to the election, and those who went usually chose the representatives of the establishment.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People voted for the Senate by making changes difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you thinking of setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to look into the pure past of every potential party member, and I don't even have the money.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have land for about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Superb Damage for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I've always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against bad things and bad things.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million worth of property, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put much of your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
Am I supposed to be in debt?
I've hit the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program might not be that interested.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign out of my own hands.
The campaign costs will basically cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay my son's English school, which is 30 grand a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to keep these activities down?
But that has nothing to do with the salary.
As promised, I partially subdued my activities.
For example, the travel agent will be my deputy in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much were you used to taking a month as a businessman?
Two hundred to 400 grand, which I take further.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You'll find the entire interview in Saturday's Issue of Law.
The architects of MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not take place only in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"I find the building cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally, something interesting is to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, means, "Of course, the house is nice."
However, I ask you why we still need a library today.
They all have Internet, iPads and e-books.
No one volunteers to any of these old-fashioned libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a settlement in the vicinity of Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not even worth visiting, holds a special record.
This community with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate throughout the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and build seven nicely painted iron concrete miniatures of fictional bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not dizzying.
And so city councilmen knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architectural Studio MVRDV, master of the insanely bold bar graphs and contractor of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with the usual calm and at the 2003 competition meeting he appeared with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the committee looked around and crouched its shoulders amazingly, the insolent Maas threw his gifts at himself according to size and ended his activistically justified speech with the words "Dear Town Municipality!"
So this is my proposal on Spijkenisse Book Mountain, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a EUR 30 million mountain was designed.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Mountain of Books was awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which has not yet been able to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an extremely ugly city hall, whose white facade you would rather expect to see a dairy house, is a bit richer by contemporary architecture.
But, above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of its existence.
Long way to the book
First impression: reading eldorado under the cheese hatch.
Through the massif mountains ride an elevator, but you will discover real space and reading passions only when walking through topography.
On all sides the glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt cabin and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is usually uncozy and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classical spatial configuration upside down, and we pushed the space for readers from the inside out.
The interior of the Book Mountain is well used: offices, Internet library, chess club, ecological centre and home technology centre are located on Wednesday.
A special comfort is the black shelf for books that are once covered with walls, once with a parapet and sometimes with railing stairs.
The appearance, the structure and the odor are foreign.
Even sworn architects and civil engineers twist their heads over unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, the project leader at Spijkenisse, on a question from Standard magazine.
And so one day we encountered a suitable agricultural waste product in a Friar farm.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, it has been used as a foundation under the roots of a millimeter fleece of synthetic matter.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
Thin textile lasts one or two seasons and then is ripe to be thrown into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in this quantity - was pressed on four centimeters thick plates.
The effect of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP), turns into a dark, homogeneous and burdensome material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
Up 105 stairs, you can reach the top.
At the end of nearly 500 metres long pilgrimage, you will be rewarded not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and ficuses in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially about the proper humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It's drowning and cooling through the Earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under the glass hatch, the sun shines in only briefly, even in sunny days.
The wide glued wooden ligaments, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shielding and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg "the long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to dedicate one book to his personal fund.
In this way, the optical gaps in the library, which currently contains 70,000 pieces, were to be filled first.
The concept has proven itself.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think that because of our invitation, every citizen now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This succeeded the MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called identity formation in the expert jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated she is.
This is finally the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have a bigger role to play."
Germany abstained in deciding to accept Palestine.
According to an expert in relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Szabo is thus balancing Berlin on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observation status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis were doing in Gaza.
But now Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libya uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO pushed it.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still settling in, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, like they have in France or the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows readiness to adopt positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners in the case of national interests.
I think that Germany's foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China, or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to scare away the public, but also the elite in Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a part.
But I wouldn't want to put too much weight on it either, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
In any case, however, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany's relations with the US been damaged when Germany abstained from voting on both important decisions, for example, when voting on Palestine?
I think that there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the US for the German position.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a breakthrough as it was in Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even benefit from some respect.
This indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly spoken for veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of US internal policy.
I think that the Obama administration seems to have a deep understanding of the European position.
But, as a result of the political situation there, it cannot, of course, hold this position publicly.
I think that the differences in opinion really aren't as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very happy about Netanyahu's policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does it even want to take on the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany accepts a larger role, anti-German moods arise.
That doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
It is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The US's influence in European policy is now steadily declining, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and it makes them even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is a sign behind this, which is officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it shall enjoy protection as long as it is not sued by the actual owners of the mark.
And even then, it's not clear if they can get the law.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in Taylor Wessing's office who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
Counterfeiters need a few more letters to sign their plates.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prado, they will have Prada-Kns registered.
In this way, German companies, such as Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder with a stamp office record in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the brand name Zegna DF Puma protected there. An artificial name that parasites even on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey department stores in which counterfeit goods are sold almost exclusively.
But Pattloch's cases are different. Under the authority of their mandants, they are opposed to Chinese companies receiving completely officially the right to use a label that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
That means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It hurts business, we have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The mark will be diluted, the exclusive position will disappear, the damage to the image is immense."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest-growing market of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, the deletion of dubious records in the register of brands is difficult to achieve, and it costs something.
The procedure can extend up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed the action because the alleged name became a "market reality 'after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
Known cases include graphic items.
In 2009, Daimler lost the legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sana, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of pumps for the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
In China, Lacoste's fashion goods manufacturer lost to the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and premises.
But last year, it was said that "the process of working has returned from an emergency situation to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
There are still 81 500 complaints pending at the office.
It's expensive to do something against it.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were received by the CTMO, which is almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China, for the tenth time in a row, has a list of new applications all over the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trade marks - 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan was levied on the fees.
This simply means that each login on average costs 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
There are several times as many times as the case of Freudenberg, as the case of the German family business, points out, to start the dispute.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
While the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitation car parts has been abolished.
However, the forger maintained Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget this ourselves, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanna Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The stamp office of the CTMO then rejected the objection of the Munich company.
While Freudenberg has acquired rights in two other instances, the opponent is still fighting the dispute today.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now under discussion in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that this will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archive they even had to examine the 100-year-old files to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterparty in vain a "high six-digit amount in euro 'to settle the dispute.
"From that you can see what it means to us," Wentzler says.
The danger from the Far East is threatening to hit Europe, too.
And that's when impersonators get unprotected marks.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to register Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business activity was long abandoned by the group, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch's attorney advise German businesses to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international stamp rights. Foreigners should rather "everything worth protecting in any way, even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg, in the last act of its brand drama, falls under the brand, then the opposing party will probably have to pay royalties for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pushed off the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Stomping, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Immongi choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, orphans of parents who died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that surpasses much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there's stomping: cowboy high boots, basketball boots, women's shoes and men's moccasins are looking for tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise.
The 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopf, almost picks it up from his textile shoes when he connects the voices with his soft, wild gestures.
It's Monday night, at the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology, the Immongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers and singers came from 23 to 69 years old, from human genetics researcher to caretaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir voice has a different text and also in a very foreign language - zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesothu, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Assistance to self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS control program, estimates that around 34 million people are infected with HIV worldwide.
Of which 23.5 million live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245 000 orphans from parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans of parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, he found the Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second-degree school.
A patronage can be taken over for 15 or 20 euros a month.
He guarantees a kid tuition, a school uniform, and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-Centre.
Immongi means "storyteller" in the language of the zulu, or "one who praises."
No one can speak in this space, only to sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, and sometimes it also brings them back to where they originally came from: the south of Africa.
At 8733 kilometres from Heidelberg, there is an Esitjeni village in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, which is dependent on the power of the German congregation.
Forty percent are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay or straw huts, a large proportion of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjen you can see in small, the same as all Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which has proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not acceptable to the population.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity within them. It is no rare thing that they die in less than 30 years.
This village was discovered by the congregation in the spring of 2005 in Africa. Above all, however, members of Immongi saw many children on the streets, who were lacking not only parental care, but everything: food, clothes, education.
Without an completed school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
At first it was also a private commitment of individuals, which, for a few euros a year, allowed the child to go to school and give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, a "Voices for Africa" corps were established, which since then has been taking care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI includes syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPI are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Munitions and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the most disabled group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch's Institute assumes that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, there are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, tricycles, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is spread relatively little among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20% of newly infected HIV people belong to this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomaviruses often occur among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infected more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than a year before.
What symptoms point to STD?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulties in urinating, discharge, abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore not be observed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The risk of infection may reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnosis it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charity gifts, and last but not least to the royalties the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
"We have already sent some EUR 200,000 to Esitjena," says Annette Lennartz, Chairman.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can assert herself.
It also ensures that orphan children find shelter, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as they say in the Zulu language to old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure the children showed up in time for school every day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the sorority as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school, built two henchmen, and together with the American health organization PSI ensured that many people in the village had taken an HIV test.
Even though the disease is so obvious in the whole country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, because it has to do with sexuality. "
In fact, it's pretty strange in a country where the King officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King of Mswati III, is known for its immoderate lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life also bears the blame that HIV has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "
In order to promote cultural exchange at least a little, the Immongi Corps travels once every two, three years together in the South of Africa and sings songs full of grief, fighting, confidence in the future and the confidence of the black people, which many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the black language - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but has also eliminated tears from many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Even if you can hardly find this village on maps, it is more than well known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is the air line of 8733 kilometers from here, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is on here too.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there was ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The American National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as is apparent from three studies published on Thursday by the expert magazine "Science."
The Messenger Probe has found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet that lies in permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not put the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leaders of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to clarify how water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and little robots like Phoenix, unnoticed earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, little windows to endless lengths.
The film came from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, except that dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, circling the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new conceptual definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This cut from the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identified are pink-coloured "newborn babies" in the birthing hall of stars.
This area where stars are formed - scientists unromantically call it W5 - discovered the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation at a distance of 6500 light years.
This changing heat of a dying star caught the Spitzer telescope of NASA.
The dolly ring consists of material that the star threw out during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5400 light years away from Earth, a new star is formed from gas and dust.
A photo of the galactic cradle was taken by the Spitzer telescope NASA.
A cluster of Pleiades, also called "Seven Sisters," is visible to the naked eye at night.
The telescope, however, makes the colours better.
The Helix nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity to Earth's continent has brought out this nebula named North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of extraordinary discoloration.
This "baby" among the stars was able to scan up to the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope in its full glory.
Saturn and its rings: the way they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps it's the remains of Saturn's moon that disappeared four and a half billion years ago without a trace.
One of the biggest and sharpest images of Hubble's telescope: the vortex galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxies, according to their colours, become real pieces of art.
The footage published by the European Southern Observatory shows several thousand light-years away the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular), because the dark stripes of dust divide the glowing heart of this star maternity ward into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonos, astronomers photographed the omen of cosmic rainfall: at 400 million light-years from Earth, the core of two galaxies blending together, and must inevitably collide.
This star's birth was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy of the M83.
If you don't like technical acronyms, you can call it the Southern Wind.
Photographs from Hubble's space telescope show the cut-off of the Iris Nebula in Cefea constellation.
This 1400 light-years-away nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever-new increments.
Also, this star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, gives birth to ever-new young stars, which are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
There is no dust yet in this bright, shining galaxy with a small black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe it was created only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo, Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical binoculars have been increasing - and the views they provide are becoming deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world has been for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
There's a Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona.
It allows you to view the universe using two mirrors, each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The Mirror Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its average is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
At a height angle, the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed.
Its particular feature is the high intensification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, equates to the world's largest mirror binoculars.
Using a radio telescope in Arecib (Puerto Rico), scientists in the universe are searching for alien signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In "Search for Extraterrestrictive Intelligence" (SETI) - searching for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner who makes his computing performance available can help.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's Vera Large Telescope, and he's honoring his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the ESO Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is designed to be full 42 meters and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the pictures can be counted against in 2018 at the earliest.
Two of Keck's binoculars on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcanoes were considered to be the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space using Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
There's also a new giant telescope on Mauna Kea with a 30-metre mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, Hubble's cosmic telescope provides us with the most significant impressions from the universe.
The images of distant worlds have been given to us since 24 April 1990.
The Cosmic Telescope Kepler has been searching since March 2009 for extra-solar planets - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the beginning of the mission.
Last preparations before the Kepler space telescope is launched are documented in the picture.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board Ariane5 in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists say there's ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as Messenger is circling around this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown that there is ice on Mercury for several decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe that was launched in 2004 and is the first to circulate around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be biblical.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be biblical.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call it a wild romantic ride on the mountains of Talyš.
The minibus rumbles along the road with many turns along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost looks like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the final south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives a Caucasian ethnic group of Taljys, which is not very well known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijan, and they live to be very old.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is hailed by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is somehow not suited to the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arriving from the capital of Baku in Azerbaijan is too difficult.
For 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours because the road is only one-lane.
The fairy-tale wealth for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is, however, convinced that Lerik is capable of becoming a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have the oldest festival in the world next year," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of nearly eight dozen Taljys from around here, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had a child.
However, the sports star of this museum is a shepherd of sheep, named Müslümov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
However, the birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely dubious.
"Born in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayev explains.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children.
So was Müslümov wrong at his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, the Gerontologist of Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about age-old people in Central Asia.
"Apparently, many elderly people live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia lives extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of background, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people around Lerik live to see the biblical age visibly often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why do so many old people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijan Guide to Farid Mugimzadeh explains the special genes of the Talyans.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatulyeva Museum believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of Taljys, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, does not seem credible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayev.
At 97 years old, it is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a buttery tree that she keeps swerving tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirsayeva and a daughter. Both are already grandparents.
There are two little kids jumping around.
The kitchen serves tea for guests, which is served in typical bellies of "armad."
The white teeth of Mirzajeva form a perfect line and beneath the scarf hides the long dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look like I was wearing paint.
"I've never used shampoo either," says Mirzajeva.
A monthly pension is enough to live
She only ate what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my whole life, I've never bought food in a supermarket.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst part was World War II.
But everything got better when the oars were taken over by the "beloved father" Gejdar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 managers (approximately the same amount in euros). This is for the local situation, from which it can be well used.
And perhaps even the long-grey son of Mirsayeva is right: "Old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they're loved, cared for, and they're happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is lacking in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The heated demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep ambivalence.
The future constitution, based on Sharia law, is being debated sharply.
The Egyptian president did not spare the pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, before the people and before God," he said on national television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but especially to Christian Kopts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular individuals.
All of them, so far hopelessly quarrelled in confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" of the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost excused himself to say that he temporarily restricted the constitutional court's competence and extended his powers to "save the revolution."
But what a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of a doctor of the American University in Southern California really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear on that.
Is the judiciary to be stripped of power?
234 paragraphs, which were quickly approved by the permanent Constitutional Assembly with the majority of Islamists in a 15-hour night marathon, are of some concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this unclear wording and the associated legal freedom to interpret Sharia more harshly.
At least this is illuminated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in a country with great influence on Sunni Islam.
That may not be the case, but it may mean that the clérus will exercise oversight of legislation, which would result in a de facto withdrawal of jurisdiction for the judiciary.
There are many things to interpret in the draft constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts is to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's governments to suppress the opposition.
After the collapse of the dictatorship, there were up to 11 000 civilians in military custody.
As it stands in the proposal, the state should also protect the 'true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morale and values'.
This is legally worded so inaccurately that, using this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, it means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph defines in writing the explicit equality between men and women.
However, another paragraph prohibits the defamation or defamation of the prophet Mohammed and his emissary.
But what remains unclear is what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally doubtful that the wording is forbidden to "insult people."
In this case, is the caricature of the president or a joke enough for law experts?
The issue of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Morsi will put forward for signature and, in his words, will 'very soon' present to the Egyptians for popular vote.
"The revolution has returned."
For several weeks, opposition to Islamists' odds has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual conformation on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to pay.
"The revolution has returned, and we will prevail," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who placed himself in third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former Managing Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej declared that the draft constitution belongs "to the junkyard of history."
With the short news service, Twitter has accused Morsi of wanting to make a coup against democracy.
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Opposition Member Jasir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood declared a defiance of demonstration, but not of caution in Tahrir Square, but of mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists who cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called on Morsi, "Purge the earth," and they made sure that the Qur'an was our constitution.
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, where everything began, would probably create a state similar to civil war.
Morsi's supporters clearly didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood has declared that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now it is time to let the people at the ballot box decide which way the country should go.
A majority is considered to be certain in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear once."
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, rages Hafize Abu Sa'du.
A forty-four-year-old human rights advocate and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim Brotherhood members when they were in prison or in court for Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that, he was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned.
"And now in the new constitution, the words' human rights' are not once," he complains in an interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
Morsi's extension of power to all three power elements in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous sin against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, de facto abolishing it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, watching the fight of the ideological factions in the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
The demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian coffin: The most stinky fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to a local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it alone for a week.
This gives you the smell of the paralyzing smell of the coffin, one of Norway's greatest delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a wonderful view - and there is an ubiquitous odor in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to stink.
As it gets dark and it gets cold, the Norwegian people here in Fagernes are starting to meet at a festival dedicated to this, as best can be said, the most captivating food.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General," who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can beat the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when poverty was in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, fish were soaked in air-tight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses were no doubt dulled with alcohol.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Noros were forced to leave their country and seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings, and an extensive system of care.
The people of Sweden, an old rival, who was much richer than Norway a few days ago, are flowing into the country for work.
The coffin is viewed as something important, indispensable, albeit rather smelly part of the Norwegian past.
It's one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 a piece.
Norway often does not get into global reports - and it seems to the majority of the population is satisfied.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still insensitive here.
Instead, the shooting is called "the July 22nd event."
The Norse can hardly believe that in their peaceful land, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of Nordic prosperity.
We are, as you say, wise people.
Her English, like most of the people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - apart from a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial collapse was throwing money they didn't have, the Norwegian had a tight cord on their shellfish.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and take trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat a coffin," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of the coffin.
I'm sure a moose burger like that is something else, and it's pretty juicy.
But in the evening, the stinky fish is back here.
The hotel I live in is one of many places where a rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast in which a butterfly host is surrounded by a plate with a coffin.
It's like a Eurovision singing contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man may fall out of his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexico's incoming president, Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC views the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that is clogged even at the best of times, steel barriers have been erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the nation's leadership.
He's facing a challenging challenge.
Mexico has done well in economic terms at the time of the resigning Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already been estimated to have killed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, a human and vast state surrounding the capital.
A direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him well.
Citizens attribute him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new motorways that Pena Nieto had built. These motorways are a huge improvement compared to the leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
Plates with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring about a real and lasting change," says Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, State Member for President Pen Niet, Party of Institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Member Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected from Enrique Pen Niet inside the party.
And he refuses to express the opposition characterizing the new president as a man with no substance.
He's a very straightforward man, very preoccupied with the country's excellent vision.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Zahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Tucked under the highway overpasses in many resembles the suburb of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a vast waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, over 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the notorious city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, the critics of Pena Nieta say that they failed to deal adequately with the problem of the murder of women when they were in office.
And in a worse case, his leadership is accusing him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a decrepit neighborhood, Irine Buendia shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna, and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been washed," remembers Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of blunt force trauma, and rigors have already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, with one word on it: "Justice."
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker and a whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority during his time in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," says the member of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the victims' families in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, says the military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of gross custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis of the gross treatment of Manning in prison.
The Private is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest spill of classified material in the history of the US, has missed many opportunities to complain about the rough treatment allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor has Ashden Fein in cross-examination of Private Manning at the preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during nine months of custody in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about mistreatment.
The cross-examination that took place during the hearing on the defence's motion to dismiss the case against Manning due to gross treatment at the time of the detention, which in itself is sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, went through the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning at Quantico detention facility, where he was held under a high security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that he considered the treatment of his guards to be "excellent" and the overall treatment of the facility to be "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints about mistreatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the way he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed concerns about the various problems orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not note these problems.
"They wrote" no problems "(after discussing concerns), and this did not necessarily mean that I did not mention them," said Manning.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The army stated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under supervision because of suicide) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a detention facility at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and passed out once because of the heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening to the outside world was very daunting.
"My world only shrunk to the base of Arifjan, the cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that he spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, robes, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against regulations.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint against the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made in Thursday's testimony regarding that, after being forced to sleep in his cell naked one night in Quantico, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates in the morning counting.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket.
In a Friday's interrogation by Judge Manning, he stated that he had decided, by order of his guardians, that he had a blanket to cover up, to put down, but admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the other night because he tried to show an officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told an officer he could use his underwear belt or his shoes to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his robes, and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his imprisonment and that, in the case of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be reduced significantly.
The defense has stated that Manning is planning to plead guilty to lower crimes and to fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the terms of detention as justified.
The Pentagon has made a statement that Manning has been held in accordance with the regulations on all arrests in maximum security custody.
The charges filed against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, the unlawful publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information concerning national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he's charged on all counts, he can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of possibilities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; remind them of the hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made it through the crowd, and I arrived in the immigrant agenda area, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and all my life I've been called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic acronym, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish," and my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Italians."
So later on, I ended up marking "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and got in line for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment that the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama's White House this week.
They had the usual issues on the agenda when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as to travel to the United States.
It wants to join with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war on drug cartels, even though he didn't provide any details.
For Mexico, a relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leaders, under the threat of weapons, to rewrite half of Mexico's territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think for centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the US representative says something a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaint about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will set foot on the warpath.
And yet Mexico's real challenge is to relate to over 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people whose country offers options, and others who don't.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent, or a grandparents who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, the origins of a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we live the American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat, and they see us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they never would have left it.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally travelled to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans dislike it.
Even if she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know do not feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best from both countries, but you don't have roots in either.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "temporary ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure it's a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for how they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel they still do not vote for the way in which their family members were treated in a significantly closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such thing is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary conjecture of who started it, many buildings were transformed into ruins, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
It may cause their struggle to be even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that it might interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there are not many reasons for optimism at present.
Even if the cease-fire closed on November 21 would last, the fighting this week has strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even if Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most pathetic and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently being run by its entrenched Fatah rivals, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a re-resurrected regional power that once was Israel's closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas's side, as did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering people of Hamas say that the Islamic Crescent revolves around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah's party / militia rules over Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism, can take down Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.
And, above all, on the south wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central Arab countries, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player that cannot be ruled out by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel's anti-missile system, the Iron dome, has proven its worth, and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last round of violence.
Most importantly, Israel prospered, particularly under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Even though missiles from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be the Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their lawlessness before international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, at the beginning of the campaign until the elections held on 22 January, joined with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they were really ruling on the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing missiles like their compatriots did in Gaza?
We better keep them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than all its four Arab neighbors combined.
The launch of a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments heal their economies.
President Morsi's cooperation with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire is a good sign and may mean the start of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, the denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination is creating a powder keg that has to explode one day in areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that blew up in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is making this situation even worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years to push Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need incentives from outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and the newspaper: two states where Israel passes the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping fire will give pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must pursue a halt to arms supply to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
The outsiders must also press for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has his part in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first parliamentary term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back at the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That is pitifully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the laws on ugly cigarette packages have entered into force.
On the unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are displayed warnings for smokers and sick body parts.
The Australian laws on ugly tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, have entered into force, and the logos and colours of brands have replaced universal olive green boxes with ugly images of sick body parts and depicting children and newborns sick as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between boxes is the name of the marks printed in the same small font since Saturday.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by depriving this habit of its attractiveness.
It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking until they're 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even for very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them along with their product," says the Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will result in serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette wrappers to cover up disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal regarding the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico had sold almost 6 000 units to wholesale retailers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible setback, experts report the popularity of social media in the demographic group targeted by the plan.
After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most retailers hide cigarettes from direct sight, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is an insurmountable place for you to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman has seen an increase in the rating of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza."
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves cigarettes Marlboro and took the job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it will deal with the new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of Australia's countries are trading significantly.
The SOO decision is expected to be taken in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has been conducting talks with other governments that are considering similar laws regarding packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered by Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and push the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a picture of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says it's harder for him to put them in shelves because of the single boxes.
"It took me one hour to unload, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should simply ban them completely, and then we would say," OK, that's it, we close the shop, "he said, and he threw his hands around.
It's not so bad to be bored in a world of constant connectivity.
I spent the last Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and child development experts increasingly come with the praise of boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of Boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, he has a boring long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating back to the first century AD.
And then it's also a question of how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After viewing research literature and presenting ideas to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was unable to."
Boring is different from apathy by not being involved in anything, but wanting to be.
He says there's no need to do anything about apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "the disruption of the attention process associated with the bad mood and feeling of slow passing time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see a problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see a problem within themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Body in Terms of Attent," published in September in Perspective on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which the person read the article from the journal.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly, they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, the disturbance may lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "like finding bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and scribbling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to wiggle will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all had boredom - my flight delay, a humming speaker, especially a lengthy movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of being bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the "Boredom Proness Scale."
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991 Reed Larson, Professor of Human and Social Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found out that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and doing homework while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3% of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the percentage expression of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knew that "growing up is a prime time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boring good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to play gambling or to abuse addictive substances as a way of mitigating them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is a way of telling you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you're bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your kid is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate management is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will learn not only to entertain himself, but to gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of reach of constant chattering of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, they said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise shuts down."
There's no manual in Colorado regarding the new marijuana bill.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and a football player from southeast Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - possession of a few grams of marijuana and pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he went with some friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and drug-use equipment - minor offences for which there is USD 100 for each fine - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on legalizing small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the site rather than the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana possession offences have already been lifted here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults 21 years of age and older for possession of a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and they are still accusing people of possession.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver are voting towards the western mountains to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is developing so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Even regulators in the state of Washington gossip.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use, and now also recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent for us to follow," he said.
The Washington Law, I-502, is taking effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, for example how to balance the state's directive on a "corresponding approach" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 metres of schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to place licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Legal Cannabis Centre, a recently established research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers, informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute for possession of small amounts of marijuana in every citizen over 21 years of age, and that the police would "immediately" stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that he would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In the District of Weld, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a more rigorous view.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way of pushing users to seek treatment.
Currently, they face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana by 119 people, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences which were criminal offences at the time they occurred," said Mr Buck in his statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer accuses adults of possession of small quantities.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but he also decided not to reject all pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55% of Colorado's voters supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed a deep division between local officials in view of this great state green experiment.
For the district attorney, it's a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendants of marijuana possession, and a local spokesman for the National marijuana reform organization.
"They spent so much of their life prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first countries to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their way to becoming national drug legalization testing cases.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while, at the same time, they are fearfully awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still intends to regard marijuana sales and cultivation as federal crimes.
Defenders of marijuana legalization are hoping the Justice Department will submit.
Despite several arrests of marijuana dealers for medical purposes and patients using it, which attracted attention, the federal government mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to break down doors to capture a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana deals permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratorium on any new marijuana trade, even if it takes about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that it will enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we give someone a license and then we get a big federal thing out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the municipality voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Not only today's university students are attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest seat of knowledge, a modern oiled Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks of taking up Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my bags, and ran into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard reported that I gave up because I objected to making love to students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson made a clear statement that I had left because I was forced to drink out of beaten cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was Margaret Thatcher's senior advisor and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
You can ask why I'm bringing it up now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right of the centre suffers from similar persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gay people, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR at Corpus Christi College claim that, because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and are shown not to be welcome."
They ask for the establishment of a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
The recent BBC Two documentary series entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Fairy Country: young, intelligent and right) on student political events, which he described to the Conservatives as weirdos and neo-Nazis, did not help their situation.
The show presented a graduate Joe Cooke, former Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "scapegoats" because of the introduction of higher education fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday newspapers that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us. "
A 21-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unpleasant," while 19-year-old president OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that there has been a deterioration in the approach of JCR members towards people on the right from Wednesday.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the welfare of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I started in September 1986, 18 years old and mortified in a shy way.
Hate against the Conservative Party was the most feverish.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse the former student Margaret Thatcher's honorary degree due to cuts in funding for higher education.
Even Stalinists would tremble with fear from the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students met with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the pellet that was supposed to come.
I find that not only do professors silently approve of the taunting of conservative pupils, but they are keen to participate in it.
A policy of mining strike, privatization and government resistance to apartheid sanctions in South Africa was introduced into the wood of the panned auditorium.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the 18th century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty good at it.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake dough, was very gallbladder.
"Thatcher refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were giggling.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, that is, if you're not too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room, crushed.
I sat alone at dinner at school when I felt a slight pat on the shoulder.
He was a sophomore student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later at the local pub, I cowards tried to pretend.
I insisted I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics, who (what irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students used to keep track of him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before liberal legislation from the 1960s.
Can I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they developed as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of those who write her speeches.
He was barely there.
He hated this place for its provincial and petty nature and for its inclination to a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he joined the post of professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said, pathetic.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes got sad.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a Conservative Party supporter, succumbed to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the course of teaching, when another professor of history declared in complete seriousness that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing with shame inside, I confessed that my parents had brainwashed me, and I called them "old fools."
The relief was short-term.
A nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was nailed by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week for Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and five minutes later, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snot wuss.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poison in an educational institution.
But even more tragic, it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 conservative prime ministers, but also, to date, is hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Fashion Design Master," which started this week in London, ABC spoke to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designer customers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the Valentine Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the beginning of the glorious retrospective "Valentino: the master of fashion creation," which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist that could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3rd, is filled with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "Bohemian elite."
There's nothing wrong with loving the royal family.
"At least they don't put a cigarette in your great carpet, like some wonderful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and' 70s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy a lot and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to glory.
And he's still a star. "
Valeria Mazz is performing Valentina
Not even Argentina's model Valeria Mazz forgets about designer charisma.
"It's been many years since we went to his place for dinner after one show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and between us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decor, food, music, everything he saw and felt his spirit.
All those invited could feel important and loved by him, "remembers the top model who started working with him during Paris's Top Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
A show of nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but a true love-back.
He loves people with good manners and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a distinctive 70-metre-long passage that offers a role change: a visitor turns into a model and marches through a passage to observe the "audience" of dreams that Valentino's masterpieces wear as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti wore in "Noci," or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience of mannequins, names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and Designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "it can't be forgotten."
"I remember it perfectly.
It was pants, shirts, a "gillette" vest and an autumn-winter jacket from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me, "says Naty Abascal, one of the designer muses.
"I prefer him to others for his femininity and great love for women, because he underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, they light up a lot and give a" spark "face.
Proportions are perfect. "
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
In the end, it was in the late '90s.
"I bought my first Valentino dress to celebrate my cousin Prince Edouard de Ligne's castle.
It was a red dress that had a dress with a call on it, a curly bodice, and a top with no straps.
It was a dream that came true, "says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat whose life depends between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories that they have in them."
"King" fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Pavel Greek in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstress) were needed to create these silky ivory-colored dresses with their sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and four-and-a-half meters long.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents the landmark of the ultimate fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of high-society clients."
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honours in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and decorated by the Order of the Legion of Honor, gathers as many honours as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always attracted his selfishness, serenity, modified and perfect appearance," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was great, time left no trace of him. "
When the princess says so...
The hardest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the Kawah Ijen Volcano
For four euros, carriers gamble in the Indonesian volcano area with their life and health, bearing 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijay, one of 400 miners who make a living in the extraction of sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, every day it has to go to the bottom of the crater where the sulphur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and, when in contact with the air, pass into a solid state.
After chopping up large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, it carries them on its shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2 386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes for exhausted carriers to climb up at a tortoise pace because they maintain balance and carefully rethink their steps so that they do not slip and crash into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who collapsed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur they reap.
When they're up there, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they're tired of carrying heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little bit lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Since we normally wear 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (EUR 3.8) for each trip," Anto explains to us, who usually takes three trips a day.
One journey takes him three hours and at the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138 000 rupees (EUR 11.5) per day.
Even though it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it's triple what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for the collection of coffee and the salary for 14 days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier who previously worked on Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is as convincing in Indonesia as sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risked his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on it, even though it has a face protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that are escaping from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," promises more than proper English.
This handsome and intelligent young man, with a destiny, could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, and instead he does the job of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up at 2: 00 in the morning every day because the sulfur at night does not stop coming out and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto blows into the crater and lights his way with a small lamp attached to his helmet and bought it with his own money.
About 400 carriers take out a basket of sulphur from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders.
Although the company has high revenues, it has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur due to cost savings, nor has it provided any equipment for self-employed carriers and with such efforts.
In fact, they do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) from the photography supplement, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), is chosen by the nature park watchers from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for humans," says Madrusin, a brave 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assure us that he can keep working, "as long as he can," because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although sulphur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches miners in dense fumes that come out of the volcano, miners claim that none of them complain that they suffer from severe diseases... but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and blows on their shoulders caused by the weight of baskets.
Unainic, who balances his basket on his back, can only carry 50 kilos at 53 years old.
Every day, he and his colleagues dig out 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which then take three trucks along a steep path between the bush and the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik and opens wide mouth with several teeth missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, thirty years old, he also earns by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts that carry out human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
The Singapore people are seducing that they don't have children, for careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a mint candy commercial, but yet - or perhaps that's why - the video was massively extended to YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of rap that uses local references to "put the cake in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency that created the video hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people do "their civic duty."
"This is strictly an Internet matter, so it had to be fun and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like expand perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative possible thing, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem. "
1.2 children
Anyone who doesn't take this lightly is the government of Singapore.
They spend $1,300 annually to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extending maternity leave and allocating financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last time, the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don't Singapore have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the Department of Marriage and the Family of the National Bureau of Population, says it's because of "better education" and "wider range of career opportunities."
"People thus have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, it is not just a wedding and family," explains.
These changes in social standards have helped to increase the number of free people and to delay marriages and the procreation of children, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this caused displeasure among local people.
Some of the Singapore websites show unconcealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low wages and low efforts to integrate.
Increasing immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year, Singapore's government party recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, efforts were made to tackle the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, some unexpected consequences have also occurred in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it started to affect real estate business.
The City Development Office began to regulate the number of small flats known as "shoeboxes," which can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and had a great success in the marketability.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the development company EL Developers, claims that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than bigger houses.
"They are more popular, by selling them days to weeks faster than houses with larger size.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow. "
However, it admits that the new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed out.
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the birth rate of the nation, the talk with Singapore working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore many people delay it," says the young official.
"Let the others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time, "says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Both men and women mention career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to force citizens to have children, they are still Singapore, who have the last word about starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal character or "a private life area that everyone has the right to protect against any intrusion."
What is privacy for a man under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet things that he would certainly not tell anyone during normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely own 'on a personal level and to be" username and password' when it was a social network.
"My biggest secret would not be published," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice photos or pictures of us playing on FB.
I talk to friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that made a fool of someone, "he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started a Twitter account so I could express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there, "he completes.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
He says without hesitation that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The 14-year-old Jose case is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks, and at the last network mentioned, he admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were leading him on to anything, or asking him for an address or phone number.
"If they press me or demand of me, I simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up for the Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
This boy is not an alien experience of what is now called cyberbullying.
"Known friends on social media were being blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was, "he confirms.
The victim didn't check out of the account, according to Jose.
"You just activated the private regime."
Then explains a series of steps how to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of his friends in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I'd do it if I had a problem or if I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying, "he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of the field of Education and Education, considers that children and adolescents must understand that the main aim of these networks is to inform them.
It states that: "The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that the academic staff of Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Aborigines and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people born in the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are still learning ourselves, "he says.
It explains that this is a difficult subject, "because we ask them to recognise what it is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what it is not, at an age when they are not yet mature for it."
Also, in order to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - balanced, at a time when what they most desire is to be liked, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is, asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, "Would you like someone to publish your picture the way you published your friend's picture?"
Do you know what other people publish about you?
When you label people in birthday photos, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"One follows respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet, and the same should be done on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher and an educational advisor explain that it is essential that children's parents read carefully the rules of social networks.
"If they understand every little trick, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences that Internet account can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published, "he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional 'do not talk to strangers' rule.
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Peru, ended today without a statement from Lima, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of Unasur Heads of State or Government, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Office, who at the beginning stated that the document would be published after the summit, said that it would later be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video was transmitted in the press room from the Presidential Assembly without sound with a message "confidential session, audio transmission limited."
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present at the hearing, but not by the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participating presidents, which prompted hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it is only a statement by President Humal, not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South America and the Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion the originally promised Declaration from Lima was not published, even though the press was eagerly demanded.
The official website of the ASPA can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent the flow of information.
The summit ended, inter alia, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which addresses the border dispute between the two countries.
The President of Peru Ollanta Humala and the President of Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decisions of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday by hearing both sides' defence speech to discuss the dispute that Lima initiated against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," added Piñera and greeted President Hubišek with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice's decision was published after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, thereby expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered that the decision was entirely wrong.
The summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the appeal of President Fernando Lugo at the time and did not attend the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala was appointed to open the morning speeches and close the Lima Summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects between South American countries had been planned, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR's member countries would take "important steps towards the South American citizenship objective for which residence agreements are being extended."
He has informed that actions are supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and the cheap Internet in all parts of South America, and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) is not supposed to be a victory, but is meant to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," said Humala.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between the various locations of South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better interconnected and create new economic links," said the Peruvian President in his speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two other projects concern a better connection with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, before attending a regional meeting, said that he hoped to meet with his Nicaragua counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the maritime border dispute challenged by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor is the Treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate manner possible," said Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to take part in the inauguration of the former President of Enrique Peña Nieta.
In the framework of the summit, the Union Defence Ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence issues.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the last country mentioned is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Today, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective in which "South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on national TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which the Unasur member countries supported.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
Among other things, the President of Ecuador has stated that he agrees to rearrange the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the other hand, will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Interemeric Commission on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington, "said the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, in an appeal to political asylum provided by Ecuador.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his' deep democratic values and human rights'.
He added that at that time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticised the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be interviewed in Swedish territory for alleged sexual offence, while "his own Swedish legislation allows for an interview with a videoconference call that could take place from the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he's having minor pulmonary problems, but nothing serious," said the Equador head of state.
"But there is a threat that his physical and mental condition will deteriorate, because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone's health, "he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuador Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, and stressed that talks have been held with London in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of proceedings in various European instances, "he mentioned.
He said that "if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over."
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Copenhagen Embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation of the country allows, and as has already been done in other cases, tomorrow the problem will be brought to an end. "
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and made it clear that it absolutely does not tolerate 'undermediocrity, bad intentions and a lie that undermines freedom of expression'.
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, evil and depraved politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, "he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy that neither such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemonic countries nor bourgeoisie control Ecuador," and he stated that, if re-elected, "will continue to make changes in the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership of the Unasur Union at least until its next election and argued that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and pushism wrapped up in legality" because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy."
In addition, the President of Ecuador stated that he considered the "perfectly appropriate" wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, after the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which he decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the sentence is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed widely in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward. "
He also expressed hope of settling the dispute over the maritime border that he was dealing with in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to take a judgment, however hard it may be."
In the context of the possibility of running for office in Ecuador in the next presidential election in order to apply for a third mandate, he noted that he perceived this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
"Personally, I have never been interested in power, but an unfair situation such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility, "he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term, and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, I'll have the same thing.
I've already decided, "he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says President Chávez has left for a scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the state of health of the President, "he explained.
Today, the head of the State of Ecuador took part in the Sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now a result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning had struck me," he said, in the memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "ease" a little, but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to know about it, with such commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several fights with disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigma.
At that time, neither the director of the clinic at the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) said goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
At the time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their disease and don't come until the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and unleashed the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS disease has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "means a great success that the patient's life expectancy, which starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civilian Hospital in Guadalajara, saying that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV / AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full life depends on the degree of involvement of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, better being those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that whoever is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can "live without problems up to 75 years of age while keeping treatment," explained in the interview by the doctor.
To highlight this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UN Joint Programme for HIV / AIDS - UNAIDS - UNAIDS yearbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
Only in the state of Jalisco 255 people died in 2011 and until this May 187 so far. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die of illness?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or at a late stage of the disease. "
It adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when there is already an associated infection. All we need to do to make more impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore we need to offer tests on a large scale to detect the disease to all those who ask for it."
In his proposal he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to get tests for a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he had AIDS disease and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather take three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for the better, eating healthy, practicing, taking medication. "
To this day, all his parents know is that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I look out for myself and for the other person, "Fabrizio, who has accepted the call to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO daily, to motivate those who are afraid today in World AIDS Day with his testimony.
"Let them get tested, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, and if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarises the motto of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a huge gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, stated by Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is gathering information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task, "there has actually been an increase in the distribution of condoms, we have been given one or two, and today they are giving us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Teenagers are among the most susceptible to new diseases.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school advisors, pharmacy staff and medical staff that teenagers want to avoid, says the reporter.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution be changed, that condoms are not just behind the counter, but that the hundred be found in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promiscuity support.
It's not even about "paying them beer and motel," as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute the condoms in his district.
Such sexuality is not. It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead sexual life, "he noted.
Key Numbers in the State of Jalisco
13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV cases) have been reported.
This condition means fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of diseases occur by sexual route, 6% by blood route y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people who do not know about the disease for one registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the debt restructuring of Grupo Vitro by bankruptcy in Mexico, sets a bad precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws do not seem to apply in the country of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment delivered on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale at the North Texas bankruptcy court leaves Mexican companies undefended against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the el Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens the door to the United States Supreme Court to the main Mexican glass producer, alleging three discrepancies.
First of all, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, for this purpose, a model law of the United Nations was established to unify international trade law, which determines the American Law Institute by arbitration.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of the branches of the internal corporate structure, where Vitro's debt to the branches is recognised, the majority required for approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican laws allow this possibility.
The fact is that Vitro's case was not the first one in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose internal debts the Federal Institute of bankruptcy guaranteed.
In addition, even after subtracting the branches' votes, creditors - who opposed Vitro in the United States, i.e. "vulture funds," such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have achieved a majority.
In a vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37 percent.
That indication shall not be taken into account by the appellate court.
In another way, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of the serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
In the meantime, González Sada's family company will file an appeal for a reassessment directly with the Court of Appeal in order to make an assessment with full participation, namely five judges, because they initially voted only three.
If he fails here, he will call for a review of the process by higher instances, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
It is important that the court omitted the document sent by the Mexican Government as amicus curiae, in which Vitro's practice under the Conflict Act is described in detail and it is noted that the company has facilitated itself by resorting to agreements signed by both countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
More importantly, the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the State.
Overall assessment
Unnoticed, the Mexican Aviation Trade Union's criminal announcement against the former owner of Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of cheating, was on the table for several months, and according to the pilot trade union, the vessel had already overflowed.
An indictment led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction of justice.
According to it, the Authority systematically refused to report to the Republic's Attorney General on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which IXE withdrew 198 million pesos from Fideicomis F / 589 on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The funds were probably directed at buying shares of Professional Hotel Management (Administration Professional de Hoteles).
As known, Azcárraga Andrade is a major shareholder of the Posidas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the formation of the association met at Universidad de Caribe this weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution centre with products from a "country with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a housing zone for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
In the past, Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially destroy protected areas and which is the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of ACTA
The request from the Senate, which the Government did not take into account and which asked for an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial), was no longer up-to-date.
As is known, this has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself excluded the possibility of treating it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an attempt to repay long-term debts and not to influence short-term ones, the development company Homex places investment certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
This series is the first of four identical to offer interest payment every 28 days.
Competive is born
By joining leading companies in information technology such as NYCE, e-Quálita and Kernet, a association with the trade name Competition was born, which will aim at the market for software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this theatre sport for over 60 years and has traveled the world through it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes does.
Reyes was passionate about this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a younger category player, a BSN national basketball league player, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or the president of the Puerto Rico basketball federation, before he was caught in a wheelchair stroke in 2008.
"I held a lot of roles in basketball during my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990's, General Manager of the National Team and Federation Chairman," Reyes remembered his faithful wife living in his home with him for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and commemorative items from his long career, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest movement of all guards those that resemble his work in los Vaqueros since the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to take part in eight championships with the team los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the championships in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
That's when the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader, "said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and worked at Alabama University in Birmingham, said to me," I got you a tall two-meter player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamona a victory in the championship, then Gausse will contribute to the next. "
He enjoyed the championship when he played Gausse for the team los Vaqueros, but only remotely, because he was already president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to be fully committed to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position on the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we ended up in the neighborhood, but we were supposed to have bronze without the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw, "said Reyes.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was a national team in the American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we hit the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that blew our bronze at the World Cup.
This team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivas, Fica López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
A team that may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was a team from the 1995 Olympic qualification in Neuquen, Argentina.
With players on the roster like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players voted out because of a fight at the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, we won gold.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his involvement in the different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arillo very much of the young.
Which of your successes in the Federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s, the BSN National League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What couldn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the distribution of youth categories by region.
For example, the guys from Ponce would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, referees' assistants and referees.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
The most I listen to music, watch YouTube videos of music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, world famous for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the TV series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil mogul J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the '80s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died following the official announcement of the family provided to the Associated Press by the production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he replayed the iconic role he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas with him on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest, "said Linda Gray in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman had a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series, Hagman became famous on TV as a decent guy in a light comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in the films included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. who led him to the top of the star.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing Clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The publicity slogan "Who shot Jayar?" which was supposed to create expectations about a work of emotion, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculation among viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in rate offices.
This, too, has helped to achieve a record in the audience.
The November 1980 episode in which the answer was revealed followed on average 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most watched entertainment show after the end of the show MASH in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin fired at J.R. (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorary citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on screen and off-screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second row have already been completed and the sixth one has just been shot," informed the television station.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who lit up in classic works like the South Pacific and Peter Pan musicals.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early '50s, Larry tried his luck at theatre scenes in New York and then served in the Air Force in England between 1952 and 1956.
There he met young Swedish designer Maja Axelsson, whom he married.
The married couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he published the autobiography book Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm anyone," said Prensa Asociada.
After the liver transplant, he started promoting organ donation and he was volunteering at a hospital where he helped fear patients.
"I advise them, I give courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
A course begins that examines "the end of the world."
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When Stuart Charmé's religion professor decided to take the end-of-the-world course this semester, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: the end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar to come on December 21, many people caught on as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was ahead of him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call the "debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict in which Israel is being dragged into, the place in which, according to Christians theorizing the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," said Charmé to the students of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When you talk about what's going on in the world today, like we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for apocalyptic thinkers.
And that's not the only professor who's offering "end-of-the-world" courses this semester, which is theoretically the last one in history.
At Temple University, Barry Vacker's assistant organizes a "Resources, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are discussing why these ideas are spreading over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material reaches the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students are analyzing movies with apocalyptic themes and exploring how they differ from real life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the University of the State of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a technical assistant to the history of art and anthropology, gathered to organize a course called the End of the World.
"We do not connect" 2012, "because we always count on the possibility of organizing the course again if the world does not end," said Restall.
Despite "imminent destruction," students have to study, create projects and do final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the evening of the anticipated end of the world," said Restall.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He spread out in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-grade students who logged in 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we were asked by e-mail whether there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And therefore, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessional student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the end of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan predictions and we disprove it in a way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back several centuries, which people react to changes in their surroundings by predictions of the end of the world.
The blooming of these speculations was caused by the Internet.
"Somewhere else people don't think about it," he said.
It happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, answered the question as to whether he knew about a course on "the end of the world," quickly.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception at the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Resall noted that over the years there have been talk of many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period at which the world will end.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Several said they intend to go to the end-of-the-world festival.
"I think I'll call some friends to laugh together," explained Samira Ford's 20-year-old communication student.
