In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During the call to the distress line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and needed them to come to their home.
Lamb decided that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset, and that contacts with the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry, and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," said the letter that the authorities signed Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to a school campus where the police believe he shot Professor Ethan Schmidt's favorite at the door of his office.
Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said that the university staff heard shots fired at 10: 18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
In the end another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting, it forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities in charge are still trying to figure out what Lambo's motivation was.
The details published by investigators on the state side, as well as the students and employees who knew him, together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police at Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included Lambo in the book he wrote, to thank the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with 17 other faculty members and many students took courses at the same time.
At the same time, there have been inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for medical reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that a doctorate, which Lamb worked hard on, would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
The president of William LaForge University said that he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was probably bothering Mr. Lamb."
Lamb won't answer those questions anymore.
After he left campus, the police picked up his trail crossing the state line of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot wound from a gun in the backyard about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car running on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began to work at the University, which has 3500 students in the city, comprising about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
In the spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamba's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and witty man.
Carla hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was this great older guy who'd been tutoring her guitar for years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The heart of all the girls was discovered as soon as it appeared, "says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposedly dating for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house that adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail graduated from the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a sparsely lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lambo and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, sweat that Lamb had finished playing guitar and harmonica for a countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We were flirting and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a first-year seminar and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boy's student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students and community members, took part in a candlelight event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and Jeff Schnidt's brother also attended the vigil during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this story.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
The Toys R Us claim not to recruit as many seasonal workers as last year, but the toy and product manufacturers claim to give current and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, which is a decline compared to 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month and will recruit employees during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is coming up and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help out in shops and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his' date 'with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was remarkable even for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in time."
The movie's starting, and I realize I'm within reach of something called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which presents interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and also director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is certainly the best travel document that has ever been filmed for me."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
The UN chief says there's no military solution in Syria.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
Once again, the UN President urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly ministerial meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unworkable."
Ban called for five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching Iran's nuclear deal in the resolution of the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others waved over their hands like a failed joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whatever Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (so far).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a double digit number, and some people are seriously asking what that means for the nomination chances of this property tycoon.
Of course, it is still the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made a path to Herman Cain's rise, and in the end, none of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into you in the general election.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeb Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to hold on and start unloading their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real estate mogul is not just a fleeting phase:
Trump's approval rating turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the vote of Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick in the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "outraged" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "excited" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush's favorite were to become a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his pompous and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationwide inclined to think that a real estate mogul has the right temper for the presidency, according to Monday's ABC News / Washington Post vote.
The same number is held in the Iowa State Senate Club, which is the first in the entire country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn't have a personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independent says that his temper doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN / ORC survey last week.
This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
This time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as their candidate against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that a fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Mark Rubius by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would have led a dealer with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-against-one game.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters claim they've already made their point.
The new CBS / NYT Tuesday survey shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump claim that they will not change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for a change between candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in the announcement speech of his campaign, immigration continues to hold on as the main and central topic of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump's pompous will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage to the rebranding effort.
But according to a new Monday's ABC / Post opinion poll, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as the subject of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The frustration of the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now receiving about half the support from Republican voters, especially given their outsider status.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC / Post vote on Monday say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "infernal angry."
The House supported a larger share of the State's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the income from the extraction of brown coal from the mining company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that this would give them extra money from both the Treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
Members of the opposition who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they have been, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget. At first reading, the House supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which means, among other things, that the State should receive more of the income from the mining of brown coal from the mining company.
The share of the State will increase to 67%, while the share of the municipalities will decrease from 75% to 33% so far.
The forecast also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for minerals that companies benefit from.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
According to the Government, the revenue of municipalities' budgets is expected to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received around CZK 450 million of fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal led to the municipalities about CZK 200 million and the state of CZK 66 million.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration from the quarrying areas, with the permitted production of CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments is to continue to belong to municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that, thanks to this, the municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to 100 million per year instead of CZK 14 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be laid down by law, but it will be laid down by the government by its decree.
The remuneration shall be recalculated as the product of the quantity of mineral extracted and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the Government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, MEP Marek Benda warned against the fact that the imposition of a charge by the Government may not comply with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, this is not a matter of tax in this case, because the State charges the mineral, which is state property.
Charges shall be paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and one-quarter of the state will be given.
The same ratio will be used for the production of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the State will collect from the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide the mining rescue service.
Opposition Members criticised the proposal, who argued in particular that it would damage the communities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Kucera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they did before, as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Dawn), elected in the Ústí Region.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, Ms KSČM warned Hana Aulická.
Kadner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90% negotiated over the long term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not experience price increases.
"On the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by seeking to reduce their operating expenditure, which would, above all, mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
According to it, however, the increase in the employment fees is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment of Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits on coal mining before the law is passed.
If coal is to be exploited beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak army's mine should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for reasons of social, nation-economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
The Merry will lead the Czechs as a leader, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear during Thursday's drawing of the Davis Cup in India on the board, and this time each of them will probably intervene in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navre plans to break down the load on the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
There is hot and high humidity in Delhi, which is why there are demanding matches that can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out by the weather.
And according to how it will look, he said he returned during today's Czech selection training in the center of Raz Kumár Khanna.
With a team number one and a world-class 40, Jiří Veselých counts on Friday and Sunday's doubles.
Luke Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to spin in position 2.
I'd like almost everyone to be involved.
I've got it in my head slowly, but I'm not going to say it yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be Stephen's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who will stand next to an experienced dumbass player who has an 18-to-4 balance sheet in Davis' four-game cup.
I don't think it's gonna be happy.
There are options left with Rosol or Adam Pavlaska.
"I really don't know who and what it will look like," he said.
It will be decided according to the development of the two games.
The variant can be Pavlásek, with Veselé surprised in the first round by winning a debacle over the Australians.
"He's a decent guy," he said.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to do the same performance I showed from the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlasek.
The landlord puts Yuki Bhambria in two games (125th in ATP ranking), which won last week's Challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the third and fourth hundred players.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
They're both Challenger players and ours have ATP Tour experience, but many times we've made sure that the leaderboards in the Davis Cup don't make decisions.
"The current form, the weather, decides," he said.
Friday's opening doubles will begin at 6: 30 P.M. and can stretch because of the weather.
The forecast says it's going to rain, and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting if necessary.
They've already lit it, and it's got some 2,000 luxuries, which is enough.
"It should be possible to play under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQ has been very enthusiastically awaited.
Jeremy Corbyn's new work manager will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time, he will work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he demanded "less theater and more facts."
He also said that he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which, after his appointment, comes to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC Annual Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to become silent during the singing of the national anthem on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle on Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and is the focus of several stories on the front pages of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said that he would "stand in awe of silence" and that he would acknowledge "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle for Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend a Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in the economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "held" after Mr Corbyn's appointment despite his position in the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow labour and pensions, said that the party 'very clearly' opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party to whom David Cameron has faced over the last decade since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Workers' Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas' from the crowd 'for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain from both "quick answers," and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not participate - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he was told that he had discussed the matter with the House spokesman John Bercowe.
When Mr Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their attitude among the other MPs, despite the criticism that they have become caricatures and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photography in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising while wage growth in the UK is accelerating
Libra jumped on the following dates and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was conducted above by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it looked like estimates of when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped 20% after getting a bid from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and the approach to brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The shares of Burberry were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the rival group of luxury goods Richemont.
Richelmont's latest sales results are beyond expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
The shares in Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said they increased by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest drop on the index and dropped 4.3% after Goldman Sachs downgraded his rating to the company for "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jump in mid-year profits before tax £46.6m
The head of JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion.
The Executive President of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs at his company, he states.
The costs could be affected by plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment house are cheering the marshmallows.
The controversial building got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
There were hundreds of people protesting in front of the Prague office, and petitions were also created against the construction to be built in close proximity to the Anezka monastery in the centre of Prague.
The Magistrate stated in the decision that there had been a breach of the building law because not all the elements of the zoning decision had been respected.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, distances from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clearly and clearly described the shape of the building, the definition of the area affected by the construction," the decision states.
It also considers that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the documentation initially discussed, but that it has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file that, however, the owner of the land has only supported the agreement of the project documentation for territorial management, not the agreement of the location of the building on his land, writes in the Department of Construction Regulations.
According to Francesco August Razett of the Investor Company, the Department of Construction did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review had expired.
Anyway, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, respecting all laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," said Razetto in the press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow because of the allegedly proposed colour of the facade, is causing strong emotions in Prague.
In the heart of the city, hundreds of people have gathered to protest the construction.
The congregations and residents of nearby homes are concerned that some of the permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the imsuitability of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anezka monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
According to the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (SAO), the Ministry of Culture rejected the original design of the project from 2008, which included a glazed façade, and cancelled the permission of the Prague Monuments in 2010.
The new Praga Progetti e Investimenti project with face-shaped windows was approved by the NPÚ and the municipal monuments and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the complaints of the opponents, said he never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after the pink and white confectionery.
The Czech politician gave migrants a ride.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, which they said they wanted to carry for about a half a kilometer.
At the time, he said it wasn't criminal in Hungary, he said to the People's papers.
We knew that law enforcement didn't affect that kind of behavior.
But when the cops pulled us over, to our surprise, we were arrested and transferred to a custody investigation in Szeged, he described a sheet.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police were said to be correct, but communication was stalled, because they did not speak English very well.
The prison, however, was, in his opinion, a trifle.
For example, in our cell, about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were in distress.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going on with them, Berg said.
What can't be confiscated anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. she will answer questions from readers from 9: 30 to the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavla Fucíková.
You can ask her about changes to the Enforcement Act valid from 1 September 2015 and about other matters related to executions or executors.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the country to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from the Aldi attack in southern and western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the country to fight the Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand using marketing in mainstream and social media and events like Adelaide shows.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as Dunsborough based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tasting in IGA stores and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake, because South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA business moves and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will make five percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first business that has taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, in his report by analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, he estimated that IGA retail would lose USD 360 million on annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in South Australia and 30 in the west during the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and USD 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost him around USD 13 million in pre-tax revenues, confirmed by Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly towards Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan's latest survey found that buyers at IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglass fund, the founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear over a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and the earnings from Metcash food trade, which supplies around 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation, as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale has switched to counter-attack and are investing more than USD 150 million a year to match counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week to help IGA retailers reequip business by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
The Executive Director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the pricing and retrofitting programmes will catch momentum and hope that the wholesale sale will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a collateral loss in the recent uproar around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," has drawn unwelcome attention to himself through an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka on the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then said, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios and I should have hit him too."
While he was last seen smashing the rocket after the cramp had destroyed Richard Gasquet's possible defences to the US Open, Kokkinakis was relentlessly defending Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a second double position behind Bernard Romic in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against Britain.
"I have been thinking quite intensively about the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a little drawn into the whole dispute," says Healy.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost to a cramp in the US, but he's not the first player to take his anger out on his rocket because of frustration, and I know Thanasi pretty well, and I can tell he won't be proud of this event.
But he really handled himself very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits in great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in amazing condition, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios because of an important struggle that starts on Friday, and states that "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the native of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term stability.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not all the controversy that [Kyrgios] created around it," says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, he's growing rapidly in the eyes of the public, he's also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, when he can think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and for himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency status, closing borders and holding migrants
Following the announcement of the threat situation, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in the land of no one, and Serbian authorities reacted outraged.
Those who are stuck on the country's belt between two states for an unknown time are those who are fleeing violence in their native countries, building tents and settling in.
But here comes the feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, migrants call out together "Open the border!" and curse the Hungarian police unit.
Some reject food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister claims that it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of a solution, not just an indirect injury.
In the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The riots on the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-state block did not come up with a unified immigration policy at the ongoing meeting in Brussels.
Ministers have agreed to share responsibility for 40 000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and have spoken with hope of reaching a possible agreement for another month or at the end of the year that the EU nations would accept more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special EU European summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not press ahead with its hopes for Brussels or its neighbours.
The constitutional state of threat in the two southern regions gave authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up judicial cases of asylum negotiations.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped draw barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point for the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go after a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the violation of a four-metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison periods for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government is announcing a state of emergency," Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesperson for the government, told the reporters in Szeged, South.
We are very clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, Parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army that was expected next week, but reporters of the Associated Press at the border have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgs Bakondi, the Home Defense Adviser Orban, said that the authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 caught already in state territory.
They have penetrated through the breach of the fence, and are now in police custody charged with committing offences under new laws.
Authorities had the fence fixed quickly.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed wire towed vehicle.
At the main border crossing at Roszke there was chaos because the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and the pressure of people was created.
About 20 of them fit inside, but thousands remain outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's jump in front of Bernie Sanders has been halved in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-figure lead in the Democratic nomination race at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of democratic primary voters (58 percent down), while Sanders is second in line with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is to announce whether he wants to become President, is getting support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that there are clearly decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground with several demographic groups, while Sanders has acquired several.
Clinton keeps a big head start between women and alleviates, but her leadership is narrowing.
Its support among men has fallen significantly and Sanders has lost only 5 points on it.
The advantage of Clinton with democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and now she and Sanders are equal.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is only losing 5 points on her in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters across the country say that she would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would only support it for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I don't suppose it's surprising that the current clinton supporters are particularly passionate about her.
The views are mixed between those that do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in the open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it is time for her to be president of a woman (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, there is a great deal of choice and agreement on the problems.
While the vice president is considering potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of democratic primary voters would like to see him do it - a third of them think he shouldn't run.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party nomination, Biden is the most common choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, she listed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs for 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; but this number fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is a far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be electable is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the candidate's greater importance, democratic voters prefer problem-solving to a greater chance of election.
Like last month, not one democratic candidate or potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that opinion on him.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are consistent with their ideological views.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As the questions concerning Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as State Secretary continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their overall view of her at all.
But it's a whole different story among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were already divided in March, shortly after the problem became apparent.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while at 36 percent, their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Despite the fact that Clinton is perceived as honest and credible among its party voters, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as honest and credible, which is a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush did best in honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't make an opinion about him.
The error margin in sample 351 of primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up with Donald Trump in the national election.
Ben Carson approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest poll, and others are getting support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a overwhelming majority, and climbed 23% of the support in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey has also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and is taking out Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is lagging behind with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker completely on the stand with 10% support, fell to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The error margin for the 376 Republican voters sample in the latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was held in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey published last week showed that Carson had improved and reached 19% of the support among the Republicans behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest survey from ABC News / Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to take a blind shot at a retired neurosurgeon and even apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five fraternity members charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during a burdensome brotherly ritual at the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge against five people was filed.
Members of the Brotherhood of New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, announced the police.
The police said he was blindfolded, he was wearing a bag full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds, and he was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 right after Deng passed out, and apparently they waited an hour for him to be taken to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the Brotherhood, and ask for his advice, said Police Chief Chris Vagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide equipment and essentially preferred the well-being of brotherhood to Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of brotherhood overbursts and at least one student dies every year because of overbursts since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible, and this is an important step for the institutions.
The grand jury of Monroe County has recommended a murder charge in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault by overage and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organisation that approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will also hold them accountable," said Wagner at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College has banned brotherhood and national brotherhood has abolished its relationship with local branches.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates.
Rates will rise, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna take.
For the economy, the history of a small producer offers timing.
Recession came 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets react.
This is why US central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rates will start to rise, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalisation will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss over speed increases can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'cheap money'," said Julian Jessop, the leading global economist, Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to a more common but still low one to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last about a month, the expected rise in rates can make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for the reintroduction of shares 12-24 months after the first increase, which may once again reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank's analysts reported in a recent study on what will happen after the increase in the Fed.
More precisely, the market over the last 35 years often most - about 14 percent - is heading towards a rise in rates in relatively flat 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dolla, the main stock strategist of the company Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the tariff cycle, and the return is beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but raising rates often helps it.
At present, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could hasten the recession.
Most remarkable is that gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history when raising Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate increases since 1950, only two nominal annual GDP increases were below 4.5%.
Despite the fact that it was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few would expect it to be maintained when it was only 1.5% in the third quarter, reported by the Atlanta Fed.
Increasing rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise as to "whether this period is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were prepared to grow the Fed all year long and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the growth cycles have been in the super-cycle of increasing leverage with GDP, covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," says the report.
On the contrary, this has clearly been a slow recovery since the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest one that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still going on.
The fixed return was also volatile, because the market is expecting a rise in rates, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more rapid on bonds than on shares when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase / decrease cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle, bond yields fall immediately, "said Deutsche.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in rates will bring yields closer between long- and short-dated bonds, which will balance the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we are still careful about yield tensioning," said Kathy Jones, a firm analyst for Schwab's fixed income.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the Fed's expectations of politics.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have spread, and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens politics.
Generally speaking, firms that do most of their business in the US will win interest rates after the rise and local products will become more attractive.
Transnational companies with a lot of debt will do worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market area, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that" quality "of shares tends to overcome itself within three months of the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachsve analysts in the client report.
On average, companies with strong balance sheets outnumber weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital, as well as low-volatility stocks, also surpassed their counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) on average.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates lose the most, said Goldman.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers also benefit from a rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member Andrew Bingham
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "robbing."
He thinks he's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial opponent.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, and he says they're just cheating on the British.
A fellow Member Damien Collins attacked Voice and says even he is not the original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, claiming a leading MEP and accumulating fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove that they are doing something commercial that they are not doing.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public service radio station appears to be "bogged down" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business opponent.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word" stuffy "- but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The BBC CEO rejected the charges on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I wouldn't learn what I learned about classical music on Radio 3 on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and making music is, in fact, top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire because of stepping on the heels of business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sports and reached the hearing committee.
Conservative MEP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million prize.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as a judge - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" next time it started a fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending money on royalties for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have been growing at the slowest rate since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth rate has been observed since the records themselves began in 2000.
Internet sales were reinforced three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could be the reason for the spending braking.
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making many of Britain's main streets a ghost town.
However, experts claim that there are signs of stable online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August was the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of 2000, with an increase of only 5% compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of stable online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth level over the past years and go back to 2000, the state has always rationalised over time," says the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, the IMRG sales index editor.
It explains that internet sales were reinforced three years ago, when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to be fading.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from buying before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
In the last year, five times the average of buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and to drop several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers negotiate again, can keep customers away from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was spent online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of the sales are made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
The Muslims buried the victims of the crash of the crane in Mecca, and the Bin Laden family was sanctioned.
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets of Muslims in the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blames for the collapse of construction tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crash of the crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the mourners chose a path and paid their respects to the victims when the first of the fallen got on their last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell to the believers.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned a construction group of the bin Laden family over a disaster that was also abandoned by 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the crash of the crane at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the opening of the annual Haj pilgrimage.
The Saudi officials have already promised that a snake will take place in Mecca, and thousands of people will continue to descend into the city.
King Salman stated today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane's shoulder up when it was out of service.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by a state-run Saudi press agency, states that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the fall.
The English Disk Agency did not report this detail, but stated that the company's bosses were banned from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are cowering before the Haj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not issued any statement of crane collapse and have not been made available to its representatives for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and the lack of coordination with weather officials.
Tens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
The Bindain family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and run major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade who was renounced by the family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in the midst of a strong wind and rain just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that must be attended at least once in his life by every successful Muslim.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be dedicated to relatives killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half this amount.
Chief B & Q says Eastern European traders working for cheap trends
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronica Laura
The number of traders taught in Eastern Europe is beyond growth
The result is an open 200 Screwfix business focused on traders
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q outlets across the country
Worked by Rupert Steiner, the chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
They say that the British put down their hammers and brushes and pass them on to the employed taught by Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with a hammer or a paint brush, it looks like you're in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do the Kutil work at their home, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B & Q.
Veronica Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for domestic needs, claims that a large increase in the number of Eastern European traders offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores focused on traders, and closes 60 B & Q outlets.
Mrs Laura claims that she wants to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
At present, the majority of male workers are male.
She said that there is a need to address growing demographic trends, which depict more female households, which make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "Men work in our stores all the time.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% decisions about the purchase of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between directors men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including executive and financial directors.
Mrs Laura says: 'It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher announced a fall in both profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing the shops.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B & Q, is to open 200 new shops
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of the flat stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
The President of the ODS Zbynek Stanjura noted that a one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long term it would be better to be in standard indexation, as it would be reflected in the years to come.
"We have room to find the mechanism to do this," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), according to which next year was to be voiced beyond the law.
Marks defended the grant by arguing that she would improve the social situation of pensioners who, in her opinion, are not pink.
The higher indexation next year would mean a budget impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of indexation has been reduced.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opalka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
Veto's right will make the payout much more complicated in December and perhaps even impossible, he said.
The Chairman of the ČSSD Roman Glass therefore proposed a shortening of the deadline for the discussion of the standard in committee to 10 or 20 days, even the right has blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should come out at a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should increase by about 100% on average.
The pension allowance should be paid according to the pension amendment by people who will be entitled to the pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to ask for a supplement in writing, not later than the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued by January, namely the rise in prices and a third of the increase in real wages.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wage, and next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year, according to the state's closing account.
Expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26% of all budget expenditure and 46% of all statutory expenditure.
The average full retirement pension last year increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10.714 according to the state's closing account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided a payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17.000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned his plans for a political career, he's going to pursue science.
The Senate seat was almost certain of the billionaire according to the Russian media.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as the candidate for the United Russia Government Party, defended his post with clarity in the Sunday elections.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from three candidates whose names are announced before the governor's election.
After the election, he will select the senator from the three candidates himself.
The complication was for Jakunin that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by the law.
While the Kremlin found an exception for Jakunin, it is an exceptional and authorised ambassador not covered by the legal long-term residence requirement.
The Czech comedy Tiger Theory is over.
The last straw in the main hero's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who ran out of strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janzurová decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
John knows he's on a similar path with his wife Olga, Elisa Balzer.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom again.
He desires to regain control of his life - and, as a solution, he chose to escape from it so far, introduced Nightingale to the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedy form a kind of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role was to Bartoshka, who he had already worked with on Invisible.
Yet the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a cocooned athlete.
He used to ask where he would sit before shooting another scene.
This time he rode a bike, climbed rocks and even went up a hill.
And all in record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, women marry a tiger to turn him into a rabbit over time.
They're gonna feed him a little bit, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't think of playing outside the tiger rabbit shop.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie about, an actor commented on it.
His wife, who may seem slightly negative to the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathic, and she means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurper, and she wants to caress her husband to death, and he pointed out Bajgar.
The film also depicts the fate of John's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Táňa Vilhelmo and Pavla Beretová - and son-in-law Erika and Pepik - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US Internet company Google promised to provide up to $5.5 million (CZK 132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday, Google.org, which is a charitable branch of this internet company.
Azerbaijan has cancelled the part of Telicko's visit for criticizing human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the YES movement Pavel Telicka has postponed Thursday's trip to Baku because the Azerbaijan authorities cancelled his official visit today.
According to Telicka, Baku is justified by the resolution of the EP last week, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telicka was co-author of.
By decision of the Azerbaijan Party Telicka lost the opportunity to talk to the official partners and also to visit political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, the Brussels office explained in the press release.
Telička wanted to use the route planned several months in advance to meet with Parliament's leadership and executive representatives as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, specified the text sent by ČTK.
The EP resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan."
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment on Azerbaijan's opposition journalist Chadija Ismail, who advocated the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out the fact that it will build its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the future creation of a Russian air base in Syria when visiting Novosibirsk.
We don't have such plans yet.
But nothing is impossible, he said.
Russia already has an age-old naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which it has used so far more as a service and logistics centre.
But, according to reports from the Russian press, the supply of Russian equipment and military equipment to Syria has risen since early August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from current trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to set up an air base outside Latakiya, which for now remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria; American commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov; it was already their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will head to Moscow to convey concerns about the gathering of Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the support of Assad from Moscow a lost bet.
He said that Russia's policy objectives in Syria are rather unclear.
In his opinion, Moscow has turned Syria into its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculation by the Russian press, is supposed to be Putin's speech at the forthcoming meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York.
On the contrary, Russia's leader is not going to talk about the situation in Donbas, Ukraine.
According to today's New York Times report, the US government does not rule out President Barack Obama meeting with the Russian President during the UN meeting.
But the views between White House advisors are said to be falling apart so far.
TASS today, referring to the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York stay.
Sesame oil on the bile diet, cannabis helps strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from cold seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common reason for the death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are one of the fans of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It's often used on a gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids that it contains are a good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% cause of bile inflammation and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, the problems with the gallbladder mainly concern overweight people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be successfully used in a liver diet that is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits brought by the consumption of this oil, they should be careful about the goods from exotic food stores.
Asian producers often use over-roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more distinctive taste.
However, the oil will lose all active substances, described by Ladislav Hachecký, CEO of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces organic virgin cold-pressed oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press will be able to press eight kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for extra virgin marking.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil benefits from heart and blood vessels disease.
The Czech favorite among the oils is sunflower.
The research by Jarmila Hamerskaya, which led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents preferred it in the warm kitchen.
In fact, it is not suitable for frying, it is already starting to overburn at 180 ° C.
It is better to use it, for example, for the seasoning of salads and is particularly suitable in a diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most reduce cholesterol levels from all fatty acids.
In case of heart problems, care should be taken to ensure the amount of total fat and calories received.
For example, there are 62 calories in one tablespoon of sunflower oil, 99 calories in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to note that natural foods with nutritious substances are much more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrial products.
It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last the same as sesame and hemp for nine months.
Storage in the fridge will extend the shelf life.
Old oil is known especially by bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no cataract at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Cannabis oil contains the most healthy acids.
Industrial hemp seeds are among the so-called superfoods and therefore cannabis oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids, the body can't make itself, and one has to take them out of food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while the Icelandic accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Cannabis oil should be included in the diet as part of a support diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using cannabis oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that in Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling.
It sells 500 grand a year.
People often take one spoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Cannabis oil is not delicious, but it will strengthen immunity perfectly, Daniel Vlček from the Kraslický firm Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecues are Americans.
There's 1.4 barbecues per household.
All over the world, there are various barbecues that only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have never grilled in their lives.
The vast majority then barbecues several times a year.
To make the barbecue successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating it several hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this and at the same time leaves healthy ingredients during the barbecue?
As a general rule, fat should be avoided during the grilling process itself.
Experts agree that a large proportion of oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also lose the body of a beneficial substance, which we otherwise gain from it when consuming oils from dishes modified at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oils won't find their way through the barbecue.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, the experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in Sokolovsk immediately equip themselves with grape oil.
It is a wonderful addition to the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen features a unique characteristic of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling as it has a high level of combustion, up to 216 ° C.
Even at this high temperature, as one of the few oils retains healthy substances, Daniel Vlček describes the benefits of grape oil from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this wine oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and broken hair.
The chefs commend the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example for the seasoning of salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
The barbecue can therefore be used in two ways, the marinating and the barbecue itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we will preserve their succulence.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
We deliver acidity with apple vinegar, for example, and thus achieve softening of meat.
The spice again gives the meat taste and the oil preserved and gives the right sting, says Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can penetrate through dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are therefore ready to barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oil is characterized by only a few drops to prepare the dishes.
Same goes for the barbecue.
Some oils are completely taboo for this way of preparing.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Wipe the grate with oil before the grilling itself, thus preventing the burning of food.
The preparation of annexes is also a necessary part of the barbecue.
With grilled meat and fish, practically anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
The chefs of Bohemia Oil recommend for example a hot summer salad.
You need: • 1 piece of peach • 1 piece of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add shredded arugula, diced cucumbers and cut peach on large cubes to the salad bowl.
Depending on the taste of salt and pepper, you can also taste ground chili and soy sauce.
In conclusion, cover with a few drops of grape oil.
For exceptional taste, you can then sprinkle the salad with finely cut almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just the drugs that matter, it's the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation, if they choose to have a child, care for these patients includes social law advice, recommendations for housing arrangements, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can affect the patient itself in a fundamental way.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As the doctors point out, the passivity of the patients makes room for disease activity.
For example, it is shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when a sick person needs a compensatory device, such as a stick.
The important thing is that patients and their surroundings are not subject to different myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is also why a page was created. Take a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign. Take a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, there is twice the saying that the sooner the disease begins to heal, the more likely the doctor can influence something.
It's because we have multiple sclerosis drugs at an inflammatory stage where the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and delay disability, explains MUDr. Eva Med from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves weakening of lower limbs or imbalance of balance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, to improve walking, to strengthen the pelvic floor, to reduce swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It is really individual, depending on the particular patient's difficulties," says MUDr. Martin Kövári, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic, Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
Movement activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive thing about regular exercise is the fact that sick people check out what they can do, and that makes them more confident.
"Endorphins are also washed away during the exercise and one feels good about it," says PhDr. Kamila Rásová of the Rehabilitation Clinic of the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we are acting on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, supplies.
"In the past, these patients were so-called" saved, "we now know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic, Faculty Hospital in Motola.
Physiotherapy is intended so that one can remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including job placement.
Physiotherapists therefore collaborate with ergotherapists so that each person gets a compensatory device tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a tough life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people get shaken up.
They're going through shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own.
"I work with them so that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with the handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert of the Neurological Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses wouldn't fly.
Air production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new planes are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that some people just can't make and process.
Yet, in addition to super-precision, computer-controlled machine tools, it is possible to bump into something as common as apricot stones in addition to auto-key formulations.
In a drum that resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are rolled in a pile of stones.
"So far, no one has found anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of Latecoere Czech Republic.
In an area in Prague Letňany, the former Letov produces a complete door for Airbus A320.
They're the only ones in the world who supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Passengers also enter the first and upper classes on the top decks of the largest airbus aircraft in the world of Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company has the torque keys adjusted twice a year.
If there was a record of a check missing from the yellow sticker, they would have something to explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing in Prague, who regularly go to see if the doors are made according to the agreed rules.
Human senses have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1,500 rivets on one door to A320.
The rivets need to be handcuffed.
It takes them two days.
Even from the sound of the hammer falling, they can tell if the rivet is already properly shaken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The wash can rise from zero to 0.13 millimetres above the surface of the aircraft.
That's about twice the thickness of human hair.
It's time for the checkup to get a trained touch.
If the controller runs his finger over a row of rivets, he'll know if any of them are out of tolerance.
Then he takes the exact perv-meter into his hand.
Before 1989, Letov had been feeding off the L-39 training aircraft program.
But in 1991, none of them were made.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
That's when she got together with the European Airbus aircraft manufacturer.
She won a tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321 model.
The courtship with Boeing wasn't so happy.
"We were a small company to them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable supplies," says Dubský.
The door to the US manufacturer would have remained locked if Letov had not taken the French Latecoere group to the Prague conference in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
A meeting with the French took place the next day, says Dubský.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with strong company came new orders.
Right in 2000, the assembly of parts of the door for A320 started.
Three years later, the upper deck door was added to the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten ourselves into these big jobs.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
Partners want delivery guarantees for 20 or 30 years, explains Dubský.
Last year, Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of more than 2.9 billion and profits after tax of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position between suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification 170 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't have made any aircraft doors.
Get certificates that production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated checks they are worth according to Dubské millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more precise and more stringent.
We need to train the staff, retrofit the equipment and re-certify the process, adds Dubský.
Now the company is finishing the process for plating zinc and nickel, which will replace the existing harmful cadmium for human health.
They got the input from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the devices or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people of Boeing are coming to check out the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, bringing the Dubský way of controlling them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for Prague's company.
With the Prague race today stands and falls the production of embraers.
For A320 it produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer.
But it doesn't mean he can say any price behind the door.
A price curve is part of the contract.
It indicates how much one door will cost after 10, 50, 100 pieces.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we'll lose, says Dubsky.
Half the hall where the electric cabinets are assembled for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft is empty so far.
But it is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic line for riveting and mounting doors for the innovative A320 Neo is being built behind the screen.
The riveting will accelerate and refine.
"This is the trend with which the installation takes place in aviation," adds Dubský.
The sale has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that the airlines have hitherto ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Just a few meters away, a line will be created for the complete assembly of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests for fitting some electrical and electronic equipment into the doors for the largest Airbus.
The company also bets on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new A350 Airbus program, which will compete with American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," says Dubský proudly.
However, Latecoere is on the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place in the Letov area where they're based.
Before the French mother joined, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's got 800, and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new aircraft they order each year, they don't have to worry about work.
Although he has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of the Prague Latecoere faced a threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay off their loans in September.
In the end, Latecoere managed to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she traded them some of the loans for shares.
The creditors received a share of 37.4% in the company by raising EUR 57.4 million.
Company debt fell by two thirds, i.e. EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company signed new shares among existing shareholders for EUR 222.9 million.
In total, it raised the capital by EUR 280 million.
The whole group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85% of the sales.
The average increase in orders is expected by four percent per year until 2017.
In the order book, it has orders for EUR 2.6 billion, which corresponds to four years' production.
The French media say that Latecoere can finally take another breath after years of dripping.
The Czech race in Prague Letňany is important for groups.
16% contribute to the Group's sales.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The Members supported a larger share of the State's coal fees.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
According to the Government, the revenue of municipalities' budgets is expected to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received around CZK 450 million of fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal led to the municipalities about CZK 200 million and the state of CZK 66 million.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration from the quarrying areas, with the permitted production of a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments is to continue to belong to municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that, thanks to this, the municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to 100 million per year instead of CZK 14 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be laid down by law, but it will be laid down by the government by its decree.
The remuneration shall be recalculated as the product of the quantity of mineral extracted and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the Government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, MEP Marek Benda warned against the fact that the imposition of a charge by the Government may not comply with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, this is not a matter of tax in this case, because the State charges the mineral, which is state property.
Charges shall be paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and one-quarter of the state will be given.
The same ratio will be used for the production of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the State will collect from the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide the mining rescue service.
Today, opposition Members have criticised the proposal, who have argued in particular that it will damage the communities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Kucera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they did before, as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Dawn), elected in the Ústí Region.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, Ms KSČM warned Hana Aulická.
Kadner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90% negotiated over the long term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not experience price increases.
"On the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by seeking to reduce their operating expenditure, which would, above all, mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
According to it, however, the increase in the employment fees is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment of Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits on coal mining before the law is passed.
If coal is to be exploited beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak army's mine should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for reasons of social, nation-economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching as the US Federal Reserve is about to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists addressed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain dormant for some time and keep interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it has passed years since the Fed reduced rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates, "says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy has done fairly well, a recovery has taken place in the form of adding trillion dollars to the government account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for an increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see great odds against this move.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20: 00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day his colleague - wrote a note saying that he was "sorry" for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, revealed the government on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi said that Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10: 00 a.m.
and he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a "cute dog" in the house that "won't bother anyone," but he's upset.
The police requested the caller's name, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why there was a shooting in the house.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lambo saying, "I'm so sorry, and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me. "
After leaving a note, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
The Dean of the University William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "something was clearly going on in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, the government authorities stated that there was no "evidence" about the "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shaken up" the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, as Sun Herald said, Prentiss was working from a house on the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb talked to his relatives on Monday and said he wasn't going to jail.
When the cops caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran off into the woods where he shot himself.
According to his CV, which he published on the school's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their magic
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his longstanding partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
I'm sure all these things take their toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a couple of months for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the League of Masters against the PSF Eindhoven.
While this left defenseman left this wound in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moreno's reckless intervention in the 15th minute that 20-year-old Shaw burst into the PSV area.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes, and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture, and now he's in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow, or perhaps the day after, and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 has a very hard time, but he plays fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask, too.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group phase.
I believe he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeat against PSF
The English defender will have an added incentive to recover in the form of the European championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with this kind of injury, everyone gets very sad about it.
It's never the aim of our players to hurt our opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture during the Mexico game against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It is very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it is not good," said Coca.
I haven't been able to see this moment.
All I saw was a ball heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about this, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smallling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long to learn it almost by heart.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
At the request of a children's schematic provider to name a favorite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax chose a 1971 fable from Dr Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on SuperCamps' website and goes on: "Funny, moving, creative and with strong content, which I liked to read to my children, because behind it was always a picture or message that I had never seen before."
Well, except in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book according to an elevator from the 2012 movie, which added other characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is the brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it were not suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron is read as a summary lift of the movie Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words, "In Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would become acquainted with the story of a book where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being destroyed by a greedy, tree-cutting industrialist once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a crouched, moustled creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively minor PR assignment was given to an assistant who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for Downing Street said that the text probably came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of omission of England, but he still holds
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team England has chosen for this tour, I think the replay of the 3-0 defeat suffered in the last trial series will be unlikely.
I wouldn't rule out a win-win either.
The Alastair Cook party may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting lineup, and the collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the trial series, represents the offensive possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests opposed two good attacks in difficult conditions and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are judged by performance.
For example, there were no question marks around Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because - and I have already mentioned this before - players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century, and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not entirely 100%, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batter gets to show up is a tough nut.
Lyth got seven hats - just like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could complain about is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean - even though Lyth was in the best shape - but this wasted opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a batsman I value very positively.
He's an x-factor cricket player that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he got 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will, of course, depend on the United Arab Emirates' overall lineup.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, was raised, and I have no objection to it.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't launch, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 to them, and there's no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 exams before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded in three centuries and didn't even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the chance to follow him, I was intrigued by him as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistic - on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and I see it as a spring, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the senators chose youth.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointment of Mahel Jayawarden, a batter from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial games can be a masterful move.
He is one of the most beautiful men playing, who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and merciless spark.
I've always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes got one day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even if many disagree, coaches and selectors don't make a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-advised strategy of renationalization to keep Britain in the EU is getting into further trouble with every past day, even without the choice of a brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to lead the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take over the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have had enough of the British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the treaty that they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUCs decided they didn't want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolis, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then come home saying they're winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to see Britain in Europe - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they do not care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German cautious Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes bad for her, as was the case with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see them break their legs in helping Selfie the British, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless comments of SNP style during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, says my friend.
"The renegotiation solved the problem," and "Britain has nothing of value in the negotiations."
Europeans know to their own detriment how ferocious Fleet Street can be and how skeptical oligarch barons are against the EU, because they were not inspired by Tony Ben in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at a 2: 1 rate.
They may vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, the sneaky Euro-opportunist, who made his name as the Brussels rapporteur "EU straight banana" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-free villains, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo non-overseas departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a vicious gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routines, since Blair admitted the principle of the repealed EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and obtained a firing card.
The press never forgave him, either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back of Westminster on Monday - I told him that he must not waste any more time on me - seems in danger of readopting the boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC chair he left on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people beyond the frantic tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly go for it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't commit to admitting that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Bennie's phrase - apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to say - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of television broadcasting and especially in the faith, the parlour of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free pass to Europe, which would allow him to take the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic curvature about EU membership - in line with their Bennite-besieging economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his outbursts about Nato - Tom Watson believes that JC's campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed in Britain's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday of the launch of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticize the review of the electronic publication by Public Health England
A statement by the government, funded by the Agency, that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, reported by researchers.
Experts working in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published a "landmark" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the extent of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, an editorial in the expert magazine Lancet attacked a "extremely weak base," on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ questioned the claims that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They state that the public might expect that the claim made by PHE, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking ', are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to draw up an analysis of the multi-criterion decision (MCDA) model to synthesize its views on the damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had already received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the public health entrustment of BAT in the sustainability report, it states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting acknowledged the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding they allegedly received earlier from Philip Morris International tobacco company.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known electronic cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial financing in the paper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
A meeting at PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report produced in this group "eloquently admits," missing "hard evidence of the harm of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that the BMJ claim had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifelong smokers dies because of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not depict, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people per year die of smoking-related diseases and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they only bear a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end up with EastEnders, claims former Director Channel 4
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for deploying public service programs that are likely to be followed by only a handful of people in difficult broadcasting times, compared to its rivals, "the biggest rating show," and on channels like BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I am struggling with the idea that the BBC is entering and transmitting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without contributions from the state," said Johnson in the Upper House Communications Commission, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain royalties that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, production should be reduced at least in relation to programmes that others do not produce or enter into.
They're sending The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would send it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, pointless.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
To be honest, other channels would give their right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up on ratings' because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to ensure long-term support. "
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those by former Executive Director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more pampered public service programs of the BBC "go to BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they fulfil their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn income from royalties," but of course we are doing all these obscure programs that no one is looking at. "
They broadcast them at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the licence fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I urge you to find a more regressive system about who will get the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I would be surprised if they paid that much because they don't look at the BBC that much.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who spoke before the commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production had already been classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as a model public broadcasts in Australia and Canada and turn into "information, clarification and entertainment."
On the subject of Elstein's partnership, he said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which have been broadcast on TV only a handful, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by means of sound waves
This video shows how the sound impulses affect the direction that the tubers are moving.
Scientists raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The tiny patrols change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses function by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity with light
Scientists said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are injected into the patient's brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The spores don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when placed in fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that then pass through the worm's body.
The amplified ultrasonic waves operate in the ion channels TRP-4, which is located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, it is reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to control the tubers using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then used an ultrasound on such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
In many ways, the new method resembles optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
But Chalasani was told that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light that has to be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," said Chalasani.
It added that the method could also be found in the treatment of insulin-producing muscle cells and cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertising that shames the British arms trade.
Take a look at Amnesty International's anti-weapon market video.
Horrible killer drones!
Leg shackles that break ankles!
Shredder shots!
And electric stun batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The happy voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no doubt that this ad at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defence and security facilities of International Veselice at Excel Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with posters appearing at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important notice, Travel to DLR from September 15 to 18?" reads one, using the letters with the London metro signs with the DLR lines becomes the image of the tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend to the DLR... customers are required to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are made by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute all over London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 per piece of Allen key which allegedly "gains access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flypost "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to spectators outside the galleries.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another one of the posters against the arms trade is the health of the subway passengers.
The video Amnesty was seen on Facebook by over 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP working without a fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads - saw an empty spot in Excel's calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the creation of a more realistic risky company ad, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, we have achieved more people's attention."
"They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we now need is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture facilities are not traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside Excel, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In the press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army to "on the arm of the batting AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student college
11 years ago, I moved to college as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I bothered with - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the track can range from a slight to a nerve-racking to a completely appalling one.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you took a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why "you honestly don't even love Marmite, because people, it's just an extract of HAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't talk to if your eyelashes were on fire and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Leave people alone.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, movie evenings and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress up and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college come short.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of tracks turn into an out-of-the-room walk culture, which is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to see when your classmate is tired of socializing and maybe write to him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
A boy in my dorm used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Because you started going to college on top of a baking mania, knocking on someone's door, and a show with a plate of baked cookies seems a little less weird, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering home-made delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe everything will end up matching your face to a delicious surprise.
Of course, that's the subject of being a decent baker.
Incorrectly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and solids will probably guarantee that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their doors.
Stealing food is a common crime in college.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Check with the owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're furious inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwasher to punish a thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that keep people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little bit because it was 3: 00 in the morning and she had a test.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When they were finally quiet at 5: 00 in the morning, she let them sleep calmly for two hours and then she turned on her own music, locked the door, and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same dorm as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be incredibly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future husband, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would take over your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you can't control your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try talking to your weaknesses at least a little bit.
At an uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something - never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the doors and put the keys in the water bottle, which you will then put in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time getting pregnant with a seven-year-old Vik.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I came to terms with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to having a baby and I was looking for positive ones.
Unsure and being alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.
And I'm sure I had hope that we wouldn't be alone for long, and Eve is remembering her first pregnancy today.
She had already met an older Vasek on the Internet, who they started talking to about popular films.
He even brought Vítek and Vítek home from the maternity ward, but he didn't roll into the role of stepdad.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," described Eva on documentary series Four in that 3.
The theme of the third series of Czech TV is the search for happiness on the second attempt.
Thanks to part-time work and great help to mom and aunt, she managed to take care of Vitka and the financial security of the family.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a stranger's child did not screw up Vasek's affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítka's second birthday and now he understands Vasek as his father and also calls him that.
Even though Vasek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys fatherhood at sixty, according to his words, and he also pays more attention to children.
In addition to Vitka, there were two-year-old Leontíntínka and finally twins.
"Vasek has sailed into our family somehow naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother has never talked much into my relationships," says the smiling Eva.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins of Ema and Ela were born with a C-section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of bile acids, which are then found in excessive amounts in the blood pregnant and manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for an unborn fetus who is at risk of premature birth and death, most of the time, after giving birth, the mother goes away spontaneously.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vasek, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Eme was placed in the incubator in the Intermediary Department, where Vashka's niece, who was able to take over and accommodate her, works.
Elinka was bigger and right after the transfer from ICU to the room I had her with me, describing the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until the doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for kids to get pregnant in Eve's maternity ward didn't make her happy.
"I've been a crazy longing for both husband and children," remembers the difficult moments in the six-week ward between a four-time mother.
She and her husband were also considering signing a reverse, including because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
In the end, however, this did not happen, and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
Stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by CT1 on Tuesday night at 9: 45 p.m.
Quite a large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric double hoop and tight conditions.
The house didn't get bigger, but Vasek made Eve happy by installing the gas cooker to make the food for six more comfortable.
If he's the best, we'll take turns getting a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are particularly aware of the family's well-being and pleasant atmosphere, not the size or omeness of the house.
So far, we've all come together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess may be worse hidden in a small area and sometimes we cross the curling babies, but at least we're all close, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Vasek's work as an illuminator at the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes he goes out on the streets of Prague like a taxi driver.
In his sixty-year-old words, care for family and children's finances is physically manageable, but how long is it going to be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, I will one day be the one to support this family," says Eva in asking questions about the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but she's even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly a big deal for employers.
And when the worst happens, my husband and I can take turns taking turns for a cab, joking around with a cute blonde.
Apple has hit the yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays.
A more powerful processor, a camera with a larger resolution, a stronger chassis or a display that recognizes the power of touch, are in short the advantages of the recently introduced ninth generation iPhones.
The last two have also a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of the 6s and 6s Plus iPhones.
The current trend of Apple was that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
At the same time, the two-gram weight difference in opposition to the news was really negligible.
But this is far from true with new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight grew by 14 grams in the smaller model, and by 20 grams in the larger model.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year's affair with bending in Apple's pockets was greatly troubled.
The chassis of news is made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology in the news, which allows displays to recognize the power of touch.
In order to do this, the display had to be provided with an additional layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of the display of new iPhones has thus increased more than twice over the previous generations.
For smaller iPhones from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, for larger ones from 19 to 40 grams.
For an iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest used component.
The weight of just 143 grams is then achieved with this news thanks to the fat-free crust, which has touched most of the remaining components.
The larger model is the most heavy battery element used, but its weight has not changed in any way compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is visible at the display.
The weight of 5.5 "iPhone 6s Plus thus amounts to 192 grams.
As far as the new display technology is practical, it will only become apparent when used.
The first users will be able to test this already on Friday, September 25, when iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be sold in selected countries.
Have the snowflakes been the breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Italy, Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists succeeded in finding an interesting opportunity.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern people from different times, including wall paintings, tool remnants and so on and so forth.
In the 23A layer, which according to the instruments dates back to about 30,000 years ago, scientists discovered but something very reminiscent of the leftovers of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, there were traces of oat grains on the spot, which apparently passed the process of making such popular flakes today.
In this case, the grains are soaked first, then dried, rid of the cover, so called plouch, then evaporated and spread flat.
In the Paglicci Cave, grains that appear to have been heated or spawned were discovered, and then apparently crushed between two mill stones - at least evidence of use on two stones in the cave.
Scientists were therefore unable to demonstrate in their publication for PNAS magazine that there was a complete process of making flakes in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat snowflakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and perhaps even a warm one is, of course, completely logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before agriculture was created.
Indeed, if the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes surpassed agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station reports in the Transport Enterprise of the City of Brno.
So I once again listened to the report of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Nut-town, Spectre, Frazov, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit noisy, so the report by the male voice was a little less understandable than before when the stops were reported by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic, it is more recognizable than the deeper male voice.
While the DPMB argues that passengers themselves chose this announcer - I do not know who, I was not asked, but they certainly chose this from studio recordings made in total silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for several decades, so I know the proper names of all these stops by heart, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners who are not familiar in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and can finally, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop they were supposed to make was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of announcer - but better again the announcer - should be done again, and this time under the usual traffic noise and engine noise, in which the curling of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So we don't have to keep listening to the names of the Water Herspice station, the Peeping Tom, or the Immerné in the squeaky shrine that I transferred to in Komarov.
I suppose my old man's hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden during the one day that the bus stop announcer changed.
Before that day, I understood those reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the trackman's notes.
Today, few people know what the biggest and most clever of the party's governments were so-called comprehensive checks.
I took the liberty of remembering it.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatcher's office the minute the radio said it was just seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't meet the comrade chief, came a minute before you, and it seems he's not in the mood," the dispatcher remarked while I was enrolling in the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Tell me I'm driving around the precinct to revise the minor mechanization.
I can't do that. I mean, there's a background check today.
They're all scared shitless.
What's going on?
"You'll see," the dispatcher smiled.
Next time you'll be, too.
I ran out into the hallway.
That's when the chief's door opened and the chief showed up.
Uptight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of my uniform jacket.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, sinister tone that the old man answered.
"You play games," welcomed me by engineer Eva, an elderly lady whom I respected very much.
She said she was even chief before the comrades deposed her.
There's background checks, and you're gonna be there.
How many times have I asked what these complex background checks are, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they're once every three years, they all have to, and it's very unpleasant.
At least for some.
He said I'd see.
I pulled out of a clam fascikle with periodic reports and a phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice answered.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing... "I mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I've come at your command," I've omitted myself, the iceberg I've entered the chieftain.
The chief was sitting behind a desk looking at some paper.
"Comrade mechanic," he said after a while without raising his head and still looking carefully at the paper, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the paper on the table, leaned on the back of the chair, and leaned at me with the usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I was concerned.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised himself that I had worked very well in the last few months in office and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of a platoon at distance.
And now this?
You realize you're a line distance technician, and you have to act like one.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I stuttered that I've been using that greeting since I was a kid, that I was raised like that, and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
For a chief, it was like a red turkey cloth.
"You're on a socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," the arrogant chief.
Besides, you're still confusing the address of your superiors.
You say "sir" one time, you say "comrade."
But I'm not a chief to you, I'm a comrade chief.
The Vice-Presidents are comrades of the Vice-Presidents, the Top Trainers are comrades of the Top Trainers!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I said hello to you with a common civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," said the chief, who in the meantime calmed down a bit.
We'll talk about it later.
Anyway, remember, you don't have that chair up there on your pension.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his priority, it didn't look good with the person in question.
He had a cold, prickly look at me for a while, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also upset about his high-profile branding.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing God, a comrade-god, actually.
Jovial, pompous, authoritarian, arrogant, just as he could use it at the moment.
He's been told by everyone.
So be it, he's the chief.
In fact, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, as all the party members, but also the non-party ones, called him.
But the chief called many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He just wiped me out for total bullshit.
I thought about my ass, and it took a lot of pressure not to shoot him in the face.
But then I wouldn't go back to the pick-up truck, let alone be a groovy clerk.
What would I feed two kids from?
And a built-up house!
I felt like crying, but I took control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all so far, you can go," the chief finished the audience and started looking carefully again at the paper he had in his hand before.
They called me in at 11: 30.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to the questions of what and how, they said yes, it would be good.
Only Yojin bitterly uttered, as it used to be, that they couldn't throw us all out, because he would have to do the work of a comrade chief himself with his faithful, and that is that he would not be in danger.
The word "comrade" was emphasized as if he knew what the old man had wiped me for this morning.
There was a nice gathering at the chief's office.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table, other comrades who were supposed to decide on my official being or not being.
Kadruk, chairman of the ROH, employee reporter, special-purpose officer, sort of military contention, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from a long drive.
An ordinary track worker, panning the sleepers or pitchforks, threw gravel.
But also a former guard.
Rumor has it there was no fun with him back then, he said he was a pretty beast.
The bad languages said the school came out in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't know anything.
And when the prison was canceled, he ended up at a pick-me-up.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an insatiable pinecone in my throat.
Kadruk read the opinion from the civil committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids, et cetera, et cetera.
So far, so good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then an assessment from the party's street organization.
He copied the report from the civil committee, so hopefully they were both written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-term members of the party refused to appear in front of the review committee and subsequently stepped out of the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me hard.
Kadruk noticed and stopped reading.
The chief said to continue.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the city committee of the SSM, and that's where I was won as a candidate for the party.
Regardless of the parents who stepped out, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding in church, besides the National Committee.
I failed the party's trust in the worst way.
That's why I was cut off from her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I arranged a church funeral, even though she was a former member of the party.
With all this, I am showing a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When the beaker finished reading, only the chieftain's pen tapping into the table plate interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
And I kept saying, in my mind, "Communists - superhumans, Communists - superhumans." What have I gotten myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could have fixed the switches without some fucking clearance.
But now?
She took her career as a groove official before she started.
Get back in the platoon?
I don't think so. I'm sure the chief will fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade in question?" interrupted the tense silence of the chief with the question of the cadaver.
Well, according to the previous job report.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, the Kadruk wasn't twice.
On the trotters of sweat, he winked nervously, as if he had been examined himself.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," said the chief with a hint of juniors, but it was often a premonition of the storm.
At first sight he was praised, trained with distinction, graduated from industrial school, worked as a locksmith in the task pay, filled the standard with an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But the important thing is missing.
Where did you get the report, comrade? "he turned again to a beaker who felt that it was somehow starting to turn against him and that he might not even be a beaker very soon.
This is where the comrade gave it to me when he came in.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went into the precinct," the beak-beaker.
And there are no reviews required, and his was kind of an extra one, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were assigned to the technical function, this piece of paper was enough for you," the chief stated.
The beaker winked nervously and had nothing to answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss it later," the chief closed the matter and apparently the beaker was relieved.
He's held up for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
Suddenly he's calling me out, so it's over!
My eyes were blacked out, my eyes were hot.
There was a surge of remorse and accusations, and I knew that I was the ugliest creature in the world that didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That by planting an incomplete report, I misled the comrade of the cadre officer, and I didn't understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from the beaker at the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element, which, at the time of the construction of real socialism, supports and even participates in religious darkness.
That, that, there was a lot of what I had done, or maybe I'd still commit, and I prayed quietly that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I left the place as a mechanic.
I didn't care if they took my pickaxe.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," suddenly the party chairman called and strongly interrupted the chief's Levits.
Comrade here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did a stupid thing!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than closing the door to his side for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is once again worthy of our trust.
An uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he that well-read, or was he parting phrases from partisan training and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who should give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to rectify himself!
It's your partisan duty that no one can take away from you!
Actually, it's a party obligation for all of us, too.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, not only punishes, but loves.
When the Prime Minister was finished, no one would even listen.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief was ice-cold attracted in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's the kind of conclusion I was headed for.
They all gave the same heads, but you could see that they didn't believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a self-appointed principal care officer," I hesitated when I returned to the office and then cried.
It's a good thing everyone had lunch besides Eva the engineer.
That silently listened to my incoherent depiction of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked me if I'd like some coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the cooker and prepared cups.
In the meantime, she was talking about the cadre practices.
As one opinion, often full of praise, they put one in the hand, and the other, in which there is all the dirt, they send it to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to end up, I ended up at a pick-me-up, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our beaker?
All he cares about is what he'd eat or drink, and that's how it turned out.
"He gets it from the old man," she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Keep an eye on him anyway, he's very vengeful.
And the party president?
Basically a much worse chief, no humanitarian.
A zero from a pickaxe with a lot of power.
The coffee water started to boil, and the office suddenly filled with the scent of just poured coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in the cup, and I blended a hot potion in silence.
I hope I'm out of the woods.
Now I won't be fired, and the other background checks aren't for another three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief won't forget today.
Published in the anthology of the LITERATE ON TRATI II in the publishing house EPIKA
The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill over Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from far away because it is located on a 15-meter high mast.
The people around here call him "the fan on the Hlum."
For the municipality with 150 inhabitants it became even one of the elements of the municipal emblem which the municipality acquired for the occasion of the reunion of the native people in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time, and we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone knows it," said Mayor Jiří Masek.
The hairy wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Hlum in the past centuries was rare.
It was only in 1910 that the Bohemian representatives decided on a solution that then suited up to the mid-1980s.
In the village near the turn of Chíchov they had dug out a seven-metre deep well.
Three years later, they completed the well with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice, Moravia, with a cost of CZK 2,400," says the memorial inscription on the ground-floor fence of the mast construction.
The pump after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel finished in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, a new chapter in the fight for water began to be written: on that day in Hlum, a new water pipeline began to serve.
The wind pump was left with a disfunctional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
The dominance was activated at this year's native reunion.
It was only in 2008 that Chlumský decided to fix the wind wheel again and put it back on track.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced on average by half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but it had to be brought down the same year.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist wind bursts.
Then the bohemian dominance rested under the roof for several years.
Since this June, however, the wheel on the high mast has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the reunion, the village had the replica of the bike modified and replanted it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well into the blind arm.
And over the summer, we completely unplugged it, because there was little water in the well.
At least it turned empty.
"In autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Masek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel has reached the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind throughout the Highlands.
They have a similar feature in the character in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Green Hora in Vyškovsk, in Kuželov in Hodonín, Partutovice in Přerovska or in Police in Vsetín.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed to Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone else in my career," smiled 34-year-old Goian at a pre-game press conference.
George Hagi trained us back then. It was a shame we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we will not lose this time, "Goian continued.
It is this man who has played 60 matches for the Romanian representation who is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stop sign, he will face the invading of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people are coming, no hell, saying about the Greek battle of the Hybš Spartan.
And he has some idea of what he might be up to on Thursday night.
I know Fatai, who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Luciano.
I saw all their fights at the time.
I know he's a very good attacker, which is why he went to Sparta, said Goian.
Another footballer of the Prague club was not named, so the direct question came whether he knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and aimed at Czech journalists with an easy-to-read look.
"Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he set off.
We saw some videos, and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has the experience of larger clubs, you can say he holds the defense of Asteras, he's kind of their game organizer," observed the Spartan assistant Stanislav Heikal.
Goian has had his best years, but he can boast a very interesting football biography.
Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both United and City Manchesters, was interested in him at the time, but Steauy went to Palermo in Italy, playing for the Glasgow Rangers.
We're expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European cups, fighting for victory in the Czech league.
He's my favorite player in this game, but we're playing at home, and we want to start the group off with a good result.
Like Sparta, we'll try to win, said Goian.
I am in a room with Slovak goaltender Tomáš Košický, who is very excited about his competitors from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new residence should have a Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading shares in the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have a group seat in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far under the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on society, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's registered office, the shareholders consider placing the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange. '
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the prospectus of the security, which it will soon submit to the Czech National Bank for approval.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction involving only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no shares for subscription to the public or to new investors will be offered under this operation.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - at a later date, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," stated the company.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Czech Television objectivity test in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of coverage of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news session of Czech TV.
And how did it stand?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can broadcast Czech Television Events today.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the coverage.
Except for the first minute, when the CT informed of the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks on the police called the migrants euphemistically they ran out of patience - throwing stones and attacking metal bars), the current promoter propaganda was already going - consider the names of the individual reports yourself.
Critics of NGOs - a great deal of room for non-profit organisations that criticise the poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but as a chance.
Traveling refugees - ČT consistently uses the terms of a refugee or refugee and not a migrant.
What is particularly striking is that ČT uses consistently only and only small children and women in illustrations.
In doing so, she herself stated in the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants arrested in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda, which has been unprecedented since communist agitas.
I have to say, as an ex-journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I first got up to the apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
My fish fish fish have moved into the umakarta toilet.
Domestic fishes, insects with a transformative imperfections, i.e., failing the transformation from caterpillar to beetle and cub look like an adult individual, just tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't waste them.
First by hand and later by chemical means.
The Socialist drug store provided some kind of blue crystals to take them out.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But they were successfully liquidated.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs the same way.
A box with some kind of Juvenaliser that ants brought to their nest, and then he wouldn't allow the Queen to generate a new offspring.
But I took a turn.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I was increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
The truth about fleas and bugs wouldn't be too bad to make karma worse by killing them.
In our new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish don't crawl by our necks, let them eat some leftover skin chips in peace, some invisible algae, and so on.
Their peaceful existence after a while was disrupted by a spider.
It was a common kind of leper who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he lived off occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he lived with us for several years, we found that he mainly fed on fishes and that he probably kept their numbers on a kidnapping count.
With an intimate regular contact with every need we've done, we've found out that she's a female.
We have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, as he carefully plucks the web to avoid being eaten before reaching the desired copulation.
It took about three days when they didn't move or react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love play took place, we later found the remains of the dried-up male next to the female.
Then the spider hasn't moved in weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by a lot of little spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother, scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went somewhere else or passed out, we don't know, but after a month or two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the prehistoric toilet user.
For some time, from the ceiling, she observed our behavior with caution, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she evaluated our non-aggression as a friendship.
The number of fish has decreased again, and the spider has taken care of its normal activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed for a year.
In the meantime, our daughter came to an age where the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but we were already concerned about the eternal spill of its contents.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more strongly.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain her habit in the spider, which she saw very well while wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider didn't take my happiness at all in the house.
She was crying and screaming and forcing her potty.
There was no need.
The moment came when the spider, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift, had to take orders.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished across the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I was saying good-bye to him as a friend, but I still felt like I was throwing away a relative after living with him for so long.
We assumed that the fishes would start showing up more often and start multiplying by a geometric series.
Surprised, a week or two, none of them showed up.
I started speculating on the cause.
I was wondering if there was an ant-shaped spider that didn't grow, that the toilet environment wasn't as favourable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were crawling again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their connection to the spider must have been due to the fact that if they didn't see him, that he was hiding somewhere else and that they were in danger from anywhere else.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his quick disappearance caused some kind of alarm reaction.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their sight.
Some light showed shyness, but that they would react to waving hands or fast movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten the potty.
All we have to do is attract another spider.
I'm already sending my wishes to the air, and I hope they didn't give up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use Cyclone B.
The ten statements of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century may never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive into everything so deep that the figment was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In particular, the general and special theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio, has entered into people's awareness.
It is also not possible to ignore its clarification of the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is so complex for many that they prefer to choose easy meanings to get to know each other.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn't have been Albert Einstein if he hadn't found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: An hour near your beloved seems to be a minute; a minute in the hot furnace seems to be an hour - and that is relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his entire pleade of famous quotes these ten, which literally caught my eye.
Smart people try to solve problems, brilliant people try not to.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove I was right.
But the only thing that can prove me wrong at any time.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what's going to be fought in World War III, but in the fourth, it's going to be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but there are no ways to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself for not introducing Einstein's formula to the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
The hospitals in Zlín County are expecting changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four of them are holding in black numbers all this year," said Chief Inspector Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the regional facilities at the moment is about CZK 32 million.
This is mainly due to higher remuneration from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that, after poor years, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlína, construction is about to take place, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period of buying mainly machines is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top health care is impossible to do, justified by the plans of the Regional Secretary for Health Lubomír Netime.
He's looking forward to the changes in all the hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospital next year.
In Vsetín, they now select a supplier of a new internal pavilion for nearly 300 million crowns.
In Kroměříž they have scheduled addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new boarding house to this year's open central pavilion for about 200 million.
And Zlín's Bata Hospital awaits a long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internment that will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Věra Pruskova, hospital director, for example, for the construction of the St Martin's interns.
The five-story building is due to be ready in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, beds and intensive care.
More comfort for patients.
Changes, which are mainly known by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which for example many patients lie in one room, on the floor they have only one toilet, beds are unstoppable, windows are leaking and health professionals do not have the right conditions for work.
"For example, our boarding house was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the verge of its lifetime," said Pavel Calábek, Director of Zlin Hospital.
Within a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected to an urgent income.
Physicians and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, plus in new areas.
The same model is half finished with the Hungarian Hradic.
The central income is already up, and in three years' time, it's gonna have an intern in it.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the county.
It still has the highest profit, and it did not get to the loss even two years ago, when the Zlín hospital, for example, faced almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, increasing income and managing costs effectively throughout the hospital," named Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
The patients of the Kroměřské hospital will also get better.
Within ten to fifteen years, it will go to repairs, new equipment and reconstruction of up to half a billion crowns.
This year we will be ready to repair the detention station, then the extension of dialysis or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one has explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD), after negotiations with his European colleagues, complains that the other countries of the Czech Republic are pushing for the adoption of quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
It also points out that no one has yet explained to him how the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should be kept if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive an answer, which is why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," said the breeder to the journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with at the meeting of the European Union's Ministers for the Interior and Foreign Affairs?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot function.
We can't talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings that have visions, go somewhere, have relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not get an answer, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots - registration sites, border control, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things - we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas solve everything?
A while ago, we were dealing with 40,000, now it's 120 grand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who cross over us want to go to Germany.
No one wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese, and others who treat the Czech Republic as a target country, are expected to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don't even want to come to us, but we've already committed to receiving 1,500 people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border control, military operations.
The 1500 is that there will be 1100 people to handle the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we treat the ones we picked up.
It is a big question, and we will be discussing this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe treats it like they can't be detained if they have a registration.
This means they will come to our territory with a registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, we may not even keep the 1100 in the Czech Republic and they will leave Germany again after they arrive.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98% of European statistics show that they receive international protection.
Then they will be given documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people are going to end up in the target countries again.
Then there are 400 people who will be resettled.
This is the second project that is going on so far, and there we have only made progress in discussing with churches the possibility that they could help them get jobs, housing and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting, the other states were unwilling to discuss it with us.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic simply rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity to block the debate?
And what exactly is this supposed to be, in your opinion, a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can reach them, the report will spread in the hours of all camps around Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It calls for another migratory wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want to join us.
We think that the road is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage the migratory waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Unequivocally let them know they don't stand a chance.
Only last year, 50,000 people came to Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, prosecutors.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, the fifty percent of what social systems are spending on them today in vain could go to the refugees.
Contrary to the first day that Germany introduced checks, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, on the first day it was 12.
How far is this going to go to make border controls even tighter?
We were afraid of getting caught in hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we hold will be returned to Austria in seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, it's complicated with Hungary, and the Greeks - that's a completely pointless story.
So where's the breaking point?
Would it have to be, like, a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacity enough to get the emergency plans in.
Then I have agreed with the Prime Minister that he would convene an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation were to arise, the government could sit de facto immediately, and by one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police for an army, let us say the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme alternative is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will try to divert the migratory flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct road to Austria.
This would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debt at the last minute.
They're trying to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid her debts.
Even the football players got their money.
Soccer Slavia stood up for the first time on Tuesday for insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after the Online Services from Pacific Samoa submitted a proposal for it for about CZK 20 million.
The counsel Slavie Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlo within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And I have to say, she did.
One of the main arguments was that the new owner of Slavia was the great Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimán.
Apparently, money has arrived from the new owners to the club at the last minute.
This is also demonstrated by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the Vršovice Club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," said the lawyer Slavia Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovak exrepresentative Milan Ivan or the Czech reservist Mario Liček.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday the club also paid the due fees of the Prague 10 district.
As a result, only the claims which Slavia disputes remain de facto part of the insolvency dispute.
Either the club did not make the commitments at all, or they are in litigation.
However, we are prepared to pay the sums in the event of the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove by a statement from the account," said Advocate Mládková.
"Everything that was past due is paid," said Mládková, and added that only outstanding or diverted liabilities were not paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not make a decision in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid off the debts.
Subsequently, all evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected at the earliest in November.
The judge ordered the negotiations to continue on November 3rd.
However, the decision will not be taken at this meeting, but in writing after it.
Medals for the Finns and the Austrians.

Flexibility is ensured, fewer downtime, more welding and more profit.
It is this year's new premiere in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We very much appreciate these honours, as they confirm the exceptional nature of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameters control, FastMig X is one of the world's top.
The delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly pleasant for the interested parties.
We have already established our first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly spread after the Brno trade fair.
We have been its regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, emphasizes for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi shop in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanca was built so she wouldn't fail.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blank could have been hit more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way as to avoid two sinks of soil in Prague's Stromovka, the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday evening during a press tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was more secure, but the cost grew exponentially," said Butovic.
The conditions in Stromovka were, according to him, the same all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it started to move through a safer and more cautious method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří White Head, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, said the Weekly Euro.
The construction was intended to cost CZK 17 billion.
If you add VAT, which jumped twice over the construction period, out of 17 billion, you have 21 billion.
When technology, land purchases and engineering, valuations and similar items add up, it's 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37, said White Head.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings by clicking on the "General" tab and selecting "Software Update" (software update).
When ready, your phone will offer you the option to download it and then install it.
Some users encountered a problem after installation, namely the error message "software update failed '.
One of the solutions to this problem is to wait until the interest in updating falls, or to try it through iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the update process.
However, this will not be necessary, including the need to uninstall the site release app, because Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the process by using a special tool to design the user's applications to delete and reinstall after the update has been completed.
Make sure your phone is charged before you start the update.
If the battery condition is low, Apple will not allow the update to start because the process interruption could cause an update error.

FedEx's profits mixed, reducing the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results in the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of year-round profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs for land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares dropped by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx states that it expects a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a fall of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes by 4.9 percent on average, despite an increase in interest rates, which will be reflected in January. 4, and higher charges for land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth over the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The chairman of Fred Smith's board of directors and CEO said that the company "showed firm performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
Vacation plans were announced the day after UPS indicated that it was planning to hire between 90 000 and 95 000 additional workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx received $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
The sales went up by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a fall in priority international shipping, which has caused revenues to stagnate in its Express Unit.
But boom in online shopping boosted FedEx ground unit results.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29%, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income because of higher basic rates, while profit fell in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trade, about an hour before FedEx's shares were opened, it fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent a year and 17 percent below the 11 June record.
At its most anticipated meeting over the years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table, deciding whether, after almost ten years, it is time to raise the key interest rate.
Rowing over them at one end of the Central Bank Ornament, a two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed's leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy has been ready to launch in the process of shutting down from unprecedented stimulus in the form of an almost zero short-term interest rate on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data show solid growth in the economy, recent turbulence in the world's financial markets could scare the cautious Fed by adding to volatility by raising its federal fund reference rate - no more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour and inflation market will be the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, an increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of financial market nervousness.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Blomberg anticipated an increase in the rate this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed would only raise rates if politicians soften the decline by promising that there would be no further increase in sight.
On Tuesday, the industrial average Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The rally was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would hold rates this week, says John Lonski, the chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed would now raise the rates," he states.
If the Fed politicians had done this, "they would have had to go to great lengths in their programming statement and hold the financial markets by hand in order not to panic."
Other experts claimed that raising rates would calm the financial markets, because it would remove uncertainty from the Fed's progress.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that, over the spring and early summer, he was expecting an increase in rates this year, despite complaints from liberals, that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years, and is close to what the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lifting.
And, while inflation continues to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed politicians argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labour market," said Ian Shepherd, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to wiggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones' industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that China's slowing economy would run down global growth.
The market was somewhat reflected in this month and Dow is now losing only almost 10% of the May Maximum.
A comprehensive calculation of the beginning of the interest rate increase is supplied to the Fed's political leaders by the turbulence of the market.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets, and reports of Chinese economy weakness in the last few weeks, there would have been tightening up at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
It now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on regarding the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered convulsions all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly linked, the Fed's leaders can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but they also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve in Richmond, Va., remarked this month that "The Fed has a history of exaggerations with movements in financial markets that seem incoherent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy making, who pushed for tariff increases, quoted the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "Despite the limited identifiable effects on US growth," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed's leaders reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only prioritise concerns about financial stability during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Committee setting rates in the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil does not even approach this level, he stated.
"You certainly do not want to be in a situation of fear of tariff growth, because the markets got angry," said Posen, President of the Institute for International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown, not a Thai Quarter.
Market / warehouse is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little bit of motor oil.
The store is massive, and it's gonna take you over an hour to get through all the alleys.
If you're hungry from all this shopping, go get a meal at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal shopping stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various sampling points.
What's in stock: do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and lots of items are sold in bulk.
The limits of fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and others.
The spread of the meat is large, for example, fish - workers behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezer section where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork guts, fish balls, regional sausages, free selling semi-finished products and more.
Who shops here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
Wide alleys come to meet shopping carts and forklift carts.
Found: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial area of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburb of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways stays the same.
Acceleration to 150 km / h was denied by the House.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed up to 150 km / h under favourable conditions.
This was decided by the House on Tuesday when it agreed to an amendment to the Senate, which refused to increase speed.
The amendment to the Road Act is now heading towards the President.
President Milos Zeman has already said at the end of April that he would veto the law that allows for 150 kilometers of speed.
The Transport Minister Dan Jok (YES) was also opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
On Tuesday in front of the MPs, Jok supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane roads.
First, the House extended this possibility to motorways on which to drive in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km / h, but the Senate refused.
The Members have now agreed on his proposal.
The Senators, with the approval of the Minister for Transport, also excluded the traffic police from having the last word in the local communications that the municipalities care about.
The Senate version, which has been approved by the House, also envisages that sewerage, water ducts or cables of public lighting can be stored lengthwise below the road surface.
The municipalities would have saved money to buy the land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land in question.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and facilitate the management of towed vehicles by municipalities to which owners do not apply.
The municipalities could now sell towed vehicles that are not registered within six months of the date of notification of the withdrawal.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory through the roads of second and third classes, under the threat of a fine, even for forwarding companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic motorway signs instead of existing paper, which will continue to apply after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The esteemed ex-mayor is on trial.
He's looking at 10 years for overpriced welcoming citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced citizens' welcome project.
The police also wanted to prosecute Zuzan Kail in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both of them are facing ten years in prison.
The main trial is scheduled for two days of October.
According to the prosecutor Mandek and Macek, they caused damage of at least one million crowns, resulting from the prosecution.
The plaintiff relies on an expert opinion.
The former members of the city's management, according to the plaintiff, have, by virtue of their duties, made it possible to obtain the property benefit of the company which organised the reception of the citizens.
According to the indictment, the Mandate ordered the then head of the Municipality Department of City Services, Education and Culture to address five connected companies in the tender.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, City Hall cancelled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the contract to the administrator and only Darothore company entered the competition, which was then awarded by the City Council.
The city paid at least a million more.
The two allegations led by the aim of ensuring the award of a public contract to Darothore for the organisation of the "Welcome of Citizens' event in Ústí nad Labem 'in a long and coordinated manner have acted at least contrary to the requirement of a proper economy care procedure, written by the prosecutor.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore, after obtaining this contract, would charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the "Welcome of Citizens" event a price that would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the project file, the company collected more than CZK 5 million.
In the end, only one part of the city paid off, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was overpriced by at least a million crowns according to the expert opinion.
He's already refused any violation of the law before.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this constructed case, said the former mayor, saying that the city under his leadership only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
The event was provided by Roxy II between 2008 and 2010.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," added Mandík.
The CSIs wanted to charge Mrs Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
But the House of Deputies did not release it for prosecution.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in its case, but they are counting on Kail to be charged after her parliamentary mandate is over.
The reception of the citizens was a social event which took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns to buy children's items and small gifts.
Hungarian police said they let a dog loose on a fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
The Hungarian police said that on the border with Serbia they had briefly apprehended the AP cameraman and forced him to delete the footage of a police dog allegedly hitting a fugitive on the ground.
However, the Hungarian Government is questioning this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossing the border with Serbia.
The police have taken action against the refugees, and one of them left a certain Syrian to attack a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he rolled, says Muzi.
One of the cops noticed that Muzi was filming everything and he wouldn't let him leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to make any phone calls to his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The police took Muzi to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had on tape.
Then they ordered him to delete the footage.
In this way, the man lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
AP sent a protest letter to the Hungarian Government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police behavior unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying legally acquired material.
Kovács, referring to Muzi's police report, questioned the trial of events.
He said the cops just wanted a journalist to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they had a right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't make him do anything.
"Dogs can bark - they are trained to scare and intimidate a little, but did not attack with certainty," says Kovács.
Unpredictable Champions League.
The City win will kick our asses, believe Juventus
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," was Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of home City, shaking his head.
We had more chances, and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Not a single team has created a lot of opportunities, but we've had the ball on our kicks longer.
"The cause of defeat was not in the tactic, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," assessed the match Pellegrini, whose team cashed in the contest after a long 636 minutes.
The finalist of last season Juventus was exactly the opposite before the meeting - after the first three rounds of the Italian League he has only a point as a champion of the title and with a score of 2: 4 is located up to the 16th place of the table.
That's why turning to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us," says Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manjukich and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is so important, perhaps thanks to it we can ride on a victory wave," hopes Morata.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attack phase.
That's what my players deserve.
"On the contrary, before our balancing goal, we could collect at 0: 2, but Gianluigi held us back," praised Coach Allegri Goalman Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances," regretted Yayu Touré, the City Backup.
We must take from the Champions League experience and try to achieve a better result next time.
Good-bye, Angela. Good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media crackle around is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies carrying on their parents' hands on dusty trips of exodus.
This automatically causes a person - that is, a European person - to feel guilty and compassionate.
Well, they don't just come here desperate babies, notice on the footage of the landing boats to the Greek islands that the babies can't see that much on them!
Well, lately, we've been missing pictures of ships headed for Lampedusa, refugees outside the French border at Menton, where thousands of young men lie at the beautiful promenade.
For the most part, young black men.
And the pictures from Callais, where they eat and black men wait to get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's touching it anymore.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of Eritreans have somehow not made a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of it was fake.
So, when it comes to refugee quotas, it is somehow concealed that it is not only the unhappy children from Syria, but also the published - for the elderly: fashionably handsome - young men.
Whose musculature looks like they just crawled out of some fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of the fact that she was private, a large group of cars came to the beach at once.
But no ham.
And out of them came the young black men.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In the hands of, of course, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they weren't interested in them, and the workers - Turks, Muslims! - were clearly afraid of them.
They've taken all the couches.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like American rappers.
On the heads of a hat with a nail, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started to feast.
They took the tables around, stuffed themselves next to the sitting brown and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and kids were running away from the dining room terrace somewhere quiet.
The coming blacks drank beer straight from the third graders - as they threw empty bottles around on the beach in shows from the USA?!.
They kept yelling at each other loudly.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight out of bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer bathing suits, especially those young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, mothers and children and pensioners fled horribly and in half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had, like, a 20-inch, massive gold cross on his neck.
And women were like jewelry stores.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw them drinking," said the waiter.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me yet.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the secret service and top politicians should have known first.
They don't seem to know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, the European Union's main problem has proved to be that totalitarian-policy-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and linked to them by lobbying and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly recognized as a major force in Europe - lie, lie, and lie - but not only them, but also the top of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow TV from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunbakers at the station, but most of all, the old German Muslims welcomed their tribal council.
For weeks, they've been babbling on the news on Czech TV, as they say, almost all Germans are for the arrival of emigrants, according to some research.
But whoever's been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by further information.
For example famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Society of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs were talking about.
But they hid what broke the next day in Germany: that in the poll for the article, 94.5% of Germans did not want any more immigrants - 67 000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly, in November 2010, five years ago, declared: "Our efforts for multi-culture have completely failed the company."
She then said, "Germany is giving up the fight for multicultural society."
"All efforts to live together have completely failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it said that a strategy that allowed people from different cultural environments to live side by side without integrating. Today they live here with us and we lied for some time that they would not stay, that one day they would disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach, where we say that we just live happily next to each other, has failed.
It totally failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
Conflict is rapidly increasing.
EuroGerman Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, the MEP for the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not even have a degree in the EuroParliament - yes, that is the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play as a concentrate officer from a minute on - has shown himself more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of German politicians' latest statements, that Germany has crossed Rubicon.
Let us note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
The rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who for years have tried, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and a murderer of millions?
Are those who say that there is a devil of aggression, superiority and violence in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped, with all his strength, the attempts by the Germans to take over the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess I did.
When they shut him down, the preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Grand Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, has probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt by Marxists to dominate the state, for example, with the Rome Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany, based on ecology, by the way, one of the main ideas of Nazism.
We'd say sunflower.
German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving all those anti-atom fighters, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, silently supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogans our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who want to do something different and better all over the world, they have fully opted for the planet's warlords, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called Propolestine - and anti-Slavic current, which considered all Slavs to be difficult to recruit - since Karl Marx, who, after the Jewish parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
Also, as the latest statements of Schulz and the German minsts openly threatening the disobedient eastern states show, the idea of Germany's leader.
Which must be listened to without rebuttal.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we add that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
As always, the capital is behind this, especially the German capital that it suits, which is that Germany, through banks and the Union, actually controls most of Europe's countries.
First, the pseudovir of sunflowers led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multi-clturalism, and today, it brought home to them and possibly millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the voices of the siren, will soon come across a wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and begin to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours again with force, once again with a part of its inhabitants - but it seems to be an ever smaller part - to mislead them ideologically, but in the end, reality, as always, will catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostel is on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
To help Muslims who have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated enough to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, following the fear of Islamization of their country, get into one another?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany at all, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new euro-human Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict created in Europe by the promotion of Sunshine ideology, that is, the ideology of elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the rude behaviour against disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, it can't go well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of pushy vendors: scare them to death.
You just knock and a sturdy tap comes down on you in a way that the weaker nature doesn't have to stand up to.
The revived head will wipe you off and drive you away, accompany (or rather drive away) the persistent seller and the revived statue.
Maybe it's too bad you can't actually get a talking tap.
Even with us, it would be good to chase away a lot of hookers and bastards.
Pale (Oxalis corniculata).
A tiny weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it is located between the outside tiles near my residence.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is part of expansive weeds, but looks to give a nice impression in terms of flowering.
It is located between the outside tiles.
It's erratic, it thrives in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, easy to adapt, modest and easy to use.
It creates leaves with chaotic composition, but it is worth watching and taking pictures.
The beauty of detail is still under the microscope - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet during breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of a good diet when breast-feeding using images of children eating from breasts painted by depicting unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic production of their children and protected them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets were adversely affecting the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, even though Nine's is trying to take the lead on the Today Show.
By fleeing Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry to cover the cost of the escape of liberal leadership, it has not been possible to create a sufficient increase in the evaluation for Today.
The Nine Morning Show, projected from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise and host David Koch and Samantha Armytage got stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance did not seem to matter so much to the audience Aussie TV, because it recorded 397 000 viewers in five capitals in average terms compared to 330 000 viewers on Today.
Today recorded a small increase in its rating compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was only past Thursday (343 000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in the last few months.
In August there was an average of 318 000 in Today compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 spectators and Today has 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect this morning more than just parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters by Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand, has on average a very impressive 1,219 million spectators.
Critics were wondering if Thomson himself could pull off a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night indicates a clear "yes."
The X Factor by Seven has kept 1,136 million viewers strong, thereby beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000) smoothly.
Seven recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz (from 17.00 to 17.30), which Andrew O'Keefe 'presented, had an average of 446 000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 17.30 to 18.00) jumped 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the second half had an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the fall in The Chase Australia's second night ratings, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5: 30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a Million Dollar Minute show that couldn't beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secrets revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Sneana Markoski may have accidentally found out who's gonna win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay in the country will definitely not reveal who's the one who gets the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Szneany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they unwittingly told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut till Thursday's final.
All three women were lyrical about why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why he would want to be his partner.
In any case, when asked, "If not, which will get Wood's final flower?," their answers may have worked as a spoiler about who will win the heart of Bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt that they were quite compatible and still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They're fine and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visits at home, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this wasn't just a game anymore - I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls just as much - it's between Snezen and Lana's tie.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his transfer to the United States, and a lot of teams were asking questions after his great start to practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsulo, and it seems like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by the conversion of the Australian rugby league at the first pitch of the 20-to-3 tournament to Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the match.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only care about the next game.
Already during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne fixed his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for in their NFL debut.
Hayne was captured in the swearing when he left the field after an error, and later said to the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 the worse start of his career in the NFL he could not even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goal territory led to the Queensland Three.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans on which he holds the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin will meet in the debate on gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested while pointing guns at a Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts restricted.
The TSA stood up for emigrants who claimed compensation for their property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989 it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the State for compensation under the Act on extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The Court of First Instance awarded them the amount required, i.e. more than CZK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim in such a way that it granted them only under CZK 90 000, referring to the fact that the amount of the refund is determined according to the price regulations of 1991.
The emigrants stood up for the Supreme Court and credited them with the amount originally sued.
But the Treasury Department, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to a complaint about the GPA.
In the meantime, there has been a change in social and economic circumstances that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although at that time the compensation was adequate in relation to the property withdrawn - is now only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of the interveners as a restitution of beneficiaries who have claimed their rights since at least 1995 and who have not been able to obtain compensation before," explained the Judge-Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk why the ÚS took over the emigrants' side.
"The ÚS has repeatedly argued that the general courts should proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistency should not be interpreted to the detriment of the beneficiaries and that the purpose of the restitution legislation, namely the atonement of the property injustices caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state, should always be achieved," added the judge.
Evita will now be portrayed by Radka Fisharová in the musical Studio DVA.
Radka Fisharová, by the way, became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998 she played the role of wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague theatre Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says, "To this day, the difficulty of Evita has not been much compared to the performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monica Absolon recommended her as the first lady of Argentina.
I've seen Monča three times in Evita, and it's certainly been inspiring for me.
Here I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern modifications, but this one is simply particularly successful.
"Directed by Ondřej Sokol is original, light and contemporary," says Fisharová.
The musical scepter between the two singers will be handed over to Monica Absolon's Birthday Concert on September 27th at 7 p.m. at Studio DVA.
The evening will culminate in the music of Evita.
The experience will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Quiet your crying, Argentino!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also walk away from the overhead counter when he represents Charles Roden as President of Perón during the film.
For public interest, additional dates were then added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita presents the Theatre Studio DVA in cooperation with The Real Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondřej Sokol, Monica Absolon originally studied the main female role.
By her side, Karel Roden appears as President of Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenachik.
The legendary songs from the workshop Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the Czech texts Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who was already involved in the first introduction to the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police officers shot rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of demonstrators against the draft of a new state constitution, put an official on Wednesday.
Violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, states that more than 1000 protesters have gathered outside the police station and some have thrown stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians have been injured, reporting.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern plains of Nepal, where the members of Madhesi's ethnic group said that they had set up a new province under the proposed new constitution, and mitigated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in West Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which calls for the creation of its own state.
Since August 10th, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very questionable issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week in Kathmandu on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We're definitely not allowed to panic right now.
After losing on the ice of the master Litvinov you couldn't even handle the home duel with the hockey players Sparta (3: 5).
Aren't you worried about a similar catastrophic entry into the extreme a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands has a probability of 60 percent in the formation of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday by the American National Hurricane Center.
Another well-defined low-pressure system around the middle between Cape Verde and the Little Antilles also has a 60% probability of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added weather prognostics based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it is launching a campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states in their escape from war-torn and poor countries. Google will double every amount it has collected.
Google announced this on his blog in a very unusual way.
The report on her blog was published by Google employee Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience when she fled with her family from Kabul as a seven-year-old.
"We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But more and more families like mine are willing to help with the worsening immigrant crisis in Europe.
All contributions will be allocated to 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made via google.com / refugeerelief will double up to $5.5 million.
Europe has faced the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, driven away by a four-year war, which has only driven out 4 million people this year.
Many people are also fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For a slightly obese diabetic could be useful surgery weight loss
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say if slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"Mortality data takes a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on a new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, barriotic surgery use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and reducing the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or more.
The BMI, which measures the weight relative to height, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
BMI values of 25 or higher suggest overweight and people above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan have used data collected from a study since 2007 that deals with two types of barriotic surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
In the meantime, the BMI of those who were not given surgery to treat diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36% and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1% and partly only about 2% of patients were completely resolved for comparison of diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were also shown to be "generally superior in the surgical group," found by authors.
Researchers also monitored the patient 's haemoglobin levels of A1c in the blood, which reflects the continuous level of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below the level of 7 percent, reported by researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at about 8%.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of Hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After five years, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reached greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and Hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent), and had a greater probability of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studying stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who had had a barriotic operation had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years than a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, this is a soothing result for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, states.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously after a drop in the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to show people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that will connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to capture all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is engaged in a study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that, under the current circumstances, humanity's interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems, "he added.
In dealing with the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also spoke about the charges against George Bush after 9 / 11 of the terrorist attack and claims that "the violent reaction of the US has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to resolve this problem was not a violent journey.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
4-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested a sanitation agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centres around the United States reported almost 400% growth from 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to a toxicological centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylor Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of sanitation products consumed in children under 12 years of age reported to be poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately, there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink sanitation on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking sanitation because of cheap fuss.
Supposedly, the Nazis mixed their sanitation agent with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive scent of the product.
"Children don't think it could hurt them," said Lopez.
A lot of the more attractive (sanitation equipment) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitation products with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges that are very attractive to children.
The sanitation agent contains between 45% and 95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, several drops may mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 Station in Kansas City Medical Director of the Control Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey lying around, but people leave these sanitation products outside, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four ounces of sanitation agent with the scent of strawberry and was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol levels were .179, which is twice the threshold for being drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indistinct words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors were monitoring her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and hit her head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaijah.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers the use of non-alcoholic products or to ensure that sanitation products are out of reach of children.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some sanitation agents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a sanitary device containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The health care professionals considered that the product contains methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "evil" teachers by placing antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has banned their presence in the room.
The police considered a failed plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Rumour: No inconsistency in Team Celtic
Griffiths is downplaying the talk of a dissent in Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he's gonna turn it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will interfere with the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty of ADAM Rooney has secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittoria, which has given Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies the talk of inconsistencies
This situation has caused rumors of a mismatch in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for the fight against Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers' backup and former Netherlands representative Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently ambassador to Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic games, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in right now.
There's a lot of tension at Old Company games, and not just the people of Scotland watching these games.
I'll turn things back to good, commit to Deila.
ROONY Dealia admitted Celtic was stumbling a little, but the Norwegian boss made a commitment to turn things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent fall from the Champions League was quickly followed by the defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Delia says, "Celtic has had a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current situation.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about January's reinforcements.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his January goals, the head of Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the great buying of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford says, "January's transfer window is very different from the summer one."
Players who come in summer have an entire preseason for housing, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage occurs by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target indicates retirement.
Swansea Michu's assailant, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea was terminated.
A 20-year-old gunman has had problems with a susceptible ankle for two years and has failed to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA for comments against Neilson.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - it is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which has been revoked.
Neilson stands by his claim and says, "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths has committed to avoiding Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting that he sang a song with a text aimed at former players Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby, and it was a tightened moment," the assailant said and goes, "I can safely say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless it's in the Celtic jersey."
Council in Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in fixing the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the downfall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boy for action again, "says Donnelly.
MCInnes is happy for the "ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had desperately held up against Hamilton Accies in order to get the seventh league victory in a row and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the penalty of the first half of Adam Rooney.
McInnes says, "There's no team that won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while UK's overall unemployment is rising.
EMPLOYMENT IN Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total unemployment rate in the UK increased by 10 000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate was 5.9% above the UK rate (5.5%), as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12 000 over a period of three months, with the number of workers now halted to 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the British average of 73.5 percent.
In his comments, the Secretary of State of Scotland David Mundell said: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year Scotland has made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market, and Scotland's employment has increased, while unemployment has fallen.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will be watching a man die.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's death chamber, and I'll see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials to witness his death.
I first received an invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to get scared.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of jobs for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will be watching the entire execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to memorize all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have put it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could take me off the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help with the death penalty procedures.
Kim Bellware, journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want more information about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I've created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of accessory to the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will be watching him die.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
To this end, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die in vain.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after he cleared the Canning River men.
The bet of a man from Pemarket running away from the police didn't come out after he got into shallow muddy water just three feet away from a cop trying to get him to come back to shore.
Canning Vale police have been called in in an incident exceeding Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come and get me'," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use a safer tactic and the police negotiation. "
"Sometimes people try to do funny things when they escape," said Castledine.
Football champion Ben Cousins sets a memorable example.
In 2006, Coulins drove his car into a ditch to avoid the bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cassins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race.
Peeter Moody accused the organizer of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatening to stop racing immediately.
He focused on the organizers and integrity department of Racing Victoria and based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratch on Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive swab for cobalt, which he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about the espionage charge for 18 months, and he didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody released in his interview for a racking bomb that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out about things that are being done in my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an effort to catch me, they totally blew me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and make people outside of the coaching position take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now will give them material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really made me sad.
I will push them and carry on the burden of making a decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can go away.
The levels of frustration of the coach increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratches made him feel like "he could watch his license on the table."
Mood, the best known for preparing the undefeated champion of Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on the day of the race "ridiculous" after a clay cladding or mud was applied to the horse's feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for the treatment of tiles on the day of the race, for which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobram driver who got away was arrested.
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram this weekend and left after the collision.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to Shepparton Police.
He is expected to be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable condition in the hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy strikes back on rivals for wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' procedures as "plan setting" by two NRL favorites premiership.
Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters' coach, said that the referees allowed Storm players to wrestle his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the Sydney qualifying finals on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, head coach Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark on Strorm after his team won the qualifying finals over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "show" rugby league and according to him two of Queensland were not "too big" on wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' procedures and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence because his team is being criticized by two leading coaches, which may mean they're afraid of losing from Team Storm.
"It keeps coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," he said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can guarantee that over the last year we haven't changed any of our defensive systems and techniques, for the past few weeks we've just been emphasizing contact during the procedure, and that meant a turnaround for us.
Trent's been here three years, and he's obviously been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy derailed Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team, St George-Illawarra Dragons, won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also as exciting, "said Bellamy.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that he finds devastating, especially his young backups with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd like to play if you had this type of player.
He said this opinion in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backups like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me feel more confident because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals were played in Storm and Roosters than in Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and not scoring experiments interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we'll definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm has a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man has posted $200,000 for drug charges.
A man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland got bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of the five men arrested last month by the federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht that came from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomer in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting together at the port during the morning and later met with them at the coffee shop Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential sentence of life for possession of cocaine of commercial quality, Maksimovice's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the cafe completely by chance and innocently.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan thought the Maksimovic would escape.
It has a clear link to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he said in the middle of the court.
He lied to the police about where he lived in the Crown case.
The mother and stepfather of Maksimovice jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that the deposit of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Apparently, their efforts themselves were insufficient because the accused did not appear in court, warned.
Maksimovic has been granted bail on condition that he surrenders both his Australian passport and his Serbian passport, reports daily to the police and follows a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged on to her online chat room, where he had lots of naughty photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found her phone missing and then found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She went through it and found disturbing news before alerting her mother.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then analytic computers found an address and discovered a "disturbing" search on the web using expressions to search for naughty pictures of children.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was to "put pedophiles on the Internet" before he "pretended to be a police officer and frightened them."
The Fiscal Representative Eilish Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court, "He said it's an addiction - he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer search, but he said he just wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he was doing it to lure them in.
He says he went crazy drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When a girl found messages on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw dirty pictures on her phone, and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, resident at Ward Road, Dundee, has pleaded guilty to bringing an action for the acceptance or provision of inappropriate images of children on June 14, last year, violated bail conditions on January 25 and failed to appear in court on March 24 of this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sex offenders because he can argue that in his act there was "no fundamental sexual undertext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October to report social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but he was held in custody before the hearing on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his sentence.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivered a bad speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tainted by the claims of opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats of killing, warning them of the booing of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Chairman of the Democratic Change Movement Club (MDC), Innocent Gones, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning that they would not prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is named 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and, as soon as they step out of Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that Morgan Tsvangirai's party is "concerned" about threats against Members.
Hewlett-Packard is about to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolishes between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of business services of the company.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the business of computers and printers from its faster growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and start in the fourth quarter, reported by HP.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and chairman of the board, who will be head of the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops to help businesses switch to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have an annual income statement from the company of more than $50 billion and "will focus on providing unrivalled integrated technological solutions" to companies.
The company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment, and whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed "Silicon Valley birthplace."
HP underwent a massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of America's largest technical firms, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialised company has better results.
Captain Mike Arsenal Artek says that teammates have to get behind the wounded Jack Wilsher in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also emphasized for Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason for him not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will surely miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next summer European championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilsher ended up strong last season after an ankle injury and then got back into his former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a career threat," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he'd sustained before.
This could be purely medically true, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he has played only 65 league games of Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for the Arsenal this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two clubs of the Premier League which lost the most days due to injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you return after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to spin his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Artek are likely to board.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out," says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite of the F-group, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 games after they maintained the "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium shook on Wednesday night with an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter.
That was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal learned from last season's League of Champions, when he capitulated against Monaco and remains far from the hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is tremendous," says Wenger.
It never happened to the arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar images in different shows is blatant, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever with regard to suicides among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Man, whose aim is to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of over 2000 high school students exhibiting symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of experiencing mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be achievable first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate answer is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, although we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial achievement is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker explained recently, money really doesn't buy better luck.
The beauty of "Friends" was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victim, the moment of watching football in comfortable seats, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stems from knowing that, yes, men can also relate to it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me:... "my role as a listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the programs that comes into my mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It emphasizes little moments in a man's friendship.
As for my assignment, the outsider's status on the phone helps people in moments of desperation, but long-term support must come from a greater proximity, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend, organized by Comedy Central, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk, where the interior will be completely reworked for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central station from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG wipe Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blais Matuidim and Edinburgh Cavani after scoring the goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut in the League of Masters and helped PSG beat the Malmo Swedish team on Tuesday.
Here's the news of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable victory of 2-0 against Malma at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after her debut in the League of Masters and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal with his head at 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for elimination rounds, but on improving their journey to the quarter finals, which they recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even though they gained three points, it was not the classic performance of the team Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahim was prodigal in front of the goal and later replaced him against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"The Champions League is not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve with the progress of the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahim returned after the injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team, which at home suffered a 2-2 tie with Bordeaux in League 1 this weekend, but was shrouded by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as the man who would move the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transition from Manchester United, which took place last month, and showed why, when he ran into Marco Verratti's pass for Malma's defense and with a beautiful finish, he sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to start a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, which defeated Celtic in the playoffs and got into this phase, joined with nine internationals in the basic lineup, and five defenders, and two retainers were a tough opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjice's missile, which just missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG took advantage of the attack with bad passes and miserable endings, which were not good even from Ibrahim, who could not fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he showed up much more appropriate when it came to preparing chances for his teammates, and it was from his pass when Di Maria sent a spin shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguay header sent behind the line already the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahim passed him after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all of Malma's ideas about the possibility that they could make a profit from the match, and only the excellent intervention of Wiland from a very close distance thwarted David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the alternating Ezekiel Lavezzi was not recognised at the end of the match.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, nor said: "Our last game in the League of Masters took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played the Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hat off for Paris.
It was a wonderful match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion in stock sales.
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, who was hit by a commodity price collapse, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares under his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the price of commodities, as China's slowdown in the economy is reducing demand and igniting sparks of destruction across the markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore's share price to the top of London's stock market in early morning shops.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the index FTSE 100, which opened up by 0.69 percent above.
Glencore revealed last week that selling shares worth $2.5 billion is part of a wider plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares worth 123 pence per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of, like, 1.3 billion shares at a total cost of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the extension of China's growth has reduced the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington on 25 September in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the President visited in November, was reported.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
"President Xi's visit is an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and encourages cooperation in resolving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the disagreements between the two states," adds the report.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN's September meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address the disputed problems, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis swept up the Schengen area.
The emergency flare detonated by Germany did not bring the European crew together, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote Le Figaro's French daily.
On Monday, the European Union decided to address the problem of refugees first: it will systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers once it has set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees by quota on the basis of quantities that are increasingly diverging from reality.
Six days after Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160 000 refugees, Member State interior ministers changed their priority.
Rather than caring for the final destination of refugees, it is necessary to filter out those who are arriving today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for the management of migration," highlighted in the text discussed by the ministers in Brussels on Monday.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds that it is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the tide of those seeking asylum in that country.
This makes it clear that there is no free movement in Europe without it.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday has already served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has come to this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under Schengen rules.
He sees it as a domino effect, but he sees it as a blind one.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is a reality of rigor.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified with fingerprints taken.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others of leaving camps on its shoulders where refugees would accumulate on its behalf.
Greece remains the real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as they have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they went through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and which is waiting for a new government, has put their hands in the air.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of the common concern now for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but it did not mention any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," the Union's Home Ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore about deploying the intervention teams of the European Frontex Border Control Agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its asylum reception capacity and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the final word of Athens.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting closer.
In any case, the new emergency situation of the 28-year-old has pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, already established by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about this.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was preserved on Monday in a text approved by a majority of twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is adjourned.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, an agreement already reached in June during the EU's hectic summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, of which allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who were killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also the woman who survived as the only one of the affected eight-member group.
Previous media reports said it was Polish.
About a 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with severe leg injury in the femur area.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly 40-year-olds.
"The rescue operation is over, as well as the bodies of the victims have been transported to Briancon to identify them," stated the prefect of the department of Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
The accident happened around noon in the mountain area of Pelvoux below the top of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 metres wide and about a metre high," noted the head of rescue workers Nicolas Colombani.
For an eight-man group, there was a huge amount of snow at a height of about 3900 metres.
The weather service didn't warn of adversity in the area today.
Perpishovský before the fight with Braga: Finally a true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský managed to pass through the pre-rounds of the European League to the base group during his premiere in the cups, and is now looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
Slovan will welcome the 2011 finalist Braga at the start of the main stage of the competition, and according to the coach he wants to impose his game style on her.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, every goal and every situation could have eliminated you on your way to the dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we collect, we can play our tactics, and we're not tied to a single double game.
"I am very looking forward to this and it is a true Europe, before it was only a qualification," said Trpishovský at the press conference.
He thinks of Braga as a top team.
It will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may be harder now than the fact that he doesn't have a name like that, but he does have a player in his cart who I think was scoring three goals for Manchester.
"It is an excellent unit at the level of the top teams," said Trpishovský.
But he doesn't see Braga as a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we also showed in the home competition and in the pre-rounds that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Supercup in Pilsen from 11 duels this season.
He believes that Liberec can force Braze's style, too.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, and it's uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They're playing 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"He is a very tough opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the field," said Trpishovský.
We studied our opponents a lot in the pre-rounds, which has helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted to our training.
"And we certainly do, although it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films take over the Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries this year entered their works into the competition of the 15th International Festival of Student Films in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which were sent by a committee of students and teachers to the finals, will be projected from 15 to 18 October at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said the spokesperson for the Jakub Charvat Festival.
Every year the festival has its special theme, which depends on the festival theme.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year's festive evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our attraction this year," said Charvat.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student work - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, in which, for example, the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda will sit.
The festival organizers, like every year, prepare an accompanying programme.
Wattic Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turboshansson band We fly?, playful band Grainy or for example Petra Hapková with recital Life on the Bar.
The festival will also host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first one will be brought by a graduate of the Sandy Film School and a holder of prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
On the meeting with visitors comes cameraman and documentarist Martin Czech, the silent film The Cameraman accompanied by his music by Gerhard Gruber and sand native Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný will baptize his new book 3 friends from town P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron saint of FAMO in Písek, who recently abandoned us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from around the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint links and a film trade," said the speaker.
The Pitching Forum, where students can meet film professionals, will certainly help to do this, to attend several job auditions at once and to get a job position.
The festival is connected with the creation of Private Higher Vocational School Film in Písek.
Her founders, married to Vladan and Miloň Terčová, organized their first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year of the year.
In the event of the bankruptcy of CK, the insurance companies are required to pay the full claims of the clients.
Insurance companies should pay their clients' claims in full in the event of the bankruptcy of a travel agency.
It was decided in the centre of the House when it approved the amended amendment to the Act on the Terms and Conditions of Business in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee according to the draft that is headed for the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay their clients' claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on the modification, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insurance for travel agencies against bankruptcy if the amendment is valid.
But travel agencies are also criticizing the proposal.
Because without insurance, they're either gonna have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development Karla Šlechtová (YES) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation were not euro-comfortable.
It drew attention to this year's decision by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, pointed out by the nobleman.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it can be implemented," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
According to him, the bank guarantee won't work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to terminate or move their activities abroad," said Kalousek.
A member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) did not agree with Kalousek's concerns on the basis of a survey between member CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.
The statement made by the insurance companies does not consider Okamura to be relevant, there is no official written statement to that effect.
They say they're finding out if the travel agencies will be involved, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the rival Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," says Fischer.
Her proposal to delete the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Even Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not come forward with the proposal to return the draft to committee due to an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip drew attention to travel agencies which he thought might threaten consumers.
The rapporteur of the draft Martin Berdych (YES), in view of the Constitutional Court's verdict, withdrew her proposal which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the claims would not cover the full risk.
There will be no proposed minimum four million insurance limit for travel agencies that offer tours by air, and one million for offices that sell bus tours, for example.
The border will remain at 30% of the planned sales from the sale of tours.
However, the insurance performance limit will have to be such that, in the event of the bankruptcy of a travel agent, it covers all customer requirements.
Even after the modifications, the standard provides that travel agencies will have to restate the tour organisation of the travel agency for the routes sold.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance undertakings before the contract is concluded, inter alia, data on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information on insurance undertakings.
Travel agencies will have to supply them each month with information on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of the tours sold, the amount of advances and sales for and vouchers for the tours.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil one of its legal obligations towards the insurance undertaking, it shall invite it to remedy it or to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of the customers.
The amendment is also intended to re-regulate the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its request, which it will always submit by the end of April for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, the financial plan of expenditure and the outlook for the next two years.
However, according to the association, the legislator did not consider what would happen if the insurance company terminated the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and clients who bought the trip before the cancellation of the insurance will lose it according to the association.
CK in this case will suffer a significant loss and may fail even though its management was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can deal with such a situation will be by suing the State for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and then we will only act as agencies in our market, said Vice-President of the Association Jan Papež.
Although the draft amendment also contains, according to him, a bank guarantee institute, but without thought, it cannot be implemented at all in practice, because the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in existing practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the two-year horizon, it will be necessary to rethink the whole law in the light of the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are now operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have ceased their activities.
The local travel agencies will sell annual tours worth about CZK 20 billion.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work towards improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after negotiations with German Earth premieres.
At the same time, it has again appealed to the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU, among the Member States of the 28.
We need to help more the countries where refugees leave, or where they stay after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will pursue dignified conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations could be such a signal.
"The Federal countries also support the German Government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis on European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the Regional Prime Minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, at the press conference, said that he expected real solidarity from all EU countries.
In the long term, the distribution of refugees in the EU is rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke have also spoken in favour of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start integrating foreigners faster, said the Prime Minister of Brandenburg.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees be used to integrate those who have a chance of getting asylum.
It will take more teachers to get refugees to do German.
This is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can be an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon plays the divinity in the movie
Matt Damon confronted Affroametic filmmaker Effie Brown during the discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO Greenlight project, the actor cast in the Brown series interrupted the need for alternative insights into black protagonists in the script.
"Speaking of diversity, you're doing it by casting a movie, not casting a show," says Damon.
Shocked, reacted disgruntled Brown with mistrust and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown have joined together with a well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will treat the character of Harmony," said Brown in the beginning.
The only black character who's a hooker who's being picked up by a white pimp.
The producer of the Dear White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off that their direction "might eventually give us something we don't want."
After the debate was broadcast, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at writing a video, "Matt Damon was jumping into the language of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is so white that it hurts."
Tweet has won over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 liks since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national effect and pressured law-makers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made references to the movement while presenting nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The newest leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the personality question of Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," said the manager.
Damon was recently reported on the list of entertainers, producers and media mogul who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the views of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior contest on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men fought their way to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated first in the set limit and became the first contestant to overcome the strenuous 4 sections in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero surpassed it by three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the newsletters E! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was recognised that he was still in shock from winning the main prize worth $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," said Isaac E! in response to my win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's gonna be like right now."
The executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten won no reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, money belongs to whoever finishes the track the fastest.
"If more contestants participate in the track, the winner will be the one with the best time," said Weed.
Although the profit of the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he has a grudge.
He's glad he got what he did.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife. "
Geoff said to me, "If there was anyone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will start shooting in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just walked right past Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the park.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers only narrowly averted their defeat when they beat Minessota with a close 5-4 result at Target Field Stadium in Tuesday's game.
The twins missed a chance to get close to the Houston Astros team and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which for them during the second half of the season was so elusive.
"Winning is always fun and no matter how," said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
The tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive entrance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1 / 3 hits and 3 rounds.
It was only his third good game of the last nine games.
"This year I want to end with convincing results," said Simon.
"It's hard to get into a fight when you're sitting on a bench a lot and that's why I want to get in the game."
Tiger Batter Victor Martinez has hit three times and made two rounds and his first download point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, in which he scored four times in the game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He put his foot down," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at practice, he was batting significantly better, and he managed to get it into the game."
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins got their best chance of getting back in the game.
Central Field Officer Byron Buxton got a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
The true fielder Aaron Hicks scored a point by setting a bat, and Simon spooked Brian Dozier before Blaine Hardy's left-handed swapped him.
Hardy knocked out his only rival Mauer, and he had the batter Miguel San in front of him, who hit the ball and ran two bases and left right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the bases and a draw chance in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send a third meta over two.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two bases this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit kept the ninth shift, Mauer got two points down, and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 score for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed man has eliminated Sano to three odds.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes' game.
Tigers got three rounds in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who entered the game after more than a month's pause due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly did not imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift I felt I was able to pitch better."
After resisting the first shift, Hughes dropped one point at the second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Two trips for the true fielder, J.D. Martinez, were brought in by Victor Martinez, who was the first to cross all bases.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was thrown when he tried to make it to third base.
The tigers added two points in the second inning when the pitcher James McCann and the fielder Anthony Gose got them two points, and then one point on the final table was a 3-0 score.
"That got us on our knees," said the Twins' Manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got him to the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up with no points in the third inning and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, got six hits and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, a true tiger pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007, will take care of him.
Sanchez, who's been on the list of wounded because of strained muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should be in the middle of the game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and board against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded for David Price's left pitcher, he has a 1-1 score after 4 games.
But he hasn't played since August 20th because of his muscle stretched out.
Tigers and Twins will play their third game together at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will be the Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to the wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping to the group whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should be involved in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the central leader of the group on deepening overall reform on the 16th meeting.
Promotion of opening in emerging reforms will give new impetus and vitality, also provide new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The leading group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the easing of border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, making statements.
The government will also release controls on the powers delegated to companies and make sure that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In order to open up a state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and provide them with better services," stated in the statement.
Moreover, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to optimisation of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary Region there may be a new bed section.
According to the Deputy Minister of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of the individual hospitals.
But there are also possibilities for extension of care in the region.
For example, in the surgical department, one-day surgery centres could be established, where surgery exercises would be performed according to the set-up, which do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals the day-to-day surgery workplace should be in, it is not yet clear.
In addition, a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technique for skin diseases could be developed for the skin department of Karlovy Vary Hospital.
The concept also recommended the formation of an apallic centre that would care for patients with brain problems who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthesiologic-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility at the Island Hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, is the beds of follow-up care, in particular the beds of the Long-Term Patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nedek is insufficient and should, above all, be closely linked to the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should act as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommended by the concept.
As he points out, the post-care beds are mostly missing from Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There you could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least in the Karlovy Vary Region, there are no social beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the Republic, so it could also serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's centre.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds to which European funding will be made available.
"These are beds which will be connected to the fields of superspecialised care and will form a space for the translation of patients after surgery, for example, after cardiothoracic, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.
