Petr Čech: Change at the last minute?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transition.
The next chance will come in winter.
Petr Čech, currently alternate goaltender Chelsea, is not sitting over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting in the Smichov NH Hotel, talking to Czech journalists, and is preparing with the Czech representative for the game rehearsal with the Americans, and then also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the goal of Chelsea, the Premier League takes precedence in the new season of Thibaut Courtois, the Czech Republic became an alternate in the London Club for the first time in ten years.
Some time ago, there was speculation that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Supercup in the matches with Atlétik in the opening of the season and failed to enter the league when he lost 2-4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about Paris SG's interest.
He dropped two reservations and two draws into the season of the French League, shot up St. Etienne 5-0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 balance sheet in the league so far and broke up with Lille in a friendly way 1-1.
There have been reports on the tabloid English sites today that the Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, Cheech's last-minute departure from Chelsea is not very likely.
Skybet put a 4-to-1 course on him.
Peter, is it possible for you to change your jersey within the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100% in football.
Maybe during the day there'll be an offer that won't go away.
What would an offer like that look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet what an offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
All parties would have to agree, above all, depending on Chelsea's position as to whether the club would deal with any offer or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new location?
That's not what I was thinking.
But there are a lot of players in this situation today, they're all out there at the representation meetings, and I'm sure a lot of transfers are gonna close today.
So it would certainly be feasible somehow.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
And you're not pushing to leave?
The situation where I didn't catch a new season in the first three games is new to me after 15 years of my career.
Anyway, there's no reason to panic, pack up, and leave.
I want to continue to compete for Chelsea's goalkeeper position, and it's up to the coach who he chooses to make the decisions he's making over the next few weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into consideration.
The sports aspect is of course essential to me, but I look at it from a personal point of view, which of course includes the needs of the family.
Is it possible that you would catch for another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

According to India's rapporteurs, it also hopes that both nations will agree to cooperate on defence issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old male after a motorcycle chase.
The motorbike was stopped after a maximum speed of 70 km / h, and drove into the bush to escape the police force.

George Webster accused of raping hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be brought to justice on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charges at the Supreme Court hearing in Glasgow.
He was supposed to rape a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry on 7 June 2013 in the county of Perthshire.
According to Webster, she was attacked while "she was unconscious, asleep and in no condition to give her consent."
In addition, Webster is being prosecuted for the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in the Scottish Highlands of May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the trial at the Edinburgh Supreme Court on November 17.
Restoring a very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have designed a law to protect union organizations as civil rights.
"According to the way trade unions work, middle-class jobs work," says Ellison, the democratic senator for Minnesota, who is the co-chair of the Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to introduce John Lewis, along with a model of occasional rights, a law that strengthens the status of employees.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal opportunity to avoid discrimination in trade union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-trade forces
Adapting the Labour Relations Act to allow all workers who face discrimination if they want to engage in trade unions, to sue the civil court - and to sue for damages or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other advocates are putting forward in the law is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that took place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country, with one breath, was promoting democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisors supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja was replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, including language, and openly recognised that "the right of employees to gather, to negotiate collectively and to act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisors encouraged the Germans to form a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realised that employees would need to organise and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly says: "The right to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Arrangements which restrict or seek to harm this right shall be abolished and measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose shall be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the draftsmen and the Roosevelt guarantee included "everyone has the right to create and enter into trade unions in order to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organise and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions did not reduce the nation's strength, but spread it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unsuspecting level.
Those who attack the union forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that raised America and made it a true promise to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could have shut down every abortion clinic in Louisiana.
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisiana law on Sunday, which lawyers believe would probably shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
The regulation enacted by the signature of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors may temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and in the meantime they must obtain this authorisation.
"The proposing party will be legally able to conduct its activities and in the meantime obtain permission," says Federal Judge John de Gravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution concerning the law.
The abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, and said that it would give doctors more time to obtain authorisation.
"Today's decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from the sneaky law to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Executive Director of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three out of five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs and also applied for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, with the Alabama and Mississippi courts declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked a federal judge on Friday.
Warriors for the rights of women to abortion, together with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have this authorisation places on doctors requirements that are not medically necessary.
Abortion opponents opposed measures aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights stated that only one abortion practitioner is authorised in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, said the group.
In response, the Louisiana authorities stated that they would not punish abortion doctors while waiting for a request to be granted.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, rural ovarian cancer kills more frequently
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of a tribute to their late mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% of the five years after diagnosis lived.
The head of research, Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, stated that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20% more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines can slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers have been tracking women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in elderly women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
For women in rural and remote areas of the state, about 20% more likely to die during the study than for women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynaecologists who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving medical services at a distance to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen the transport service that allows specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low, regardless of the geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, Elisha Naples's young mother from Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that, when today's young consumer generation reaches the "main age group of gardeners," the garden centres will lose up to £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent homes spend on their gardens, on average, 55% of the amount they spend on their own people.
As other factors threatening the industry, which makes an estimated £5 billion a year, it lists an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as a parking area and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Great London area, where the share of the homeowners fell from 61% to 43% in six years, one household accounts for the lowest expenditure on horticultural products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society stated that sublet housing or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief garden counselor for RHS, said, "The tenants are very popular with growing plants in pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year thanks to better weather, which came after the adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at his youth organization meeting, which reminds me most of all of Hitler Youth, rescued me with nuclear weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that he didn't care about their opinions, he gave us a lecture today on democracy.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both tense nationalism and that the inferior complex can transform into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to flow in the east differently than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of the wars for domination of Europe was long gone, in the east, on the contrary, they thought they had been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the grip of Nazi power, followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of strong leaders, the beating of journalists, the destruction of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians, are probably homesick of a time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
I guess Western politicians did it themselves, maybe little Vladimir was patted on his shoulders, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go, maybe they started underestimating him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made a mess at home, acted like he didn't really want to go anywhere, sharpening knives at home.
Now he's decided to take back the lost position.
He'll start slow, he'll have time.
He's probably the leader for life, so where would he be in a hurry?
He trampled on the Caucasus, now he's trampling on the Ukrainians, then it's the Dwarves of the Baltic.
They've been pinching a Russian bear in a fur coat long enough.
I'm sure China will notice that, too, which is getting a little too high, and it's definitely making its way to the far east.
And those Germans are pretty pissed off about Vladimir, too, how well they're doing, and we gave them a 45-year-old ass job.
Let's do a new Novorosiju in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base, and there's a lot of ours there, and as they're being oppressed by the dacho, they've already tried to tear down some of them.
Our veterans will remember how they were in Czechoslovakia until now.
Well, their Prime Minister Gospobin Sobotka, he's so soft, he can peel like an onion and eat their whole EU.
That would be so playful that they would jump at the great Russia.
They need to be reminded of their location.
And as detonators, we use our tribe members who live in their territory.
There's a lot of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed, they're simply oppressed, and we're not going to let that happen, we're going to protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, for what else is he born for?
After all, Europe is only good as a platform on which proud Ivan can dance his Cossacks.
Turkey has summoned an American diplomat for a spy report
Turkey's foreign minister called the highest ranking US diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the US charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that, according to the documents provided by the former analyst of the American National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for the US and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downgraded the importance of the report and declared that all major states are watching each other.
The older report, according to which Ankara was also targeted by the German intelligence service, gave the Turkish government a more indignant response.
The Game of Thrones series presented other tricks of the fourth row
The creators of the Game of Thrones are currently shooting episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the fourth-row tricks were created.
The most visible are computer modifications of the series environment and mass scene, where a bunch of soldiers become a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the City Hall in Calvia's Autonomous District to the Mallor State Prosecutor's Office.
The head of the Calvia Police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after charges filed by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after charges of corruption were brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street in which most bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's online newspaper, on Friday, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the city hall in Calvia's Autonomous Region to the prosecutor of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Office.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police in connection with the corruption charge and will be questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC quoted dissatisfied owners of nighttime businesses, according to which public authorities have serious effects on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," said one of the entrepreneurs in court.
Don't mess with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist appeared on YouTube, who provided oral sex to 24 men during a tour of bars.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to oversee drunks and troublemakers in the ranks of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, Playhouse, where there was an oral sex event, was forced to close for a year and pay a fine of EUR 55,000 ($73,000) along with the organizers of the Carnage bars tour.
The Magaluf tourist resort, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashion wave known as "balconing," in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide airport.
JARO brought the South of South Australia an ice surprise, came with heavy rain and a violent wind that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm rainfall is due in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall on Sunday during the night.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short showers associated with the storm and wind bursts, which began before eight o'clock in the evening and within about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of precipitation.
After several early doses of spring came after winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again on Monday to only 15.8 ° C (15.8 ° F).
Storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to land shortly after 7: 30, but it was hit by a change in speed or direction of wind and was forced to delay landing.
At that time, wind currents at Adelaide airport reached a speed of about 50 km / h on the ground.
The flight data showed that the plane had to drop out of the second landing and finally reached about 8: 40.
Subsequently, the delay caused additional flights to be delayed, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, the temperature in Adelaide will reach a maximum temperature of 16 ° C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending their summer in bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, rockets and mortars attacked their homes. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory recovers from fighting.
The beginning of the school brought to communities in the south of Israel marked attacks a feeling of joy and excitement, but signs of fighting are still evident.
In Ashdodo, a city in the south of the country, the staff of the school that was hit by the rocket removed the remains of the shrapnel from the wall and slowly expected the children to return.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, resident of the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart revealed that "it's a little strange" to go back to school at once.
"We've had some tough times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibuc, who is close to the Gaza border, to offer his support to the people.
Until last week's cease-fire ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and set off to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many of the inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, where a shot from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, hesitates to return.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study hard, and said, "We will provide you with education and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a time-unlimited peace last Tuesday.
While the cease-fire has led to an immediate end to the struggle, it has not solved key problems such as Hamas's demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel challenges these figures and estimates that at least half of the deaths were radicals, even though it has no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4 591 rockets and mortars during the fight against Israeli cities, especially in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, has taken more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel's attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have hidden in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into temporary shelter.
Because of tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of the ongoing struggles last week, school officials postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in the largest city of Gaza.
The willow at the reunion: I stand behind you.
And Lafatu's temperature is bothering him.
The Czech football team met today before noon in Prague before the Wednesday preparatory match with the USA and the following opening match of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Out of a 23-man cadre, Spartan assailant David Lafata has problems with his temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players, and David probably had a little bit of trouble.
But we want him to be here and be all right as soon as possible, "said Coach Pavel Vrba to the journalists.
"If it is two or three days, or tomorrow he will be fit, we will see that according to his condition, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some pain, but it's not like they can't train or take part in the game on Wednesday with the USA," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called Lukas Vách as the last player of the Spartan reserve.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, but other midfielders were also considered.
I made a decision based on the fact that Luke is a prospective player of 25 years.
It was very difficult to make decisions, but I stand by it, "said Vrba to Vach.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that nominations could still change in the event of health problems.
During the weekend, with great performance, Josef Šumal, Liberec, who gave a hat trick, for example, lit up.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown form.
Let's see how David Lafata is doing.
If it cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not say that I cannot finish the nomination of one of the players who were interested in the Czech League, "said Vrba.
This afternoon there will be a representative training in Strahov, on Tuesday a classic pre-game training before the US duel at Letna, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 8: 15 p.m., and the national team in it will seek a prime victory under Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he played two draws and once lost.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then scheduled on 9 September from 8: 45 p.m.
Pešice goes to Italy in the Netherlands
The willow is glad to have more time to train than the previous meetings.
It's an advantage if you have eight days of players and you can practice with them certain things that we haven't had that much time for before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting ready for the Netherlands as best we can, "Vrba praised himself.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally monitored by former temporary representative coach Josef Pesice.
He'll give us the information that's in the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have the game and we're gonna have the video and we're gonna talk about it.
A new coach comes to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes there will be, "said Vrba to bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, prices of flats in the winter period have increased most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices increased by 1.1% in August, reported by the Agency on Monday.
The increase resulted in an overall increase at June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase increased to 10.9%, more than twice in one year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
The research director of RP Data Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are in charge of the market.
RP Data figures show that Sydney's housing prices increased by 16.1% last year, while Melbourne's prices increased by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra, which damaged the State-mandated expenditure reduction, increased prices by only 1,4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties will increase for sale in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"In view of the continued high auction sales rate, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, the housing value is likely to increase even further over the next three months," he said.
My father never hugged me.
He never said "I love you" to me.
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked at the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is trying comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother died, Henry went through "thorough" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop that noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were adults - they'd go to a bar with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer jar or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading newspapers.
Recently Henry visited the foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked into what life had to be for him.
There's a little bit more light now, but it's still a dark, smoky, bleak labyrinth where the flames go off and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, and then you could hear him slowly singing for himself because he was washing the foundry.
When I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I started to respect him more.
Still, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
When my mom was sick and dying, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who she has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Will you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French, who he's been married to for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to take a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat carrots.
A change in the direction of taking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After he received recognition from the critic for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theatre.
It was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson Fence.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
The DJ spotted him on the stage parading someone, and he wrote about him in the talent show of New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black imitator / comedian on TV."
He learned as he walked.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make functional jokes, be a star and be on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as black, Henry and his comedy eventually performed in it for five years.
My family was already uncomfortable about that.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "years and years appreciated by the main product of British television," but was also "grotesque parody of black people."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters that also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began in 1984 and in the 1990's it was also known as the head chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For the next decade, he took ads, documents, TV shows, and roles in movies, but after his 2008 BBC show, LennyHenry.tv said, "So what are you gonna do now, Len, 'cause it kind of looks like you're stuck in one place or you're a little lost."
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really study him properly at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get into it if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words, and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented 20 lines from Othello's closing speech for the documentary, and he was already in on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"That's what it's about. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was hard, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which they didn't.
Soon he started playing in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was in the National Theater, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for the entertainment of the audience.
"The voice in my head said," Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes. "
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle this for me.
"You play, so stay in character."
Henry in Plotech at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the Plot lyric was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like a sign from God that says, "This is what you should be doing."
Of course, that's what she says in her voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Yet Henry remains the brain of a comedian - the whole time, our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and steps out of the role of an imitator.
I decided not to do stand-up because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can hit a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not as happy as I used to be.
I asked him if he'd ever organize another stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director, who helps to put the contours of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So, your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya began biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existing employees from the payroll.
According to the Government, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid even after leaving the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars per month (£700,000) on the salaries of non-existing employees and other abuses of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be spent on bank accounts even after the death of an employee or after leaving the administration, the BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, said.
All civil servants must attend the identification centres where their data will be biometrically recorded within the next two weeks, as stated in the Government statement.
He also says that anyone who does not show up without an apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By identifying actual public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of non-existing employees," said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey because of a suspicion of a "conspiracy against the government."
The police department hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in the December corruption investigation that focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for alleged organisation of a criminal gang and phone wiretap.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time the Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the actions of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseni Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for generations to come:
Not all schools had a traditional ceremony for September 1st.
Not in the whole of Ukraine is peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansk, attended by Jacesnik's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC found the boss for a hard time.
He carries with him the clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner conclave of the conservative party.
She has the experience of the front lines.
The career began at Bain and Co Consultant, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years she was the executive director of the Financial Times. She resigned when her younger colleague took up the highest position in Pearson's parent company.
They say her severance was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the government.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
Corporations turn in two directions: inside the top layer of the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership, but also out to the public in times of unrest when things don't work out.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires thorough reform.
But what director would risk coming into a company as complicated as the Chinese dynasty, breaking it down and taking his own job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrinking - its power, its finances - and its status review.
With the expansion of competition and the new technology calling into question the old security, the immediate negotiations on the BBC licence fee are in great danger.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in something that is certainly the largest media business in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production amounts to 96% of households, each costing only 40 pence a day.
Moreover, BBC popularity is clearly rising: 53% of supporters, compared to 31% ten years ago.
The models for using BBC services have changed: Today I can see the headlines on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can see the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing headmaster - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve an offensive tweet.
Tweet from Texas's official Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry, published on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of authority.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was posted in Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous one.
A tweet that hasn't been authorized has left my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I withdrew it," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unflattering, humorous picture of Prosecutor Travis County Rosemary Lehberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which led Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
On the tweet label, it said, "I don't always drive with a blood alcohol level three times higher than the limit allowed... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry for calling me responsible."
I'm the most drunk democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and he called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked a case-overseer to dismiss the charges, because the use of laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the State's Public Interest Defense Fund, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in Texas, after Lehberg refused to resign.
The rejection raised a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it becomes famous.
After he finished fifth in his party committee in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done with a tweet with his own photo running near the lake, and the words, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is back to normal.
One of London's most prominent developers warned that the housing market in South East England had "returned" to its normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about credit bubbles led the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for the demanding clients of Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to a normal level of transactions." He adds that it provides a "stable environment for operation."
London's housing market went well during the fall, because buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the data of the cadastral office, prices in the city jumped 18.5% last year alone, thus far outlining the average of 6.7% in England and all over Wales.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student housing rose by about a fifth last year and reached £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, they have not been so attractive to foreign buyers of London's real estate in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk about the possible "housing tax" that politicians came up with before the parliamentary elections next May.
Last week, London's real estate agency Foxtons warned that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter lending rules, would also slow down the growth rate of the market for both real estate and price sales during the second half of the year.
On Monday, the Bank of England's new data showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages in July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of rising prices of London real estate for 2015 to 3%, based on the fact that home prices have already started to decline.
According to the real estate agency, WA Ellis, meanwhile, in London's most expensive neighborhoods, like Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, decreased by a quarter each year.
Yet the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, because it increased the cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location remained the same, and thanks to that, forward sales remained the same."
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, prior to the annual meeting of Pidgley, it said that it was anticipated that Berkeley's annual revenues would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley shares stopped at 23,96 pounds on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
The hacker posted pictures of Jennifer Lawrence naked on the Internet.
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th Cen Academy.
The photos of Oscar's holder Jennifer Lawrence escaped the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of other hundreds of startup actresses.
A spokesperson for the "Hunger Games" movie star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "obvious privacy violation."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker received photos that were originally posted on the 4chan Image Sharing Server, allegedly through a gap in the Apple iCloud Internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim versus the rest of the world" Winston also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took in the privacy of our home are happy with each other," wrote Winston on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were real. On Twitter, she said, "These alleged naked photos of me are CODVRH, people."
It's better to cut it loose. * purposeful pun *.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs were genuine.
An extraordinary example of Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposed like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him he was too serious, complicated, violent, isolated, and maybe a little irritating.
And then she shook his hand.
You let it happen.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was an early love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of his lonely boredom and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon was a fragile beauty with a wild hair mane and a flying heart from a village on the northern island that was even more distant and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a moist but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes seeped, there were dead spiders in the vans, slugs slimming on the windows, as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled giant cabbage heads.
The house looked like a cottage of children's stories, terrifying and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for Man Booker Prize 2014.
A closer selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, inadvertently tuning in the public station, which supplied the region with pleasant music and soothing news, reminding him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to with closed blinds.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they didn't play songs like that on the radio anymore.
They weren't forbidden - really forbidden was nothing - they just weren't played.
They helped them get into desuetud, just like the word desuetudo itself.
People's taste has done what the rules and positions of the law would never do, and like people in books, they choose memoirs in which a poor man becomes rich, a cook, and love novels, so in music, ballads are chosen.
Kavern was torn down by the day, and he started playing the imaginary piano, and in a rude, comical voice, he sang the serenade of Aillino's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, and he automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
Father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny back then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn has never heard one.
Even jazz, even if it wasn't outlawed, they weren't playing.
The improv went out of style.
There was only room in life for one "if."
When the melodies started playing, people wanted to know exactly where they were going to end up.
Same with humor.
His invisibility got on people's nerves.
And jazz was humor expressed in song.
Even though he hadn't heard from Sammy Davis Junior in ten years, he knew Kevern jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she couldn't remember a time when popular singers weren't black.
Also without laws or coercion.
A lawful society is one in which every part of it with gratitude - with gratitude of those who were happily spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean origin were fit for entertainment and athletics by temperament and constitution, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for not having a family without a working phone.
The Poles that were left were plumbers, the Greeks that were left were washing dishes.
Those of the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while what was happening was what happened, where they were afraid they would blame them for putting them in the fire, actually worried that the fire was going to spend them next time - they opened restaurants, where they were selling llamneh and smoking water pipes, not paying attention to each other, and they were slowly eating them off.
To everyone according to their talents.
Since she was only listening to the ballads, Ailinn had a hard time understanding how the dirty words Kavern had just sung to her could create music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really dirty," said Kevern.
Maybe just for people with big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could have escaped from behind the soundproof leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence again.
She thought he was weird.
"He thought she was funny," he said.
She unbelievably shook her head and shrouded Kevern's view.
In the whole wide world, all you could see was the mess of her raven hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you think so," she said in doubt.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly feet.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles right now," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got out of the deck chair, knocked down the radio and spilled the underwine.
Elderberry wine, so it wasn't the drinking.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm sick of being a jerk," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes the moment she stood against him.
She thought she was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living on a cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was the same as here in the basics.
The same wide and icy ocean splintered on them.
The same deranged men, after what they had become, even more touchy and cranky than their ancestors, smugglers and spooks, rooting angrily from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who dares to refuse or laugh at them.
Jerk?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First cuddle her - cuddle her became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote to faint balads about the love that the radio breathed - first anoint her, then hit her.
In Kevern's opinion, too cultured, because cuddling itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon inversely suggested he leave.
He got out of the chair like an old man.
She felt upset herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from the upstairs window - a man caught up to what he had done himself.
Adam leaving the garden, thinking.
Her heart fell for him and all the men in general, no matter how many beat her up.
A man turned away from her, shoulders hanging, ashamed, defeated, all fighting left him - why did she feel she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment until today that she had seen it before?
Ailinn Solomon, alone again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Offnow, a non-statutory public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate violent acts in areas where it was reduced or directly stopped, most expected if enough money and energy were spent to remove it.
"A lot has been done and a lot still has to be done," she wrote, "in order to calm down the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the uprooted, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of the church towers rising above the hedges of human kindness, historically appeared."
Some things, however, are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh over sentimental balads, devour unfortunate stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality is held as stubbornly as in urban conurbations, but the evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance occurs at home, in the workplace, roads and even in sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery," said her superior.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her head down.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme once again held up her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I do not ask therefore," said Rabinowitz, "that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unprejudiced societies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is absolutely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment the way you've shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced towards the Church - the things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as expressing natural power and energy.
Always talking about what happened, if it did happen, as if it had happened, yesterday, preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
Behind his head, on the light board, there was a pink flash of the recommendation that Offnow broadcast to the world for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, make a deal, apologize.
Talking is better than not talking, the song word is better than writing, but there's nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," said Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure her superior was finished, "and I no longer claim that the wound did not heal as we believe it was healed.
My concern, first of all, is that if we do not draw attention to this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened when it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the fingertips.
That was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when steps that may have been taken and may not have been taken by your grandparents, you describe them as errors.
You go too far in saying that they were ventilating their "anger" and "distrust" on "others."
I shouldn't remind anyone, if I were you, that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we're not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "we," and there was no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we are honest with each other," Esme took courage, "no one is without blame.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Fair or not, what's done is done.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to blame, there are no things that should be fixed, even if the remedy is appropriate and maybe.
But what is the past but to learn from it -
The past exists to make us forget about it.
If there's anything I can say -
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged the fingertips.
"I will take your message into account," he said and released it.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hit the pavement in a way that the passers described as "brutal and ferocious."
Coincidences happen.
The army of the Lesotho Kingdom claims that there is no coup - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Lesotho Kingdom denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government, claiming that they were acting against the police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Masera.
After he said he was being threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family left for the neighboring South Africa.
The military spokesman Major Ntele Ntoi said that it was not really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the Kingdom of Lesotha's leadership of defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were several groups in the ranks of the police planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make a mess in the country," said the Voice of America.
A spokesman for the South African government, Clayson Monyela, said that military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one claimed to have seized government power by force, the actions of the Lesotho defense forces seem to bear signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials of the Lesotho Kingdom said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that, in his opinion, he is under attack because of his efforts to combat corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended Parliament's session due to internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He claimed that despite the opposite claims, his actions did not undermine the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month minimum
According to a closely monitored survey in the euro area in August, production growth slowed to 13 months minimum.
The final index of euro area purchasing managers (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have been cut, and the growing tensions between the EU and Russia have damaged the factories due to Ukraine.
The figures come from the Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US have been doing during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect, which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers, is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist of Markit.
The production of PMI of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, has fallen to an 11-month minimum of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
Signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring, "said Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add oil to the fire to analysts expecting to implement other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI has increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist at the IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing you can say about the inventory of shopping managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Eurozone producers currently have a very complex life, because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has proven to have affected trade - particularly consumer confidence, which is likely to result in some orders being postponed or even cancelled, especially expensive ones.
He stated that "even more likely," it seems that the ECB will eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were taken hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the suffering that took three days and shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We returned to Beslan to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at the school.
Exactly ten years after the horrifying occupation of the school in Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, the surviving heroes warned of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to tragedy has brought together the East and the West, which has led to negotiations and the future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, southern Russia, to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at the school.
We found amazing young people who resisted misfortune, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live in them.
What's their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is over.
A girl trying to crawl back into a ruined school gym
It was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, only in his underwear trying to crawl back into the bombed-out school gym after the bomb exploded in it.
Confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother Larissa, who is now 40.
There was concern that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
I had pieces of shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said resolutely.
"It just happened to me, and it can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and my future classmate from the Gapoeva Juice class were killed there.
We used to play together when we were kids and imagine going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten the capture, but the memories fade a little every year.
I'm glad so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we got from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from repeating itself.
A boy who escaped from the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia children school starts at seven years old) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At that time, a seven-year-old said, "Mom told me if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him out there, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was stumbling to freedom and lying in a hospital with an injured leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the extinct newspaper News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared winner Bernardo's Children.
"The horror returns every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell the memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But today, I can play computer games that shoot at, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could pick out anything I wanted at the toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffers just as much because of the war as he and his friends have suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for everyone who has to go through this horror," says Damir, who took part in a volunteer activity in the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work for the police someday, and I hope I get accepted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says, "They killed 37 kids from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no kids out there screaming and running, and the silence lasted for months.
He remembers his trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her award-winning foundation and for the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember seeing her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir wanting borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children will be killed, too.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir's grown up and he's a nice and quiet kid, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to think about it, but he's very close to six classmates and he goes to the gym from time to time and they light candles.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes he lay on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes he lay there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
Damir is 17 today, he's taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was sure for a few hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw that hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember screaming," Damir, run, run!, "but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes on, unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photo was taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan.
Comfort: Survivors from Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, on the right today Grigory
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, there was fear embedded in his bloody face.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed her older son Vladimir to college.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists invaded the yard, so my little boy stayed there for three days alone," she remembered.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's getting harder to think about and talk about.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some of the moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: The photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was implanted as a statue (right)
I remember that day Grigory was so excited to go to school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Grigory crying in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at that picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that because of that picture, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says, "The important thing is that this doesn't happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still under investigation, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing accident in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what the cause was?
This world is in for something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, then how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing to such pain.
To forget a little bit, he needs decades.
It had an effect on my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, when it comes to September 1st, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogori Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
Miracle: Gregorij Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was underway, he was trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it was yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
I'm older now, and they say that kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that's not true.
"I went to a psychologist in 2006, and it made me feel a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I passed out.
I will never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sit in this well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photograph taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge, and I bring it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee that I hurt, but I'm walking normally.
But I still couldn't get on for my health and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, like I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including my medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My next favorite is animals, so I got on the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows."
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about this.
It's not something that kids should know about, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "The pain will always be here.
He's inside, and he's getting worse with the anniversary coming up.
I'll take part in the reminder ceremony.
I know Grigory won't go.
It has to be even stronger for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he keeps carrying on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had multiple surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say 50% of the time, he's overcome the horrors, but you can't get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and loved.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it pains me to lose the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost popped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what happens in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were a friendly country, so how did we get to fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them away as far away as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who was taken to the safety of a special task force
Saved: Alyona Tskaevu is carried to a secure Russian special task force (left).
Now she's ten (to the right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world gasped for breath when a Russian police officer carried little Alyon in his arms from Beslan captivity.
The terrorists released her, but they kept her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister of Kristina and Brother Makhar in captivity at the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and she and her new wife Svetlana have a little girl named Kristina after a dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown up to be a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said, "It's a big happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is a great father, and he wants to keep the kids away from memories that he reminds of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in shooting or underwater shooting, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a few cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
In addition, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you will be taking.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you do that, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by purchasing and evaluating digital cameras in normal and watertight design.
Take a few shots - a lot of them don't come out.
Compact cameras have LCD to help you compose photos, but outdoorers don't.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater will be hard to see and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different exposure variance, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper submersion of light, it declines considerably.
If possible, stay close to the surface while shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you can see.
Get close to the subject being photographed.
That's excellent advice if you're taking pictures on land, but it's even more important underwater because of a lighter light.
This is particularly important if you film with an outdoor camera: such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you have to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality was able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving the sick from pain caused by both disease and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnoses and illnesses, treated patients in the overwhelming majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who suffered.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He was dealing with flu symptoms and found himself impatient, and Juliet's wife involved in remorse.
He said, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet went away on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague of mine did a chest X-ray.
One two weeks before, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or the lining of his lungs.
For most types of cancer, it's hard to determine what caused it.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smoking.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, asbestos exposure - a structural fibrous material previously referred to as "miraculous," but it is now known to be deadly dangerous.
It wasn't hard for most of us to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbest, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as depositors, builders, carpenters and shipyards.
The toxin used in industry in another era today seems difficult to be cause for concern.
But such complacency is not in place.
As it turns out, a mesothelioma epidemic is culminating in Britain today.
The number of deaths of mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths related to mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the UK
The reason why we are only now experiencing its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not only concern veterans of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we shop.
Thus, mesothelioma does not respect the social class, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged bastion from London's department stores to public schools is not a shelter.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals we should be treated in are the storage sites of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put down the insulation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years on practice," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question that he was able to partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were at the Guy's Hospital practice and who then manifested mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
It's not usual to survive with this diagnosis for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will suffer from the same disease?"
According to the leading British expert on the mesothelioma of Professor Julian Pete, the best guess is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90,000 people die.
Most of them currently have no idea they're going to die this way.
Asbest mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at files from the archives of the courts, to which the disabled often turn and require compensation, it shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that it negligently exposed asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was the flagship company, a shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M & S.
He's got two kids today who are in their 20s.
"Before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed he would have anything to do with me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given to him because of his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most often in buildings today it is possible to find chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO still regard it as a "great health risk" that can cause death.
It is dangerous but brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that "there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]."
Employee Marsk & Spencer was exhibited at a flagship shop in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A significant part of this exposure is due to "normal use and gearing 'of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not suspect that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report according to which service elevators and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee rooms are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be violated by something as harmless as "strong air flow."
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace be given a "positive medical certificate," it now counts on the need for one million pounds and several years of work to ensure that Parliament is thoroughly examined, that electricity is modernised and asbestos removed, and that Members, rather than on the green benches in Westminster, will be sitting in the premises of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Centre after the 2015 elections.
Goddard's report states that "the presence of asbestos does not comply with several regulations."
It is impossible to tell if this discrepancy will cost lives.
Everyone can wait now.
One person who has never been able to determine when asbestos exposure occurred is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven," he says, "but in my case, I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009 when he was overcome by something like chills.
He was 45, he was at night, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly I was shaking.
It came at the same time.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't driving home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
In the end, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent out of his lungs for analysis.
Still, they didn't make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he'd practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came into the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he was in direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of the lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much, "he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year's, "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started seeing the Macmillan charity nurses, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now starting to develop disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have risk professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated tubes in hospitals were located in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, members of staff who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement canteens (like often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where they could save patients' lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbest is being removed to this day.
The pupils built Bunsen kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and councils due to its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students were building Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos mat.
There was a website dealing with asbestos in schools.
Harmless things such as floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes normally contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s when the garden house was demolished.
So be careful how you break down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes you a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I can't concentrate on what I'm doing.
I've been in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things to do was to go from being a doctor to being a patient.
As a myriad of patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor," How much time do I have left? "
I've been told 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna see another Christmas.
That's it. "
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbest consists of tiny fibres.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
The asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and may cause cell mutations.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos most likely during hospital practice.
The asbestos needles are entering the lung tissue, says Treasure, and "breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
It's been invasive since the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not work as much.
The effectiveness of the operation, for example, is being discussed in a heated way.
Some say it would be worth a shot.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer "does not respond much to chemotherapy," which "has some effect," but does not.
"Sometimes there's someone who survives lung cancer," Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and advisor to the equally disabled.
When they called, he was happy to say, "Hello, you've reached the cancer center."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
The disease was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemo that would last four months, and would probably only prolong his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson was "able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they checked me out," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a requisition and have to approve his payment.
In order to get to the best treatment available, the issue of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments eventually inevitably fail, many patients face another financial concern - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan at Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we are dealing with the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't "a full settlement," because Lawson couldn't prove definitively that mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, the spokesperson for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminated basement area was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
To blame exposure of fatal asbestos on one company or place of work - usually decades after this - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces have changed owners or failed.
Insurance records are missing.
And those who now oppose the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this, important new legislation was adopted this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The Act created a $350 million financial reserve, which is paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally give them as compensation - about £120,000.
300 successfully executed applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks that £350 million is "good work."
"It is an agreement drawn up by insurance companies," he says, and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they had not taken the time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to get rid of the former employer and sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, rapid action was necessary.
"People suffer too much and need help now," said Penning in December last year during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott has been in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The operation followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski boasts survival rates of up to 40% of patients for five years.
It made Abbott stronger.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you surrender, your condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August he completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The checkups showed no signs of disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
I had a few spots in my chest [cancer].
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It's not life-threatening.
He's into it.
Abbott's had six cycles of chemo again.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his system.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think of practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how a boiler alarm works.
When you get the bad news, you get negative.
You have to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden, a lot of people started calling.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face this kind of conversation.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not lightened by hope or even by a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and in the end it also brought to Stephen Jay Gould) an unfortunate certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma does not threaten life."

World production is held at two million tonnes a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the numerous debates on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this will trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists have started to organise and prepare themselves just hours after this announcement.
China's People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We were not surprised, but we were angry," said legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of China's decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership elections would cause "chaos."
Since Britain returned Hong Kong's administration to China in 1997, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards, citizens will be able to vote for executive power.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but it also makes it clear that China's leaders are holding firm the nomination process of a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be eligible.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of the largest and most watched protests in Hong Kong over several years.
The majority of pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are behind the occupation of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not grant them universal voting rights.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Okupace movement gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong government's seat.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would start waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details; they clearly wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of the Centre only as a final step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice left.
We regret to announce that all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted today, and the Centre's occupation is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, strengthening the protection of government headquarters on Sunday, and deploying police and barricades.
According to many Hong Kong residents, the inciting of unrest is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticise the Central Occupation Movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - Hong Kong's lifeboat.
"The protest he talks about could cause much greater economic damage, depending on how many people take part and for how long," says Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could harm investment.
China's state media has also come up with reports in recent days that have been portrayed by democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents driven by the West.
In the summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which involved 780 000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
A pre-trial agitator?
The League of Jihlava is named according to the political movement
Some 1,600 amateur athletes play a small soccer game in Vysočina region.
And their top competition is now called Together for the Jihlug League.
It was named after one movement that goes into the October municipal elections.
In addition, the ten-way on his candidate is the boss of a small football in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," said Cloud.
The situation around the major league of small football has already been addressed by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
Little soccer got around a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, too, is about the sum of hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the process of a small football is not contrary to the law or to the guidelines of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to adapt the rules on grant and subsidy allocation, "said Radek Tulis, the spokesperson for the Municipality.
Taking subsidies from the city while expressing as small-scale support in elections to one political party, I don't think that's possible anymore.
A similar request from politicians has not yet been made for high school "big" football.
For example, ČSSD Regional Championship, ODS Division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and all that?
I wouldn't go for it.
On the contrary, I would like to be approached by corporate sponsors, "said the chairman of the Miroslav Vrzáček Regional Football Union.
The head of the little football team won't let another party and the movement into the league name
According to players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own resort with six playgrounds, cloakrooms and bathroom facilities.
"For example, the playground on the hills is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ondrej Lape from Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
In my opinion, however, there will be a senseless resort for skateboarders, which is about fifty in Jihlava, "said Mrák.
The primary of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small soccer team uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupa, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are going to modernise or build sports sites at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think a great deal of progress has been made for the little soccer player over the last few years, "he added.
Other political parties in league names will not appear according to Jan Mráka.
We have restrictions.
If someone from one branch enters our partnership, we don't put the other one there, "he explained.
"A political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the City Council Sports Commission Karel Voldan.
"But whether or not voters will assess whether Mr Mráka is using Little Kick Jihlava and city subsidies for political purposes," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jet planes
We are pleased to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 vehicles.
Stewart also said that the service has its own security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the country in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important freshman) this year students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesperson for the company said that since the services have only just started, they have no reservations yet, but he added: "Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that although students pay annual tuition of £9,000, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF programme is exactly the right way to achieve this.
But the national student union criticised the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students who are going to university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before they spend thousands of pounds on something as simple as coming to college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
The feminists, after the events in Ferguson, oppose the racism and behaviour of the police.
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson in Missouri killed an unarmed young man.
The present waiting for the funeral with their hands up chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, about the shooting of an unarmed young man named Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in the Internet discussions of white feminists.
She found that, when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex over race.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which attracted national press attention, Perez noticed that the white woman's reaction was 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of a black woman soon after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with headings such as "thinking of white women over Ferguson" or "feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
But according to Perez, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege on such a level," she said.
People felt they had to express themselves to what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis that we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially dedicated that they had to draw attention to it.
According to an English professor at Ohio State University, Coritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light problems that African-American women have to face every day and that are not perceived as "female questions" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories about my partner's life on Facebook, and it gets 150 liks from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about colored people being trapped in their own country, it's deafening silence.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
According to her, blacks could not afford the luxury of dividing these problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women today combine race and gender issues in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor lecturing women's questions and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of white female rape, "said Hattery.
To justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to Hattery's dissension between white women and black women, he came when a sufferer like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or black people - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet the cards on the right to vote for women and the right to target black people later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women acquired voting rights in 1920, it took them ten years to organize against lynching at the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was created 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the rise in the reaction of white feminists to the issues that have brought about in Ferguson - the issue of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "catch up" with the issues that black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child just as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" said Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what that means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column of Guardian demanding that white Americans protest more strongly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but yet similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions on race, which differ greatly in opinion polls - will seek change," said Steinem.
Despite Steinem's intersectional feminism, which includes race and gender issues, some people are confused by her comments on race issues in America.
An expert from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, the author of the book "Who Stole Feminism?," said for She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments to Ferguson's parties are facing criticism that she had already provoked.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper, which was supposed to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic, it triggered a lot of feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The police 'relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes at the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police arrested nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors this year in the southwest of the country, the issue of reform of immigration laws has been raised again - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, a women-mobilizing organisation for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to be able to pose the question as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," says Mercado.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them are in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a resonance in women's organizations," she said.
Pigs' residence in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was released, a pig rested on it in the living room.
A one-room separate house, which is for sale for £120,000, is on a private road in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room in which the pig rests with his head on the sofa.
The Connells real estate office said the pig in the photo was the pet of the owners.
"The photo was found there by mistake, which is why it was already removed," said the office spokesperson.
In the property information, Connells described the former prayer house as a "unique separate one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house has given rise to interest in social networks, where some have asked whether the pig is included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A search is under way for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, a lucky man taking $1.1 million from his lottery campaign Saturday night home.
The Harvey franchises had a second time in the distribution of luck in five years, the last time in November 2009 was a one million dollar prize.
But the lucky winner has yet to sign up.
The owner of the store, Steve Forward, said the whole town in the southwest of Perth is talking about winning.
It's a theme, and everyone's upset.
We thought a win like that was a touch.
Eight winners in West Australia split one win last month, completing a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and only a few weeks earlier a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey Millionaire is the 59th lottery winner in West Australia this year, winning $85 million in total.
Deutsche Bahn trains don't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages.
In the press release, the GDL identified the protest as a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose time away from rush hour.
At the time of the strike, the GDL takes account of many people returning from the weekend by rail only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people commuting during the day, "said the union on Monday morning in a press release to declare a strike.
"Our first strike should mainly affect freight transport, less passengers," added GDL.
The DB has not yet published an official response to the announcement of strikes.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international rail links, including with the Czech Republic.
The union is demanding a five percent increase in driver's wages and a two-hour reduction in working time per week.
At present, the average salary of drivers varies between 36 000 and 46 000 euros (998 000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year depending on the years worked.
The drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
The DB refuses to accept wage increases when working time is reduced.
They stress that the wage evaluation of drivers must develop in the same way as for other railway personnel, for which the DB does not foresee the shortening of the working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at the Barum Rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand-new, so I didn't think anything like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower rate to the garage where the mechanics would replace it?
If we go straight there, yes.
But we still had two more ersettes, and I couldn't.
It's got a high temperature, and the risk of the car burning was huge.
I can't afford that.
At full speed, you passed five speed tests.
How did they make you feel?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the vintage.
Everything was caused by the fact that the car we piked for more than half a year to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You started it so you could actually think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we could really win.
Work didn't go to waste.
On the other hand, the result we might have thought of did not appear.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You weren't the only one from the top who left early for the first time.
It also got out of the foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Were you surprised that so many favorites dropped out?
Yes.
It was a shame, especially for the audience, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromir Tarabus, whose car you were planning, has been on the top for a long time.
But he paid for flying off the track and picking up almost two minutes of manko.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the victories.
I mean, he was doing the first two times.
But even Mira confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He was going really fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum Rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular rally player?
Not at the moment, I'm sure.
Last year, I said Barumka was my last race, and I still failed.
I've decided to go again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I think I'll do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking me if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team's moving on.
Next week, we'll go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't do much damage here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Honza Sýkora Fabia for this race.
Mira and I will have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to get things ready for next year.
Is there anything you can say?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally belonged to the World Cup, the fifth place you reached your peak in the series.
Don't you find it tempting to try the lines there again?
It's not.
Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not get a medical certificate of incapacity for work, which serves as evidence to the organization that you cannot perform your duties for medical reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of your absence.
Consequently, although the agreement was agreed that the days would be registered as holidays, the agreement was only made orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent in writing to draw leave, in practice this procedure has proved to be effective.
If there is only an oral agreement, you have no confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take up leave, as in your case, may be regarded as a long-term, unexcused absence as a reason for immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute with the employer, you are thus lacking proof of proof.
However, your employment with you has not been cancelled according to § 53, only you have given the dates listed in the balance sheet as an unexcused absence.
An unexcused absence in the balance sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to receive physical unemployment insurance), but it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We advise you to visit the doctor again and to have it confirmed in writing that there was indeed an accident that made you unable to work (this is not so-called "disability," it is only a medical document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and the early notification by the employer or the request of written consent to the drawing of leave.
It avoids any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track
Back to the track ended up for Tony Stewart just behind half the race track of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence for the second time after his right front tire broke in the 172nd round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart drove a damaged car into the garage, didn't tell the reporters, and left.
The head of his team, Chad Johnston, said that car number 14 was disappointed, but he's going to be focusing on a race in Richmond, Virginia, next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we do better there.
Stewart hit the fence for the first time in a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repair of the right side of his car.
"We had hoped for a good finish in today's race," said Johnston and said, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and he needed to win either a race in Atlanta or a follow-up race in Richmond to catch up on the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident involving the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who ran into Stewart during the race.
Authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
So far, no decision has been made as to whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion had a warm cheer before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, worked his way up to 10th and then even fourth place.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and hit Stewart, sending both cars to the fence.
Stewart went on, but he withdrew to 21st place.
Prague has selected a new taxi station manager, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedures for the new taxi station manager.
For 103 parking spaces, it will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million a year.
Until recently, she collected CZK 150,000 per year for the same seats for taxi drivers.
Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09) informed about it.
In the past, the city used to draw lots when choosing managers.
The winner then obtained a lease for a flat-rate amount of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently decided.
"A year after the termination of the original lease contracts and the opening of the tender procedures, it has been shown that the new rental system is far more advantageous and fairer for Prague," says the councilman.
The most expensive spot is on Perštín
The highest price was offered by the people interested in the site on Na Perstín Street.
They pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for places in front of the Municipal House or in Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi stations were adopted by the councilmen in autumn 2012 and the original lease contracts were terminated in the summer of last year.
The selection procedures took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 posts.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released the whole thing every time, creating practically the second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo in.
Unbelievable stench!
Our well in the cellar has always provided enough beautiful fragrant water.
And that wasn't like a professional thing to do, my grandfather gouged it out with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was just three skits and all, like everything else in the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then, we thought the water didn't smell good.
We were wondering if something had fallen.
In the place where the pump went through, it was possible in a bit of bad luck, the plate was not quite there, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, you couldn't see anything in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we've improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky package on the floor with some bones on it.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little bit further.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
By the ceiling, in places where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, there were remnants of fish!
And heavy-duty!
Our basement is also quirky.
Some would say Grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floors are just stifled sand, only the ceiling is bruised.
They put ships in the first place.
And wheels.
And beach chairs.
A door with wide gaps was usually open, as someone walked in there all the time.
At the ceiling several of the already mentioned vents.
Without a net, so there are normally birds flying in and building nests on the beams.
It's useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to go off, and it did.
Now, of course, even the luft didn't help.
The whole basement smelled bad.
So we cleaned the whole basement, too.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We threw away stuff that was around: planks, heraklito boards, that sort of thing.
Our remote cottage was greeted by passers-by disinfectant.
We were wondering, who put those disgusting leftovers in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It's hard to come to our house for snacks.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
If he didn't put the disgusting stuff in the vent?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, he's got that.
We decided to watch the basement and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, just for washing and washing until the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water out of a forest well is nothing I've wanted to do for a long time.
One day, we heard the terrible, anxious bark of our bitch.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The rose was jumping over her and squealing like crazy.
My mom called her out 'cause she thought Reza dug the trash hose out of the sink.
But suddenly, the hose got partially tangled up in the ball and partially rolled over.
There was a hissing on the balcony.
Reza had a hysteric attack.
We ran down.
She was going to swallow a giant toad, long over three feet, and fat as a bull, and Reza was going to stop her from doing it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the narco saw the outcry of our entire family, she probably said we should eat it when we're so hungry, and she went through the vents of the basement elegantly.
We went after her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind a well.
By the way, we recorded another stinking package on her record.
By the smell, I think it's a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a little tricky.
And we locked the basement in the middle of the day.
That he...
We went out, and there we lay down in one vents.
We haven't waited long.
The well's been messed up.
First, there was a flat head with a yellow moon on his neck.
Then she swung all over the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and started to recharge inside.
The fired employee took revenge, bought a laptop for the company, and sold it.
A disgruntled employee bought a computer from the company after he was released and then sold it.
He managed to spend the money he got before the police were arrested.
During a short period of time, the man purchased in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the notebooks after the takeover to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," said Chief Commissioner of the Shumper Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for fraud was revenge on the employer for his release and also the profit of the money.
"In his interrogation, he claimed to have used the money for loan payments," said Brückner.
Police also found out that a fraud is a pathological player who has been repeatedly treated in a psychiatric institution.
The money could also end up in winning machines or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we haven't found any money with him," said the Commissioner.
A con man who's been convicted of theft before is now threatening to stay in prison for a year to five years.
The police have not yet communicated whether the penalty is also to the bazaars who bought and sold underpriced laptops.
"It is true that they were taking over brand-new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar has been charged yet.
Come on, just a little more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared some changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route that led the target to the Band-Aid instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race along with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally greet our readers at the booth where we took pictures and made videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I accepted the role of personal conductor.
Together with my friend Katya, just before the start, we politely placed ourselves at the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted our friends who passed us through the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
Couple of minions to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown, and start!
Screams of gladness, but instead of a quick start, there was a beating to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurements and run at an hour of ten.
We are intertwining with a yellow snake of runners, who, like Katya, are running their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky gives a view of Vyšehrad almost to a cheesy touch.
The pulsating flesh stretching along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running around.
On the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has how much power.
A light hill in Palacky Square forces many runners to slow down or go into walking.
I see a police escort just before the play at the Theatre, and there is an incredible pace for Vitek Pavlišta.
I can hear the oddly stuffy sigh of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to give me a high five, but right before that, my leg gets twisted, and our hands just miss.
Running down the Theatre Street gives you a chance to relax and breathe.
There are places in front of us where the views will blow my mind.
The turn on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are almost alone.
There's a moment of truth behind the first refreshment.
When crossing the Katya road, he chokes on the curb and shows off the jump.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm running a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues along Goat Lane, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, while there is no such rush at this stage of the race, but it is still necessary to keep an eye on the area.
I don't know yet that the concept of the narrowest place gets its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate, tourists and friends of other runners encourage us frentically.
I'm trying to applaud everyone who offers a hand, and I'm advising Katya, because ten applause with fans is like half an energy bar.
It's really working, we're accelerating again, and even though we've fallen through a lot, now the fighter ride has started.
We're getting ahead of dozens of runners when I miss someone particularly tired, trying to cheer them up with a few words, "Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it!"
We're not getting ahead of ourselves at the last snack shop, we're speeding up.
So far, we've been running for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line is gonna hurt, but it really needs to be done.
The sun has already set and the ending day is symbolically slowly ending the race.
Last exit to the bridge, turn around, and just a straight line to the finish.
The pace we're running at is astonishing. Where is it coming from in that girl?
"Come on, we're going under 13, we're working!" I'm calling.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
One hour 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can we do?
Coach has set the limit for an hour 20.
So seven minutes below the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katy's legs are looming, helping her to the railing, where she's resting for a while.
You can see the exhaustion, but you can also see the happiness of a well-done performance.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of target space.
Euphoria doesn't let us think about the pressure room in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that Goat Lane wasn't the closest place.
That's right behind the finish line of the bandage, which under the strain of nearly 10,000 runners is stuffed to burst.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's no place for them.
I, too, lose my head after a while, wondering if those beautiful views and a more interesting route were worth what was happening at the finish line.
I know from experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the whole Prague centre for all transport, add to this, there is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere of the Yellow Spa was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators stepped it on every metre of the track.
Unfortunately, when running through the historical centre, obstacles that cannot be removed must be taken into account, but I do not consider the objective of a mass race in a place that is enclosed by a wall on one side and on the other side by a river to be the best solution.
If I say the race ended with a goal run, I'd say it was a very good one.
I was a little concerned about the health of the participants, but everything turned out okay.
Let us know if you liked the route and how you feel about the finish line.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria attended a national protest rally before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their call for the reintroduction of the original working conditions that have recently changed.
There are also higher salaries on the list of requirements to be discussed with the Interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
Peacekeepers have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for the month and demanding a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the unions of prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, they informed the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"Negotiations are still ongoing," said BNR Head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service Rosen Zhelyakkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Union Workers' Organisations at the Ministry of the Interior will also join the protests of the prison service staff.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them?
Physicists usually don't write bestsellers, but Brian Green at Columbia University did a good job in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the Houski problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today - an attempt to unify two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that, in the case of searching for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between the two key theories (for now our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws), so they solve the basic problem with the idea that it is worth telling even to the laymen.
In addition, Greene has dealt with complex material so fresh and engaging that he cannot blame him for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he fixed his "mistake" for the most part in two other books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book getting old faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that it will be a little more alive in this area in the coming years (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go "full throttle"), and so it is a good time to enter Green's nonviolent open door of the modern physics world.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can surely sound foolish, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Yet it is specific and totally acceptable.
To understand that, let us turn our eyes from the universe as a whole for a moment to something more earthly, namely a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine pulling a 100-metre garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from a half-kilometer distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance, you can easily detect a long, horizontal hose, but if you don't have a sharp edge, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Given your long distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
If someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you will answer them only with one message: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a mile away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has thickness.
If we magnify everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle irrigating the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in / against the direction of movement of clockwise hands," i.e. around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You are beginning to understand that in order to determine the position of a small ant you need to enter two numbers: how far away is from the end of the hose and where is on the ring of the radiating hose.
This reflects the fact that the hose surface is two-dimensional (note that experts notice that this chapter focuses purely on the failure theory of strings.
The non-fault aspects are discussed in Chapter 12 and Chapter 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and rolled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easy to see.
The size of the radiant hose circumference is short, "rolled" and is less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
That they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, coiled and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not exactly work hard to uncover the "coiled" dimension of the irradiating thickness of the hose.
All you had to do was take the binoculars to help.
But if the hose had been thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would have discovered a coiled dimension only with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he published an astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza's radical assertion justified that the additional dimension provided an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory could be absorbed into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this observation of Kaluza goes together with the obvious fact that we see precisely three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly pronounced and specified by Swedish mathematician Oscar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, large and slightly visible three dimensions that we are aware of at any moment.
But analogous to the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, tightly rolled into a space so tiny that they have remained hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
In order to get a clearer idea of the nature of Kaluza's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a little while longer.
Imagine drawing a rather dense series of circles on the circumference of the hose.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With binoculars, we will now reveal the coiled dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together with four dimensional dimensions.
It's hard to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let us note the illustration on Fig. 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we increase the view of the geometry of the space as we increased the surface of the hose.
Each following level represents a huge increase in space geometry from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement) if they are rolled into a small space enough; this explains that we have not seen them directly yet.
The square network depicts commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle of a new, tiny and coiled dimension.
Just like thread loops in densely woven carpet, even these circles exist in every place of the usual size - we only drew them into the intersection of the square network because of the illustration.
The background of Figure 4 illustrates the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in standard scales such as meters, shown by the side of a small square in a square network.
In each of the pictures below, we will focus on the small area of the previous image; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, when we move on our way to the microscopic properties of space geometry further - to the fourth level of enlargement in Figure 3 - we see suddenly a new one, in the shape of a circle of a rolled dimension, similar to strings of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions in the same way as the hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn a circular dimension only on some regularly placed points.
Figure 4 summarises Kaluzo and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity to the hose is obvious, although there are also important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we drew only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
What's even more important is that we're talking about the space geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular-rolled dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - is much harder than observing apparent, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our most modern enlargement tools.
Most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a round bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of the three normal large dimensions.
It is the dimension of the other three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and perpendicular) each other.
A small ant could move in all four dimensions and we would need four figures to determine its position, in addition to the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we count time, then data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for an e-book is 149, - CZK.
To our surprise, we find that, although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzo and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The latest technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a metre.
We can barely observe smaller, coiled dimensions.
In 1926 Klein combined Klein's original Kaluza idea with several ideas of just-born quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be approximately one of Planck's lengths, a size far beyond the resolution capability of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzo-Klein theory.
Wohn Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: Episode 5
The whole meaning of the "twelfth" consists of a 12-stroke harmonious form that you can easily repeat.
Whoever stumbles in the music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola aka Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating a puppeteer and a puppet conductor whose Facebook profile can be monitored here, he has been living like a graphic artist since he graduated 20 years ago.
He's a guitarist for the band Wohnut, which I'm afraid you can't get out of.
The guitarist is like his father, like Brother Matej, the leader of the Wohnout.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can think of anything, you just apply it to the harmonious model of the twelfth," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch what Honza can do with a 12-year-old harmony on two strings and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you add the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for the tune change, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza goes back to the pentatonic and you try to hook her up with 12.
So practice her honestly.
As best as you can read in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, admits Hradec Dvořák
We take the point, and we're happy for it.
The first half had more chances we, the second landlord, "said the attacker, who scored this time from the penalty kick.
You weren't nervous when you played him, but he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I wasn't particularly aware of it, although on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You settled the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the penalty goal out of the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the beginning, we were passive, it turned into a horn, and then a penalty.
After that, you got up, and you were a better team for the first half, with more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal we scored until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game after her, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But I guess it's also true that the landlords said something about their game during the break, maybe they weren't very happy with it.
You only scored your opponent for the first time on the field, while you may not have scored a goal at home yet.
Why is it so different?
I don't think it's that different, but it's up to us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Pilsen, that's a different category.
Four games you were waiting for a goal, didn't you worry that after the last game it might be similar?
I don't think so, but we are, of course, glad that since the last game, we don't have to listen to the talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which is not yet for a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a mile away crater.
Lava flying to the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the glacier Vatnajökull, flows through an underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the underground lava tunnel mentioned.
This fact now concerns scientists the most...
The situation remains constant for now.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) continues to fly out of the crack approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the initial estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but only 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
But scientists fear that a lava tunnel could be opened in places beneath the ice.
If this were to happen, with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the river Jökulsa and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption, there is a strong smell of sulphur, clouds of steam and gases rising from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also much more gas, "says the vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no wind in the morning.
The footprints of the sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
The orange level (second highest) for Bárðarbunga and yellow (third) for Askju applies to air operations.
Heaven over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
Air day in Cheb.
On the machine Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced the flying acrobat Peggy Walentine, who climbed from the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the double flyer and also between the wings.
There is only dependent on the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb took place for the fifth time this year and again the organizers managed to prepare several interesting aircraft pieces.
The premiere was performed not only by the "walking on wings" of the German acrobat Peggy Walentin at the oldest Czech airport, but also by the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his radiant cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originate in the United States.
After World War I, so many former war pilots were trying to get ahead.
But because of a large number of fatal injuries, he was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the schedule of flight days.
Peggy gets out of the cockpit on the upper wing after launch.
That's where he does his exercises.
At the end of the performance, he moves to the space between the wings of the aeroplane where his show continues, "described Luděk Matìček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
Boeing Stearman 75 E pilot is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was at the top of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was the famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter fighter came to the surface with Grippens Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so-called numbers).
Air fans in the Czech Republic could see such a routine for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated to everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with the aircraft from 1945.
He was made during the war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was placed in the army reserve.
Since 1963, he has worked in the civilian sphere.
Even as a race plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiště.
There is also another pearl of the Cheb Air Day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was no way to miss the massive machine at the airport.
His polished aluminum cover shone far away.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French Air Force won admiration.
A small transport plane jumped behind the abandoned Turbol and a part of the German delegation arrived from Hofu on an air day.
German neighbors showed up in Cheb with reconstructed aircraft as 18T or a three-man formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: A dramatic return to the camera!
The parents' worries were exchanged by Lucie Borhy at least for work tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde host obviously doesn't know any of this.
She was very good at hosting TV news, as if she hadn't stopped for two months at all!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended six weeks ago, where women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
Lucie, however, will not be shown regularly in TV Nova's main news session.
The regular return is due in a month, according to information about Blesk.cz.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy went back on the TV screen, and it was a hit.
A year's exposure in Prague?
The hall would sell out, planning a bachelor party Jagr
It would be dignified if something like this was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands up to it, "he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the fascinating Nagan team met again.
Even the players who participated in the gold hat trick.
Players would like that, wouldn't they?
Absolutely.
It would simply be a good thing to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, you can find one or two days during the tournament when it's completely off and where you can mix a match like that.
We'll tell Gum (Jiří Šlegr) or Yogi Šcherban (organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take charge of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
Well, if I'm gonna fly in...
You don't want to play in representation.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow alter your decision?
The presentation and exhibition games are two different things and the representation is crucial performance.
One thing is, people would love to see me there, but the performance is crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who can do it and not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagan reunion, anyway?
Just the meeting with the players was great.
You brought back stories and you had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
The most important thing, however, was an honor to Ivan Hink.
And it's good to remind the history of our hockey game that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimir Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Can you still remember your first representation match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we boarded in one threesome.
For all of us, it was the first representation start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, there's no way to say it.
In Jihlava he caught Dominik Hasek after a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
I'll never be surprised by Hasan on the ice.
I wanted to get back at him with the criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticized Jágra for the reasons he decided to quit the representation). He caught just fine.
Even the Rotten did a great job.
He was with me one night to practice, and there was a hole in him.
And now he's caught a great one.
First the US and then the Netherlands, the football players begin their qualifications
On Monday morning, prominent guests were gathered at the Smíchov NH Hotel.
People could see Peter Czech goaltender from Chelsea, representative coach Pavel Vrba...
And over there, the figure in the black baseball cap, that's Tomas Rosický!
Arsenal's backup and the captain of the representation arrived at a meeting around 11: 30 between the last two.
We have a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't look forward to it? "he said, when he had already presented himself to the press in the representative kit.
Czech Representation Programme
Monday 1 September: start of the reunion, first training
Tuesday 2. September: Training open for fans (18: 30, Letná) Author (20: 00)
Wednesday 3. September Czech - USA (20: 15, Letná)
Tuesday 9. September Czech - Netherlands (20: 45, Letná) end of the reunion
The fans can support Rosický and spol. before Wednesday's match against the USA (20: 15).
The presentation opened Tuesday's training for them, which starts at 6: 30 p.m. at Letná.
And it will be followed by a book signing, which will not be missed by Rosický or the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, this national team reunion will be calmer.
Which is praised by Coach Vrba, who was complaining about a lot of social events in the spring.
Finally, we are going to do what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have a player together for eight days.
We will have time to rehearse things that so far have not been so much time, "Vrba praised himself, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech football representation will be accompanied by the Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The presentation has three matches under Vrba, all preparatory.
She tied to Norway and Finland 2: 2 and lost to Austria 1: 2.
However, these results were not yet important.
It's only now.
By fighting the Netherlands, the qualification for the 2016 European Championship will start.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could also make it through the overhaul against the US.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful, "Vrba agreed.
The only player in the 23-member nomination who has medical problems is the assailant David Lafata.
His temperature's bothering him.
If he hadn't recovered in time for Wednesday's game against the United States, Coach Vrba would have called in another assailant.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how, after a misdiagnosis, she thought she was going to die for many years.
After she was diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking she only had a few years left to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity of CMT UK stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among CMT people, because very little is known about the disease.
Approximately 23 000 people in the United Kingdom are believed to be suffering from CMT, which may show symptoms in motor skills such as muscle weakness, clumsy gait and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in the affected, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very bad prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be bound to a wheelchair, and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who are now 51, says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell every day and everything took longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I used to walk and run. "
When Rodgers was 13 and she was after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and she looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and I wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When they answered my question, I was in shock, I completely panicked.
I thought by the time I turned 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my powers.
I was all alone, and I was planning a funeral. "
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk didn't deteriorate as much as she expected, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous to life. "
After passing several genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The charity organisation CMT UK has launched a month of information on CMT to draw attention to this disease.
Entrepreneurs in Washington: With the turnover of the economy, taxes are raised
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxation of companies in the country, accelerating the recovery of the economy last year, has increased slightly, and firms in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia, together for the fiscal year 2013, have spent $27,6 billion in government and local cash, which is 3.8% higher than the $26,6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year, and this was the third growth year in a row after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to a study carried out by Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local contributions, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenues, 56%, are from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has the lowest tax income in the business.
Researchers claim that the majority of tax revenue growth is due to an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which increased property taxes this year by 3.7% after three consecutive years, with an increase of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York, and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini paid over $10 billion last year on state and local property taxes, which, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012, represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not drive up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of the taxation of companies.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax accounts for almost half of the state and local taxes.
"In Maryland he owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organisations that don't pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax income from business cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to data, business income also appears to be increasing.
Companies in this region have published a corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, which has increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took out one billion dollars in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow as quickly in these three places.
The rate of growth in D.C. was at national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the tax increase below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has 6% of all three districts (all of which have the same tax) of the lowest corporate income taxation.
The rate of taxation of companies in Maryland is 8,25%, while the DC average remains relatively high, to 9,975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the US Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a more generally favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't review the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the company tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
In 2017, if the State continues to meet the income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to up to 3%.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, so they pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation for cost increases by raising prices, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20% to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and the nationwide increase in trade tax is likely to continue next year, while the total tax revenue from sales to state and local governments will increase to 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may be lagging behind others, because reducing state spending takes its toll on the labour market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's Shears will be the boss of Europe
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin has called for a meeting on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in South-East Ukraine, where government forces have been facing pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support given by the West to the war of the Ukrainian army in the East of Ukraine is, in his view, contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kiev, so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has earned the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, along with the diplomats, is to propose the form of further affirmation of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, deciding on the EU summit tonight.
This was told to journalists by the permanent chairman of the meetings of the member states of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for a shift in the form of sanctions are due on Monday.
Tusk will be the new Union President.
Van Rompuy will replace in December
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected head of the European Council, the so-called President of the Union, which manages the summit of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy.
In charge of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian, who will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
The assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it is not discussed.
Help an incurable and long-term patient leave life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, it is not legally possible.
Nevertheless, the comments of the doctors who addressed the LN show that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The heaviest chapter of neurology, says the doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of approximately three hundred people, 21 patients undergoing experimental treatment with stem cells in Motola, Prague.
We definitely don't know if it's going to be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out, "says Radim Mazanec, a motor neurologist.
It's about knowing the CIA's handwriting, needing war, writing Huml about shooting down flight MH17.
MEP for CSSSD Stanislav Huml is clear on who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that the "severe sanctions that have been imposed with regard to the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead have been deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the legislature, the CIA's handwriting is also known.
Unfulfilled promises.
The elections are coming, and the parties are again offering the impossible.
No more homeless people on the streets, no more parking for every family, no more cableway over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: parties promise the impossible.
Even now, with the forthcoming municipal elections, politicians are racing to see who likes voters more.
Server Lidovky.cz has selected impossible promises from the present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovakians landed at Dunkerque.
The fierce siege has begun.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Liška has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
In the end, the British Party complied and classified this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SUMMARY: Pilsen leads the league in front of the Prague "S," Liberec declared Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading by a point in front of the two Prague "S" s.
Changes at the head of the table caused the defeat of Slavia 1: 2 in Mladá Bloslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the home league, and two Lafat strikes defeated Jablonec.
The record prize in the year was credited to Liberec, who shot up the Ostrava Baník 6-0.
62,000 people on volleyball?
Poles say yes
The introduction of the MS volleyball team in Warsaw brought a record.
At the football stadium under a closed roof, 62,000 spectators watched the home win smooth over Serbia.
The tickets were sold out in 100 minutes.
How do you survive coming back from vacation?
Take your time and get some sleep.
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Getting used to coming back from a sunny beach or cottage to a normal working pace can be a nuisance for many.
It may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are good tips on how to deal with a changed situation: take your time and enjoy a good night's sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "Fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she doesn't lose hope that an 80-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
Fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services according to which she had a cardiac arrest on the Yorkwill endoscopy in the Upper East Side, as indicated by the source.
Physicians deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
Reactions have not kept themselves waiting for long, including incredible support on the Internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is twisted subtitles
That the media is twisting reality with subtitles, unfortunately, there is no news.
I know the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, more concise is the word sucks.
This applies in particular to the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headline "Israel Attacked Gaza" is quite common.
It is only in the text that you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the fired missiles from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
That's when the headline "Both sides broke the truce."
Does the journalist community realise that it directly contributes to the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not just there)?
It hasn't been 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived the Shoo.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the words "Jewish swine" and similar indivisiveness, I was struck off.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews, they were meant to be destroyed by the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as "the watchdogs of democracy."
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your people.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decided to destroy the Czech nation and wipe the Czech Republic off the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also recognize one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live on the territory of the state of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them, why don't they go to "their own," like Gaza, and answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top health care (I have seen with my own eyes how the top private hospital Hadassa, which is funded from sponsorship gifts of Jews from all over the world, is usually attended by Arabs and is naturally treated there).
Hamas is attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even indirectly in subtitles.
Inform Hamas's practices, its exploitation of humans as human shields.
Inform that Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations.
In nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been booming with humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, but for which Gaza's administrators are not paying, and they are even upset that sometimes electricity supplies are being cut off at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in building underground tunnels to be penetrated by suicide bombers in Israel, but, for example, by building residential houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion of Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying a video streaming service of Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement brought a surprise not because no one expected anyone to buy Twitch, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitter to Google seemed a billion-dollar deal, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago by Justin.tv, was set to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online games on it - in the words of Business Insider "YouTube for Live Transferred Playing."
Interface Twitch.
On YouTube are already popular videos "Let's play," the kind where the sage (mostly older) give the game processing of the Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube is coming up with a lot of twitch when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube's Twitch buyers didn't excite anyone, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have at our disposal is the statement by CEO of Twitch Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because he believes in our society, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster."
The next mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say that they prefer to do sport rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about playing instead of just watching it.
It's one thing to look over your friend's shoulder at 3: 00 a.m., as Resident Evil plays, and it's another thing to watch a stranger get 20 hits in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from a player's perspective, so looking at their record without you being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games in which the Bannisters of our electronic time complete the game in record time are fun.
But if someone isn't a master of acting or humor, his Twitch channel probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth on top of internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to take advantage of this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch getting mixed up in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as if it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something every firm would like to attract: a bunch of young men who want advertisers.
As the director of Twitter Shear, Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games" said, and the media do not seem reluctant, even as - swallowing - viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on "Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that contravenes their religion, they often put us before the question: who will you trust?
Alleged God's Word, or the Word of Man?
It's as if human examination is completely meaningless compared to the authority they imagine to have their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to the word of God, they refer to the myths of God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator with a purpose, then he's the one who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and he must be the one who invented genetic patterns that match it, and he must be the one who supplied the next series of evidence that points exclusively to an evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And it was the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy doctrine of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not by gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictate of angels, but those texts were written by none other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would only be one such book, the only scripture holy.
It would be known all over the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors would not be able to compete with such a work.
And people wouldn't have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would show deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would constantly inspire every reader to the unity of a common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into increasingly separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each claiming God's guidance in some way, regardless of continued dissension and separation in every way.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Baha'u'llah Kitab-i-Akdas, the Zarathuštr Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and the "revealed word of the only true God," and the believers of each of them say that the others are on the wrong path.
The only logical explanation is that, to some extent, everyone is astray.
None of the above-mentioned books has any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence, and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I'm not saying I proved that the Bible is reliable and historical accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also aposology (advocacy) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdity and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfilment of prophecies - and that each may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written with human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudices bound by politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more of a mutual comment.
We must point out once again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish between four different sources for Pentateuch alone, i.e. the five "Moses" books, and they do not attribute the authorship to Moses, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents have been filtered at the same time, and they are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as its believers think.
Dead Sea scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrian, Buddhism, Hinduism, Helenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by doceti and ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in some kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as luciferians were scattered and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these modifications relates to King Ugarita, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young mystic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule him, and Ba'al Zebul, the "Lord of the Mountain" turned Belzebub into the "Lord of the Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and deceptively amended for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century A.D. in a series of comitology decisions at the Nikaja Assembly.
The four gospel were accepted and sixteen others were rejected by simply raising their hands, as if the reality of a matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers back then.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter at the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
And so the canon core evolved from the edge of the primordial church.
So the council simply accepted as an gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among uneducated masses at that time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by books that were approved.
Among the rejected items, we will find writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God's word refer us to books that are just the words of some people and / or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the true author of this random mix of legends, parables and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not by too many enlightenment, rather the contrary!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, no matter what it is almost from beginning to end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to spray blood on someone, it would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants, and bats are birds, and whales are fish, and pi is an integer.
These people believed that if they showed a pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book didn't know that.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, then it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain absolutely nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, theft, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why is that?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't even have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worship creation instead of creator."
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself, and even insist that disprove their supposedly "holy" books somehow disprove God as such.
Not their version of God, but all their versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They can't accept that God could exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they can't separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship human-made compilation as if these books were God himself because they think they're his word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly "unchanging word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately amended and twisted by mere mistaken people.

The assailant at Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of whom died.
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, violently entered the primary school building this morning and attacked around 10: 30 local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed died later in the hospital.
Chen then killed himself by jumping from a height, said New China with reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in accordance with government policy.

"We had to sit with our hands behind your back, which luckily no longer awaits you, you are already free people," said Zeman to the children.
His wife then gave the first-graders a puzzle as a gift.
President Milos Zeman and his wife in first grade elementary school in Lany.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started a new school year at a private sports school in Litvinov.
"This year I want to link Czech education to Czech sport," one of the reasons why he went north on his first school day.
The school management approached him a while ago at a hockey game in Litvinov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the start of the school year," added the Minister.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litvinov.
The first class of 115 thousand first graders started this year.
A total of over 850 000 children will attend primary school and more than 405 000 students will be educated in secondary schools, estimated by the Ministry of Education.

Apple iCloud allegedly succumbed to hackers, got naked pictures of celebrities in public.
Screen shot with a list of leaked files
So far, an anonymous 4chan server user publishes both naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, alerted the American Mashable.com. server
Allegedly, it was accessed by disabled users through the automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads on Apple servers by unauthorized access to user accounts.
Apple has yet to comment on the problem.
Some celebrities reject images as falsified, but have already admitted several affected authenticity images.
These include the actress Jennifer Lawrence, known in the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games series or Mary Elizabeth Winston, who played, for example, in Die Hard 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
Apparently, American magazines showed interest in the footage, but according to the reports on 4chan, the hacker wants the community's money instead.
According to The Next Web server, it's probably a real weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on GitHub to obtain passwords to user accounts through gross force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before publishing this tool.
For preventive reasons, iCloud users should change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The escape of nude celebrity images is a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are provided many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, upload sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encode the files before upload.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic back-up of photos from your phone so that it takes place only on wi-fi and after connection to the charger.
This will allow you to move sensitive images "to safety" in a timely manner, and in particular you will have space to delete failed images, so they will not take up space in an online storage site.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altaire Valášek in PDF format to readers HN and IHNED.cz.
Smart way to save money on a college script
Since the price of a university script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the upcoming student of the second year came up with a clever way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of lending books from high-school classmates offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
"A book for calculations, which normally costs $180, I got for a semester for ten and for chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College, Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have different ways of managing these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is lending textbooks, which allows students to use a semester book often at a significant discount than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 bookshops in campus areas, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
The research in the branch shows that around a quarter of the books in the university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Stores in the University Books.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books may be up to a third lower on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy it at Chegg.com, in a retail store specializing in textbooks, for a new one for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind other people's notes or wear and destroy, the teaching texts are the right option.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com paid 42 cents for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisitions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The new one was sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls proposes that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working in seminars.
If so, the older edition can be sold at a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, the popular alternative for buying used books is also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Lending
Lending textbooks is also worth considering, if you treat them well, you don't forget to return them and you don't need them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 a semester.
Get to know the terms of the store where you borrow the book, including penalty for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic licence valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lodges "Calculus" for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon board the Pepperdine Law School, recommends you follow ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book over the Internet, make sure it's really in stock, says Gault.
He's convinced himself.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso from the end of the war in the well.
That well is just outside St. George's Church.
We uncovered the vegetation around and started to pull out an age-old load - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay floor, we hit the barrel, "Radomil Novák described.
We pulled it out, cleared it, and found out it was a torso attack German rifle used by SS troops.
The discovery is supposed to be unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were made at the end of the war.
And there were about 300,000 of them, "added Novák.
All wooden construction goods have decomposed over time, which is why it is useless.
But her body is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There's an explanation.
Maybe it was dumped by people who needed to get rid of a weapon used by SS troops, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were dumping guns in the woods, "they think the finders.
The rifle was the only thing the enthusiasts of the Rainbow Jesenice Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there could have been a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the dig work, carefully touched the mud so as not to cause any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Novák approached.
The find ends up in a museum depository in a castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech Republic
Exclusive interview with Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev / Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take this... I have a call from Donetsk," he apologized, like, eight times during an exclusive interview with Upstaalne.cz, Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the Military Prisoner Liberation Centre there.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
In any such interruption, it was not possible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"This will be it - go there," ended one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again devoted to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a back-up general, a former fighter pilot and an active member of the anti-government protests on Majdan.
Yesterday - when we were talking - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is carried out 24 hours a day.
Last but not least: You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their numbers by 30.
There could be a lot more of them, of course.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated the captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not yet.
But I do know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured compatriots and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What advice do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian volunteer battalions and the separatists capture them, they will shoot them without mercy, just like any other stranger.
Separatists think these men are hired mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and, among them, perhaps, the Czech Republic - they will put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side is also acting like a state in war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it's already crossed a hundred men.
A long time ago, we stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we only freed them... from the war if they choose to continue fighting.
Saviors are doctors in the war, surgeons, but we certainly are not.
That's it.
And every day there's more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be a trade.
Sometimes a mere human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: Rumor has it that in a few months you have gained great authority with the pro-Russian separatists and even trust... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you build the respect of both warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "mad general with steel balls."
I'm not offended.
And it may even describe the nature of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers' Corps, I've gained some authority before.
I'm never smart, I'm not cheating, and I'm always a man of my word.
No matter what happens, I act honestly and I'm telling the truth.
Even if it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk government, it is very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they torture and kill them.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even being captured in a prisoner exchange... this job could be the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know about?
... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners in interrogation.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information about the fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Nor is there any indication that the Ukrainian army is committing such a thing.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't and I don't want to give numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motifs of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but there are veterans from Afghanistan.
They are seeking autonomy and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that is what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
Separatists are fed up with oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents - to the death.
As we say, they ate them up to their throats.
The same dreams and desires people showed on Maidan, by the way.
And now I'm speculating: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the other hand, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be great and the other to be small.
But this sentence of mine already contains an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how do you find one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I'm unarmed, showing soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of the 200 or 300 meters in the aim or in the optical scope.
Those faces of people pointing at me, I can always see... and they can pull the trigger on their guns at any time.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, it's just like a little gubernia in a big Russian empire.
In any case, he talks about this constantly and considers Ukraine to be some sort of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist, according to him.
At the same time, he is an irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters, on the Ukrainian television debate show, you have described your Prime Minister Arseni Jacenek as a weak, clueless and tired "leader," who would do the best to leave quickly.
I get scared at least five times every time I walk three hundred yards.
So why should I hide the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak Prime Minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a stake in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Jacinuchi "the rabbit."
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of Ukrainians, from which fear or respect and authority would come.
His behavior directly replicates the behavior of a rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, to beg him, to play his schemes with him, to threaten to give the job... he has to run the country, to manage it, and to protect it in times of war.
At the risk of the country, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on weeping emotions.
He's the first of the Ministers of Ukraine.
And Yaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything all the time.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the sales
Expendable 3 Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the $90 million budget in the US, and Sin City: A woman for whom I would murder only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first weekend, and also films for children like How to train a dragon 2 were disappointing for cinemas.
According to an article by Robbie Collin's film critic in Telegraph, as far as children's films are concerned, their very quality is to blame.
Collin referred to 2014 as the "worst" year of children's films and how to train Dragon 2 he called a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films set to a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacric servers and their average rating of the Summer Film Premier broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas in the period between the Day of the Victims of War and July 20 in 2013 and that year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in the audience's approach and a higher popularity of Internet servers like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's work on the Jungle Book, the Hollywood Reporter's website said, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already been.
Contrary to the current crisis in Hollywood's cash market, Netflix's profits, thanks to Internet services, have reached $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book rights, predicting Hollywood's "meltdown."
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that there may be something in his catastrophic prophecy.
With the introduction of potential large casino hits in summer 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Outsiders and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
The producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently described a fall in sales as simply "cyclical." For Hollywood Reporter, he said, "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest casino hit in history and no one will worry about selling."
The DPRK is threatening Seoul again, launching another short-range missile.
North Korea launched another short-range missile into the sea, announced Seoul.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparing for the invasion.
The Chagang Province lies in the north-west of the KDLR at the border with China.
According to DPA, a spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Defence stated that the missiles were fired from a location in the North West of the DPRK and flew to a distance of approximately 200 kilometres.
North Korea apparently launched a missile from the Chagang province for the first time, introducing South Korea's media with reference to military circles.
They say there's an underground launch ramp for Scud-type missiles in the province.
It is another of a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea ran an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Faircloud watched the situation during the weekend and spoke to protesters who arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers must have been airlifted from the Blue Mountains.
Two young tourists were picked up by plane and transported to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man took a hike to the Govettes Leap in Blackheath after Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, concerned relatives called the police around 8: 00 p.m.
A search party was sent, including local police and rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11: 00 P.M.
A girl hurt her knee and a man fell and hit his head.
The cops stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In stable condition, they were transported by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc only brought a point from Opava, the prize was on his leg
It was the 23-year-old forvard who could decide, but he failed in the two biggest chances.
After the goal, mainly the shot called at close range three minutes before the end, but instead of the net, it ended up on the goaltender Opava Josef Kvetoneň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself, "you put ashes on your head.
"I guess I should have put it higher under the lid, it slipped a little bit," he pondered.
The Sigma defense did not allow much, except for Mikul's 11-minute raid, which was covered by the Goaltender Reichl.
After that, the Hanais started pushing, but in the block defending the landlord, they didn't let them go, and the shots from a distance were picked up by May.
For 15 minutes, we compared, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more out of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But he didn't change the chance he had laid out, so it ended 0-0, "regretted Coach Hanak Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the lineup, where besides a couple of injured, Petr Vavřík and the three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike its earlier policy, it did not allow them to board.
The surrogates deserve discharge.
Sigma looked more football, but we did not let her do anything except for one standard, "said Petr Baranek, the Silesian coach.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and fighting.
The draw is probably well earned, the point is a good profit for us, "he added.
Sigma is tied to four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Léber, who, after defeat with Znojmo, made his million-dollar deposit into the cash register diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr Léber's warning, so there can be no talk of boys not wanting to fight," said Kalvoda, and added: "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall.
But after the first shot, I will immediately replace him to save his goals for the next match, "said Kalvoda.
Al Pacino got Venice excited twice.
The film festival is otherwise in crisis
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Innerrito suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days suggested that interest in the 71st festival in Venice had fallen somewhat short.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by criticisms recognized, but less attractive pictures as a documentary on genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s with a view of silence and other films with social themes ranging from American 99 homes to Iranian Tales, the cinemas simply left empty seats.
Heroes of comic books
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been surrounded by crowds like in the past, and it has allegedly ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute seat at the hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has hit even as respected institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but only in relation to films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of the comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who in 99 homes successfully played a dramatic role, for all generations without distinction, the main event became the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He lit up an extra one in two movies.
In the story of the Excavation released outside the competition, which was filmed by Oscar Barry Levison, according to the novel Philip Roth, he has a 74-year-old Pacino role close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as a strange owner of a hardware store from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, which David Gordon Green made, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for the best acting performance should not miss it - but does the artist of Pacino's format still need prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction is the love of the audience, and the Italian one especially, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud to be the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first picture of Birdman rewarded with a long standing applause.
The Calabrian branch of the Mafia is viewed in it by the view of family relations between clans that fight for power and money, and the director managed to reconcile all the assumptions for a good film: a good script, a camera, music and actors.
The chamber psychothriller Hunger Heart, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost killed her own child with misguided anxiety.
On the contrary, French competition films have not received a warm reception, nor have they received the Redeemer for glory, nor have they had 3 hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, namely Birdman and the Black Soul, are not that little for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival pictures have mostly depressing themes, a new picture of Peter Bogdanovich, called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy set out in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American cheerleaders in the 1940s, was able to boost the mood for more than one day.
Police caught four meth manufacturers in Prague, drugs were delivered from Poland
"Detectives have arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 in recent days and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold meth in Prague 9 from last November until this August," said police spokesperson Jana Rössler.
At first, on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit in Cihlářská Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in a single person and a young woman who was a drug buyer in Poland and a batch vendor in the group.
The following day, detectives apprehended another member of the group under the prior consent of the state's attorney, a 37-year-old male.
The last of the four officers were caught in the middle of the morning of August 20th in the area of the picturesque incinerator, "was described by the spokesperson.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of activity.
In the workshop of the flight grounds, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konejov Street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced meth, provided various tools and chemicals necessary for its manufacture and ensured the transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the drug further, divided it into plastic bags and then sold the meth.
A 25-year-old, still unpunished woman, helped him transport drugs from Poland or sell drugs to drug addicts.
For this she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third manufactured drug, "added Rössler.
By order of the judge, the CSIs also carried out several home inspections where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, tubing and other devices, which, according to experts, can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the records available, the police found that the chief organizer had been tried seven times since 1995 for property crimes, the woman had not been convicted," added the police spokesperson.
The last detainee was suspended in 2006 for the offence of sexual abuse, and a 37-year-old car mechanic, who is being prosecuted on the loose, has been convicted nine times since 2009.
For him, too, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of wrongful manufacture and other treatment of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they are in danger of ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator finally gave the prosecutor the initiative to apply for custody, where the judge eventually placed them, "said the speaker.
The fourth accused, 37-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case were not as fundamental as the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at very "interesting" prices.
For example, handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm board will serve as a good example in Italy.
If you like it, prepare more than £40,000.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer receives a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fiber.
No one will be surprised that, instead of a classic rider, the players have at their disposal a figure of a rising horse.
If chess does not seem to be a sufficiently valuable gift, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course by hand) of a scale of 1: 1.8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318 305.
Interrupting high schools and high schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and the statistics show that gymnazists have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great training in schools over the last two weeks.
It's mostly routine stuff, like carrying pots from the summer storage room back to class and eating chalk.
They're going to have a little bit more fun at the Burning Mall.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year high school in Hořice opens up and restores its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by entering into the register of schools administered by the MŠMT.
"The French Socialists should shut up and put France in order," says Francois Holland's key ally.
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to "show its support" to a militarily-tuned socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet with the approval of most French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said and received applause.
As an amicable gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite the passionate conjecture by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed at the beginning of the week to free the rules.
On Saturday, Holland asked the Socialists to remain "coherent" with the government.
But Christian Taubiro, the Minister of Justice, drew a line over his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for "the French lost faith in the future because of her."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes among the socialists when she declared that she did not assume that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls, too, were forced to build a new government when the previous one didn't last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter," said Le Pen to her supporters.
It reiterated its party's call to dissolve Parliament and stated that it was convinced that it could win the party's early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to Journal du Dimanche's opinion survey, 76% of French people think that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several competing factions before the end of Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Gambling and street art will not limit Prague until the elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
More gambling rooms will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
Not even dog walking will be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve the amendments to the relevant regulations in the council before the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision to change should not be made by the current management of the city, whose mandate ends in a few weeks'," said Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
Several councils, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel gambling on their territory in recent weeks.
But the games don't disappear, the gambling decree doesn't change yet.
It's the task of the new city's leadership after the election.
Now we would not have done so technically, given, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and so on, "explained Manhart.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment of the Decree, will take place on 11 September.
The referendum on the ban on gambling is being held on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal to the Municipality to extend the current list of prohibited places.
Prague 5 also does not want musicians in the vicinity of the Angel.
The decree regulating dog walking town has been in preparation for several months, not yet completed.
The location of theatres and the issue of busking is dealt with by city regulations.
They can only be issued or edited by the council of the capital.
City councils only have an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue regulations themselves.
Last week, he placed victory at his fingertips for the poponents of Scotland's independence.
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake for the third time, when it almost put the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich on billboards all over Scotland.
But you can't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, or even getting their respect when you threaten them.
The morale of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to expel the translators from the temple than to get dictated by them how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists, Alex Salmond, is well aware of this, which is why he has repeatedly asked his opponent, the Unionist Darling, in the television debate, whether he is willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people," if the Scottish voters had voted for independence, and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
That's what forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with the grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the discussion about Scotland's currency has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defense of the state health service that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London's bankers on the currency issue and also gave the impression that he would not protest the privatisation of health care.
The way Salmond said it, "He got into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who, in Scotland, spoke not to the voters, but to the association of "bosses," to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Union's campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly, absent landlord.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's causing him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not supposed to jump out and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of the school according to Milos Urban
Illustrations to the story The longest year
Miloš Urban Longest Year
The end of the holidays was the best, the last week that never went anywhere again, and we were just lying around, hanging out with the old ladies, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, if you could get them from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fiftieth time, rolling on a bicycle up around the Imperial all the way to the back of the Vars, somewhere near the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun caved back and shoulders, the rays knocked goodbye.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still on holiday mode, sleep at 10: 30, it gets worse in a week, the moments before falling asleep stretch out from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at 6: 30 in the morning.
Monday's coming.
It doesn't usually rain, on the contrary, summer grins in front of the school.
Sailing in the spectral light on a slice and feeling like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there's this school, ZDH A.
A bayou with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of it old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more dashing, girls more busty.
There are punks out there, avoiding them, still interesting how infallibly they stick together and how early they are.
And these grown-up girls who come in loud, they're laughing at something hysterically right now, and I guess something changed in their lives over the holidays, while things are the same with me.
And again, the new first graders, some nervous and some excited, why do they even come here?
Because they have to, an educational military obligation.
So inside, cold floor humidity and a light odor of disinfectant, poisoned janitor with a mop, unfortunately, the same one that they say will lend the pupil the key to the tin box, where you can keep textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the locker room remains in the memory, it is not happening now, it is well-ventilated, but it will be worse in a week.
It's just the imagination that makes your stomach itch and your head hurt.
A head that takes even worse the math teacher, the evil game for the chosen ones, which I am not and never will be.
Once again, the threes and the fours, the fives, hide from the rehearsals, fit in the bench, and best sublimate, be there and not be there, exist just as a name in the classroom, and dream stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas to space where no one competes, does not humiliate anyone, and does not undermine anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She let the unborn daughters die.
She's facing an extraordinary punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in a public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava in March 2012.
Without any help, she was born a little girl who, after cutting the cord, wrapped it in a ready blanket, hid it under her jacket and carried it to a road feeder, where she put it in a bush located a few dozen metres from the road.
She was born on the way to school
I guess it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I felt the need to go to the bathroom, where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the cord with scissors that I wore to school, "the defendant described and stated that she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The following day she returned to the scene, put the child's body in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs of her grandmother's house in Havlíček Brod," she stands in the lawsuit saying that it is not quite clear when the newborn died.
It could have been in dozens of minutes, but it could have been several hours after birth, asphyxiation when covered with a blanket or inserted under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unbound cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
A woman in a more undetected period from February to 12 April, when a child's corpse was found by random witnesses under a bush by a pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, gave birth herself in secret.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive, without cutting and tying the cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, but allegedly he didn't know about the pregnancy of his partner.
For this reason, too, he is not currently on trial, he is only being punished for his transgression against the mortician law.
It was also he who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accessory.
He manipulated the baby against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it seemed to me at the time as a human, "the outrage of the defendant, who allegedly succumbed to and feared a man in a relationship.
In the course of her statement, the young woman spoke in a rather balanced manner.
Tears came to her eyes only when she spoke of a relationship with her parents, from whom she left after she reached age.
She said she didn't want to kill
"She comes to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobs.
I wasn't getting a kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I kept wanting to put him in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do it.
I can't explain that, "she answered the judge's question.
But she refused to act with reason and intent to kill the newborn.
According to her, the second child was also born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I've narrowed it down.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also restricted smoking, "she said.
Although pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed to everyone and to repeated questions that she was having health problems, that she was hydrated.
And so is my friend.
The main trial will continue at the Hradec court on Tuesday with statements from court experts.
On Wednesday, a verdict could already be passed.
A woman is threatened by a criminal sentence of up to 18 years in prison, possibly even with an extraordinary punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching the $3 billion redemption of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole issue, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest cruise operator in the world, has made progress in negotiating the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The business would allow Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, to compete with the greater competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), to access the luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and wealthy clients.
The agreement may already be published this week, revealed the source on Sunday, but pointed out that negotiations still may not end successfully.
Owner of Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be appointed because the negotiations were not public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to the comment request, the Apollo spokesperson refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on voyages in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's income in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company announced sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% more than in the previous year.
The 29 billion-dollar cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in rising economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers to choose cruise destinations.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer with US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority in the company since 2007 since the closure of the $850 million trade.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino companies controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested one billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
The company Norwegian Cruise listed the shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration at the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting held a capital holding of 28%, Apollo 20% and a private investment company, TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration documentation of the first public offer, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
The pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong are provoking the Chinese authorities the day after the decision to vote
A group of people loyal to Beijing, who waved the Chinese flag, stood nearby.
On Sunday, the Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress approved that only two out of three candidates should take part in the elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the support of the nomination committee, which is likely to consist of members of loyal Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot and to force pro-democratic activists to renew their promise and cripple Hong Kong's financial center by protesting the "Central Occupation" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tensions, China's leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June outlining China's official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, attended by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission of Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists have declared that they will be gathering outside the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin is asking Kiev to open negotiations with East Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian Government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and to immediately open negotiations on "state sovereignty" of secluded areas.
His spokesman Dmitri Peskov later explained that Putin's comment did not mean to suggest that the areas of Eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed in order to give the Russian-speaking area the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kyiv government to deal with pro-Russian insurgents as equals is in line with the obvious strategy that he has followed since the outbreak of riots five months ago: help the separatists take over the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant effective independence to the newly declared Novorusk so that instead of joining the West with Russia, he can join forces with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of State TV Putin condemned Ukrainian military events to reclaim the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were dominated by separatists after Moscow enlisted the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have described the recently occupied territory as "Novorussia" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
Russian press agency Itar-Tass released Putin's words that "prisoner is an illusion" to anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns before the parliamentary elections on October 26, while government forces attack civilian populations in areas controlled by separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of state sovereignty of South-East Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev's leadership for several months, and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas about the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that only the Ukrainian Government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The inception of the Kremlin spokesman, which was supposed to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks, highlighted Russia's approach to resolving the separatist uprising in the East, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would be much more difficult to annotate Donetsk and Luhansk in the East of Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and opinion polls that took place before the conflict showed broad support for Ukraine's stay.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, in essence giving the Kremlin effective control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the headquarters of the main Russian naval fleet, maritime commercial facilities and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also a centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inaugural speech of 7 June, Ukraine's President Petra Porošenko proposed that Ukraine's legislators - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give the diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's final call for Kiev to negotiate with separatists as equals followed the insurgents' next week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov penetrated Eastern Ukraine.
The separatists strengthened by the Russians have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal areas all the way to Crimea.
This hastened a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgy complexes of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovska and a narrow gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Jorushenko spoke at the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching the point from which there is no return," said Poorshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday, told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaiska after two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1,000 military units had penetrated the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovaiska during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday with 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, said Lysenko on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the unveiled photo scandal.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet in the biggest celebrity-hacked scandal.
Hacker claims to have 60 photos of the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, Rihanna singer, Ariana Grande, and Ley Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the leak from iCloud, personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actresses Grecko were also reported to have been made public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and distributed to the public.
Now in New York, Greece, according to the newsletters, has told online newspapers that hacking is "shameless," and those who have become his target "feel humiliated."
It's believed that the hacker acquired 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of him lying topless by the pool.
Palmer performed, for example, in the film Love and Honor, where Liam Hemsworth was her counterpart.
Palmer, the star of the TV series Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen pictures yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a clear violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen hacked on his twitter criticized: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
Legally, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Soccers Sigma made up for Léber, even without winning
Olomouc - Thunder and lightning, which the co-owner of Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seems to have been in the past.
Even though they only brought in a point from Opava for a goal-free draw.
They've made up a little bit of the club boss by putting on and fighting.
Payroll money could come to the club soon.
"I will keep one more game, as I spoke about it last week, but I am already much more optimistic," said Léber, that despite the fact that Sigma did not win, the players convinced him by improved performance.
The fight and commitment that we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive you for not winning.
If we had played this way since the beginning of the season, I believe we have not yet lost, "thinks Léber.
Sigma in Opava broke the initial pressure of the home, then tied the game, and it was better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvod's trustees reached the goal, but they couldn't win.
The result is not as we want it to be.
To our satisfaction, however, we lacked only one chance to change, "said Léber, who does not think that only his threat has caused a change in the attitude of football players.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether from my side, from coach or fans, "said Léber.
The pressure must count on Sigma.
After the Opava game last week, the players didn't want to comment.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to admit it, "young goaltender Michal Reichl shook his head.
Without comment, he then left a question for Léber's statement from last week, the assailant Václav Vasíček, who did not change Sigma's greatest opportunity in Saturday's game.
But then after that, he talked a little bit about pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to come at us.
Today we showed that if we all fight and ride our asses, we can do it, "he said.
The warnings were taken to heart
Coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide that preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that existed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that Mr. Léber's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't that they didn't want to fight and screw it up before, "said Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to come to terms with the stubbornness and realize what the second league was all about.
That it's not just about football, but mostly about the fighting, "said Kalvoda.
All we can hope for is that in the next match, Sigma will be able to make it work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
