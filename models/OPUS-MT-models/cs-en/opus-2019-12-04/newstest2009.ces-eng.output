The Prague Stock Exchange has fallen to a minute at the end of trade
After the morning sharp decline, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares have reached almost half of daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange has been following up on its Monday fall since the beginning of Tuesday's trade, falling by almost six percent.
This time, there's a fall in stock on Wall Street.
We, too, have a market reaction to the outcome of the vote by the US House of Representatives, which has refused to support the plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
Shares falling in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday saw stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock market wrote off almost four percent during trade, but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has fallen by 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The stock market shares in Sydney were losing more than five percent, but in the end, the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The market in Taiwan has fallen by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," noted the head of Hong Kong's monetary office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy separately, that is, without dependence on China's central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly return to negotiations and approve the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it is said that other countries are also at risk of being affected.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the financial system support plan, for which up to $700 billion was to be spent (almost CZK 12 trillion).
So the legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy.
American stock had a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices have seen the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost seven percent and recorded a decline to a similar extent last in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the motion in the House had failed, the index was in a free fall.
Congress retreated: The US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and President George W. Bush's government have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
US legislators have made a breakthrough in talks about approving a rescue plan in the form of a $700 billion financial assistance to the US financial system (about $12 trillion).
But it's not won yet.
The congressmen must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters was told by the chairman of the Barney Frank House Banking and Financial Services Committee.
In the Senate, according to sources, there might be a vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then there will be "sobriety" due to the complexity of mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences on what the market stabilisation package should look like, "said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Lawyers' representatives met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the final form of government funds.
This should buy out non-marketable mortgage assets from financial companies that withdraw financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
The recovery plan still needs to be continued, but I think we're there, "said Paulson.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying so hard to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet clear, with certainty, when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, or whether the last-minute negotiations can't be caught up in any problem.
The legislators are hoping to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still has a number of changes.
The total amount to be allocated for the assistance of the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
Congress, however, may block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the programme is failing in its function, in a series of additional $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciates the progress in the negotiations
The President may veto this decision, but Congress may overrule its veto.
But, despite these changes, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy out bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday, "stated Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates the "mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of gold parachutes
The Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the head negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on liability for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of concessions, the timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the members of the programme and to set up a committee to supervise the Fund.
That should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who have problems with their repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments to debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to chief economist Patria Finance David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement it.
"And that's because they don't know what mechanism and at what price problem assets will be bought out.
This will determine how to split the losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek for the iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, Mark says it's not that important.
"It is much more important that this week's congressmen agree to support this plan and to sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement to be approved is most important at the moment, "said Marek.
Knife-cutting match: MP3 players against cell phones.
We will advise on how to choose
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
That makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Yet there are enough reasons to get a single player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the demands of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get a high-end high-end record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the one hand, such music products are not produced on LP plates and there is no objective reason for that from a qualitative point of view.
If, however, vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues is in your shelves, you are likely to dream of such a gramophone.
It's the same with music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan, to bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes where there's enough room for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The battery endurance is determined as well.
Some high-end music players can do a lot more than just play music, but what most cell phones can't.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephoning and texting, he can play music and video, record both, have a better camera, and maybe he can navigate.
And considering smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, no fridge can grill and no TV takes pictures.
The universality of the phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the display indicator sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than ten twelve hours, usually a lot less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap phones, you can count on them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you make one more phone call every now and then, just to be sure, get one more charger - this applies to more expensive devices as well.
You will not have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem is recording music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the device has a universal USB connector, and not every one of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but few card readers can manage with miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
You don't need any special software for players except for the exceptions (iPod).
Just fill the machine with music via USB from the computer.
Most cell phones and players already create their own music library according to the name of the artist, album name, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to Windows explorer and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to serve, mobile phones are more skilled
When selecting a specific device, take particular care about battery life, memory capacity, sound output quality and type of sound output and, of course, control comfort.
If the music is primarily a set and you listen to it every day for a short time in a tram, you need any phone that plays MP3.
Which can actually do almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch what music formats your phone or player can do.
The MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread, and besides it, the vast majority of machines can also handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPod).
Better mobile phones also allow for online purchase of music, for example.
All you have to do is visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already, in itself, be a strong argument for the acquisition of a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to fast-track radio hits.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that it is this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) that is the future of the music industry.
Most people carry their cell phones around all the time.
Whenever you want to hear something, feel your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage of musical phones will be for many prizes.
The cheapest ones are normally under 3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent Walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be restricted by the absence of output to ordinary headphones.
The best and most equipped phones with 3.5 mm socket for standard headphones cost up to 15,000.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really anyone.
The minimum functions, the similarity of control with the previously common cassette player or, for example, the gramophone is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile internet and then a huge data transfer account.
What kind of device does it reach for?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an exchange card slot (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than CZK 1,100.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, feel for specialized walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungy).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to the individual MP3 player.
It is the longest in Sony Ericsson, whose walkman cell phones have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to CZK 4,000, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum), will take MP3 players away from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classics cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written on Mobil.cz many times about the fact that Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe.
After all, the ČTI also confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - SMS from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to fight.
It may sound paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and more than 100% penetration.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to beg that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classical operator with his own network probably no longer has much chance (after all, it would probably be hard to look for frequencies).
But there is one other option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant price reductions, to which the classical operators had to respond.
Even before the pike entered, there were voices similar to those of us in the UK before Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to acquire over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The financial group Penta, which owns U: fona, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more specific target group.
For them to function effectively, it is enough for them to have fewer customers than for a classical operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on an unprecedented target group can be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Administrative men elect a Mobilking operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a concept similar to that of Poland could be caught by us.
Vodafone's press secretary Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service supply. '
In the Czech Republic, no chance, they say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about expanding this successful project, but the negotiations do not look very hopeful in the Czech Republic.
More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region, "she said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studnicková, press secretary of the financial group Penta.
Indirectly confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
Rather the contrary, they try to do everything they can to prevent any potential competitor from forming.
For some time now, the GTS Novera group has not been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of O2 Telephonics in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them in the negotiations, "says Pavel Kaidl, the spokesperson for the group.
Maybe there's a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that we should be looking forward to the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far we have not been approached by any subject with a complex and serious project in this area, "said Vlastimil Sršt from the Press Department of O2 Telephonics in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile's spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2: "So far, we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further."
And he says, "It's hard for a virtual operator to show up in T-Mobile by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to be able to think in this short term. "
Vodafone pays more attention to meet the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider most beneficial in terms of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet. "
Responsible offices - with operators one hand
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a fall in prices and thus a fall in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
The fact that when operators are interested in something, they can pull together, is also a testament to the U: Fona.
Probably the greatest pressure towards the ČTU went at the time of the creation of U: phone from T-Mobile.
This is indicated by publicly available information from the ČTU website.
But right now U: the phone fits as an argument why not admit the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová also pointed out: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently boosted by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services. "
However, due to this approach of mobile operators, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is directly striking.
This is not just about the ČTU position, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took a typical stance on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator to rent the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, since the offer of potential buyers was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators, "said Kristian Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in response to our query.
It may not surprise the representatives of operators to make such a statement.
From an office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one takes advantage of their position on the market, that is more than a serious one.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the price drop is not one of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In fact, the shocking thing about the whole case is the touching combination of three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is being offered entirely alone.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is certainly only a result of coincidences and tough competition.
"The Office did not find any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this matter and therefore has no reason to interfere in any way.
None of the operators is in a dominant position and therefore does not have the appropriate increased responsibility for their market behaviour.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to lack the telecommunications regulator, "said Chalupa.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points at issue.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets by the ČTU, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
Of course, in such a market, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always needed to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator, he has a pretty logical monopoly on his network.
So in a particular segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to the OHS that three mobile operators are progressing in a striking manner.
Meanwhile, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The imposition of liability on the Czech Technical Service is then a relatively common trick in telecommunications, by which the OHS gives its hands away from the whole matter.
We've met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the ČTU's powers to competition in telecommunications was not successful, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the Authority must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's okay when no one's looking.
The operation of pseudovirtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own mobile phone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
They are usually multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
These companies' price lists usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic company customer who orders a large number of SIM cards against the operator.
As an important customer then gets special price (and more) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resales.
"If there were cases that you are referring to, there could be a breach of the terms of the contract that we would be dealing with and could result in an end to cooperation with the company," said Martina Kemrova on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such action would be brought to the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, it may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is prevented from doing so.
In fact, these companies are making considerable profits, and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it fully as normal customers of mobile operators. "
That, however, should be at least odd.
In addition, another question is being raised for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar process, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to detect similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators that they have no knowledge of this and their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators to the mobile market has brought a noticeable fall in prices for services.
In fact, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
The arguments used were virtually identical - too small or too saturated a market, problems with quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these times that regulators, which defended not the interests of mobile operators but their customers, intervened.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved that the first virtual operator was created and others were packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case around like a hot potato.
From our experience, we can't help but think that the ambiguity in these cases is more than appropriate.
But let's not throw the flint into the rye.
If the back-up information is correct and the virtual operator is really soon to appear, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will hardly be possible for the OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Czech State festively introduced new recordings of the national anthem.
The National Theatre Orchestra, led by Jiří White-Hlavík, has now recorded the anthem.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choir presentation and instrumental text.
Kateřina Knežínková and Adam Sailing took the lead.
The authors of the anthem modifications are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
White Head considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymens.
He had already told the Czech Radio that he deliberately chose singers with young representative voices for singing solo variants, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried with both of them and then also with the choir to ensure that they had a clear dictation, so that the text was understood well, to be sympathetic," he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home was first sung in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovský Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlováček Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her for their own.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the Czech Republic.
How does "new" anthem sound?
Prague public transport on Wednesday for the first time even on the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will be entered in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, tram and bus, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, he can get about 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (which will apply from 1 January 2009) while recording their chip card in the traffic business's infoculars and workplaces at the metro stations Muzeum, Bridge, Holešovice Station, Angel, Roztyla, Letňany, Kobylisa, Garden of Eden, Kacherov and Luka.
Buyers can also be purchased via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz. since yesterday
Over 400 customers have used the service by afternoon hours.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the window of the metro stations, where they still had to stand regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon online, and they upload it to the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places passengers are provided with a counter with trained service, which will help interested people with online purchase and also upload a purchased coupon to their card," said Martin Petrný, the spokesperson for the project.
In addition to libraries it will be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several vestibule metro.
What do vending machines look like?
They are red, resembling ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Budejovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Now there are five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," added the Caretaker.
The coupon checks the driver's seat of the automatic
The service of the vending machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid coupon will upload itself to it.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
Thus, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, mainly the inhabitants of the Central Bohemian municipalities go to the capital.
"On trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the conductor is equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal's ticket check from the Ropid organisation, which compiles timetables for Prague public transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's cash register.
So not only does the chip card have to be shown to the driver, but also it is necessary to attach Opencard to the designated place on the side of the ticket counter.
This will check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," added Drápal.
Passengers who do not ride suburban buses and will not remember when the coupon expires may go back to self-service vending machines where the card coupons are recorded.
Here, information on the validity of their documents will be displayed on the instrument display.
Sudets wanted a referendum from the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the inclusion of Shumava with the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live, at least, under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This follows, among other things, from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and is today stored in collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the US President not to allow the return of the "Šumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we want to be really sure that US troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in a letter signed in the words "People to whom the fate of Shumava lies at heart."
Since joining Czechoslovakia allegedly gives Sudeten Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, indiscretions, oppression and slavery, the authors of the US President's letter to take over the protectorate for both present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign country that opposes and disproves minorities and nothing," it says in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is the fear of the vengefulness of "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Shumava, it was enough for him to hold a referendum on whether his people wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naïve in today's knowledge of postwar history, some of the memoirs think it appropriately illustrates the then expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Even though the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that they would be relocated from the Republic, few of them allowed such an option at all.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was like a Buddejov German stationed in the Baltic Navy during the war.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would need Czech," said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia expected to be relegated from the Republic on the basis of Benes' decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign attacks the driver
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Jeèíček promises to discourage the driver from acting dangerously behind the wheel.
A 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
He wants to touch his conscience mainly with young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the "bloody" slogan of the campaign says:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay."
It's supposed to symbolize that a man can pay for his own life in a moment of inattention.
The audience will "haunt" spots until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of victims of accidents can be commonly seen.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and driver's whip
"The driver is subject to a system of sugar and whips.
The sugar for them is that, for example, if they run a red light, it saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk, "says the transport psychologist at the Hospital of Homolka Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative ads are needed, meaning a psychologist.
According to him, boards are less effective, which alert the driver to danger.
"If a static hazard warning board is installed, it will probably soon blend with the environment and the drivers will not pay attention to it," said the Koran.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The President of the Provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Prejordan, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview that was published on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," said Olmert's diary.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to pass on a similar percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that the possible recovery would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," noted Olmert in reference to two July attacks in the city, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places" that lie within the Old Town.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he stressed further.
Leaving Golan Heights
Olmert has also spoken for Israel's exit from Golan Heights, which he believes is an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only after leaving Golan," he pointed out.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up the continued support provided by Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (the terrorist networks) and jihad (the holy wars) in Iraq, "the Prime Minister stated.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padova, Italy, the question arose as to whether the stewards and passengers can move on the bus while travelling.
"If we would like to follow the law strictly and formally, the steward's activity is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old steward last week was probably caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least secure place in the car, although she has two more seats.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with standing positions according to the technical licence.
If the bus is not homologed, the passenger must sit.
The Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing space; this is also confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This was discussed with the Ministry and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
They then called it off, and we came to the conclusion that passengers were allowed to go to the toilet if they had a seat, "he gave his opinion.
The Steward's Law does not know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation solves that role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of a vehicle conductor; its rights and obligations are not defined, "says Hanzelka, less unequivocally.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Department of Road Vehicles, thinks that the law deals with the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus in the homologation is allowed to stand.
That's the end of it, "he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where there are stand points and limited maximum speed, interurban areas with standing areas with a higher speed allowed and long distance without standing areas with the highest speed permitted and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
Expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of stewards on board the bus does not see the fundamental problem.
"There is not much danger when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to the service on aircraft.
It's not even certain when the turbulence comes and the stewardess can hit her head. "
"But if the bus were to brake sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on the city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be dealt with by the carrier by internal regulations, "he says and also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel services
The student agency offers steward services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 of them.
Even after the accident, the Director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward profession is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to passengers at boarding.
It would also save costs, "he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asian Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his cars.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been up against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end in some fatal accident, "he said less than a year ago for Week.cz.
There's been a terrible tragedy.
A young steward from Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on a link to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned off without using the router from the standstill lane and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid a violent maneuver, but he lured him to the right of the front.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Janchur refuses.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company's going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ruling, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The law?
I can't see
Specifying the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about an amendment to the law, on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, it has not reached any concrete conclusion.
The buses do not even solve much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile while driving, "says the expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be a major threat to the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesperson Hanzelka, saying that the safety check of buses is the responsibility of the police and the employment safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The large words in the letter from the board of directors of WestLB are not missing from the employees of this bank.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Deca-Bank of Frankfurt, the "central institution of the financial group of savings banks for capital market trading," we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring into this transaction a "set of competences" ensuring long-term returns.
And it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impetus for further pooling in the Landesbanks' sector.
Such texts are created when the board wants to demonstrate its ability to act during a problematic period.
Indeed, unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the link between Deka-Bank, which savings banks' customers have known for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas was told at the end of August that he did not see any sense in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with any of the Landesbanks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is worth half of the Landesbank and half of the savings banks' association, has entrusted the Board of Directors with talks with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or part of it.
But the talks have only just begun, and the financiers are concerned.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important financial market employers in Frankfurt, is not the first to be talked about in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, there seemed to be a merger between Deka-Bank and Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
After all, there was nothing out of this triple polka.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessen Land Government opposed Helaba's participation.
Even the other bank houses didn't come together like that.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite this, speculation has repeatedly emerged about the connection between Deka-Bank and the Landesbanks.
However, recently, Günther Merl, Chairman of Helaba Bank's Board of Directors, has expressed negative views on the speculation about the merger of its financial house with others.
It seems, however, that, regardless of this, it ripens the belief that the convergence of different public sector banking houses is a necessity.
Now, following the elections to the Bavarian Regional Assembly, BayernLB's connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could begin to emerge first.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If it were to increase the pressure for further mergers, it would gradually lose potential partners for such a connection.
In the south, only the second violin would play, despite the fact that the financial crisis still faces much better than the banks' houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Moreover, the connection with WestLB was prohibited by the Association of Savings Bank and the Gentile Banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 80% stake in Helaba.
This would be the case at most for Nord LB.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of what business model would be to ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German savings banks' association and the gentiles' banks had not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter from the Board of Directors also mentions that it seeks a "comprehensive solution" for the whole bank house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual files to Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "weekend with Italians"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or the fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so he says everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at a five-litre Kaiser barrel, is a stronger bearded man and 200 tourists on Oktoberfest show how deep the tones can give out his throat.
Elena's gonna slap Luca first and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," supposed arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, and only Brazilians are on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing their flag, celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
Marco, who is wearing a long coat with a fur lining and glasses with wide silver frames, belongs to the three buses.
For five years, he's been taking them to Oktoberfest, he's doing three trips this year alone.
At night there, during the day between the beer stands, at 10: 30 to leave back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast to Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian law on beer cleanliness, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
The buses take off into the night, after the car park towards "Brennero."
Beer's not served, not yet.
The bus shuts up quickly, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they'll need their powers.
He stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where he takes one more break on Highway 8, just before Munich, and many other buses with Italian plates.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwies at 6: 30 in the morning, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has his last speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First of all, put on a yellow hat.
It says "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Two: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" Marco calls into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Don't get in the way, and don't put all the yellow hats on the same bench, spread out in space!"
Mas costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guys we behave.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone! "
Three: "Be back here tonight at 10: 30 sharp!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, a place with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group puts yellow hats on the trees, signs, and even on an election poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As a "weekend with Italians" is known as the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
The exact figures on the number of visitors are not available; they are talking about 50,000 of those who are travelling through the Alps and entering beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The order of Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains national statistics in which Italians (about 60 hits) and Austrians (about 80) take first place with approximately 200 medical treatments.
The most popular is the Hofbräu tent with the Italians.
Seamless nights for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this politician has used the word 'relatively', and has also impacted on his claim the fact that the German banking sector will not remain spared from crisis developments.
Because that's what happened last weekend.
The Dax index followed by a financial house specialising in the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan of several billion from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the loan aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) out of a truly exhausted amount.
They say money comes from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to the press release on long-term projects for which he lent money, this state financier has been extremely short-term refinanced, which is no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrunk by 95% to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio decreased slightly from 1.6% to 1.45%.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, income from the increased value of receivables and from certain securities, as well as the abolition of the credit-trading reserves fell by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Thanks only to the higher revenues from the compensation for the subsequent settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the interest compensation under the tax rules and for the brokerage of trade for group companies, the 16% fall on the part of the revenues was still moderate.
The former state financier, after his privatisation in 1990, burned himself on mortgages for traders, which were then set aside from the service portfolio and kept by Aareal Bank.
Since the classic state funding was made too little, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint private investor and state projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something off, and these write-offs will have a "substantial material effect" on the calculation of the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have indefinitely let themselves be heard.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It has already been shortened by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depf.
More strongly than other institutions, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, two weeks ago, a source of interbank loans practically dried up, as banks guard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - about EUR 50 billion - every year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the group's financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is "protected from the influence of international money markets to a large extent currently unable to function."
Other sources have been told that this money provides refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets anytime soon.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervision Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured on the market.
This is what the shareholders and creditors of the bank are hoping for.
But, given the dynamism and the indebtedness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely impossible that the loan does not need to be fully exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank seemed to have stood before insolvency on Sunday afternoon, the rescue cannot, however preliminary, calm the passions.
The share exchange rate fell by 75 percent to €3.30.
On the contrary, bond courses were well followed.
While preferential debts have barely moved, secondary bond courses have become more pronounced.
This mainly concerns the bonds of Württemberg Hypo's former subsidiary and logical bonds with maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate had originally appeared to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood, depending on the stability of the international financial system, after a significant intensification of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as emission banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, securities may be paid by their maturity.
But it can also happen what hardly anyone now dares to hope for - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming along with this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This, in particular, will probably prepare long-term creditors a number of nights to decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may at least use the cut-off line to create a loss transfer from previous financial years to later exchange-rate yields for the purposes of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and mystery box bento
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is introduced to her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start giggling: the German is totally "kawai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows that word from the mangos, and she's talking about Japan on her new exchange blog.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was scared of going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, luckily I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of the Tachibana teaching is not given as strictly as the beginning of our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after 8: 00 and 20 minutes before 9: 00 starts a short session with a teacher called 'home room'.
But before class started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mom, with a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So I put myself on the stand like this and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajonara Wo She Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvan, I come from Germany and in a week my birthday.
At that point, I was so glad I started learning language two years ago.
All 31 girls in class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawai'.
I already knew that from my mangoes.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means' cute, sweet '.
Then I quickly sailed into my place.
The girl next to me smiled pretty wide, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the bell rang, they literally buried me.
They were talking through each other and giggling and asking me about the possible and the impossible - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all unpacked their bents.
My host mom made me this lunch box, too, and that's different than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in a tofu batter.
I don't usually know exactly what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
The thing is, everything's really good.
Well, except for the salt plums, man!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is particularly artistically modified, hoping to get to know a guy at lunch at recess.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan? 'my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
And then I always said,
'Cause I'm just fascinated.
After all, I've liked to read mangoes for years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
It was clear to me, then, that one day I would have to come here.
Because I also have a thing for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
Japan, on the one hand, is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen. "
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify whether they feel the same way when they're acting like us?
For several years, the Internet magazine "Edge" has published contributions from known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else ever being able to prove it, when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we start to pursue another species and open up the issues of perception or general consciousness, we enter a difficult terrain, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, he'll do the same as many other animals: he'll pretend to be dead, run away or attack.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists consider comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal experience.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share in short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the language nature of man: because so much of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter to the language, it would certainly be influenced by the language, so that the animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
That's why it's hard to figure out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, we can't even measure it because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, it puts us in the face of great problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of conscious experience, but besides, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick have addressed, focuses more on neural correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: they may both be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of non-frontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I derive from the fact that an emotional system, such as a fear system, is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) takes advantage of the operating memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In connection with language nature, there is a subtle degree of perception, because we can distinguish and categorize states using words and grammar to add them to each other.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in cortex and brain stem areas dedicated to body feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily be involved in feelings perceived by multiple animal families.
In theory, I cannot contradict this, but I find it inconclusive.
Pankseep argues that what we see as fear in rats and humans probably feels both organisms the same way: but how can we verify, then says Pankseep whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experience.
It is true that neural comparisons move us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, and, on the other hand, cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it in humans, how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I'm gonna prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can look forward to progress at the neural level if we measure the same thing in rats and humans.
Like rats, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't even examine feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be seen as short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than throw myself against the wall repeatedly.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," said Vasjunyk.
"But it is not amnesty for our country.
Work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries. "
In the early implementation of the timetable for the construction or conversion of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are lagging behind.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible, "said Grigory Surkis, President of the Ukrainian Union.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
Following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the leadership of the Polish PZPN was withdrawn and replaced by independent trustee Robert Zawlockim.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister for Sport Mirosław Drzewiecky.
It is said that "there is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said the Polish press agency, PAP.
"By letter, we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that he would not suffer from the preparation for ME 2012."
Several major league teams were sentenced to forced descent just last season because of manipulations, eventually even a quick shift to the start of the league had to be made.
Robbed Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new movie, talk about private things - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He's furious and strikes back.
The late Rose War with the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having a nasty fight - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan spoke for the first time in an interview with InStyle last week on the grounds of the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she didn't know the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The motivation for this mental stripping was for Ryan's PR work for her new movie "The Women" - which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: He is "crazy," said the forty-five-year-old New York Daily News actor that "Meg repeatedly chews up the history of our relationship and modifies it."
In addition, it is "regrettable" that the joint 16-year-old son of Jack once again "publicly resembles the pain and radical changes that divorce is to every child."
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He ends his thinking about cheating like this: "Anyway, my life goes on.
I think I'm lucky to have an amazing family that's doing great. "
Ticket and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by American Express Travel and Financial Service Provider.
The company analysed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and, after the price increase in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of price increases on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 out of the 48 European cities under review still increased by 6.9% on average compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
As a result of this trend, American Express considers the dollar's weak exchange rate, which has caused "a declining appetite for American tourists to travel."
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centers more strongly than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have even recorded a European record by increasing 26.3%.
Ticket prices also showed an even upward trend in the first quarter:
Because of the kerosene price, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, with fuel-intensive long-distance flights even up to 29.2 percent higher.
From April to June the prices of tickets in Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class classes, changes in knowledge were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, dropped by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices fell even by half.
One reason for this price drop is the slowdown in economic growth, explained by the company.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of a strained situation is the cancellation of non-profitable routes by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe, it was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1: 0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to assemble a working 11.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the failed landing for the representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player got into the game late and failed with a jagged balloon on a stick.
His report was precisely worded and sounded convincing from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," shouted Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the hamburger arena.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the halftime break was over, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
For nearly three decades, Rieger has been a physical therapist for HSV and enjoys more respect than many of the short-term actors.
And so his request was also answered in a responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol was attracted to an assistant and, as a sign of agreement, he raised his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His orders were probably similar: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"Things didn't look good here today," later Marcell Jansen admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it "more relaxed."
For 1: 0 (1: 0) Hamburg owes the head of Mladen Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbasheans could not harm the weak Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The hamburger SV will celebrate this Monday 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated table on the video wall in which their team was listed as the premier.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
They suspect that the ongoing tabular result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goaltender Petrić and FC Bayern won by Jansen - is slowly located, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribling," said Jol emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports on the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow put on some weight again.
Around 20.30, this world's most important exchange barometer showed a five percent drop to 10.579 units.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in the negative at 1548 points.
The worst part was in Down at this point American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' shares lost almost ten percent.
Until a few days ago, a large investor named Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the whole amount is not to be paid at the same time, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive equity warrants from financial companies that could be reimbursed if the exchange rate develops favourably, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock rates in Europe are falling sharply
Billionaire aid to banks in Europe and the US does not deprive investors of doubt.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly downgraded and is downloading the Dax index.
The US Dow Jones index is losing the state despite the planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular exchange losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commercial Bank tore down the index of German shares (Dax) deep into the negative.
Despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks, the shares of that Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below a psychologically important threshold of 6000 points and with a negative 3.7 percent scored 5 839 points.
All over the world, stock markets have gone down.
In New York, a business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion bailout package by the US government might not be enough to revive financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first trading hour and is thus at 10 809.25 points.
The American House of Representatives is to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could comment on October 1st.
Other European exchanges were only going one way: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, and the CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese leader of the Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11 743.61 units after initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18 286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent, and the trading ended at 12 595.75.
In MDAX, after the announcement of the increase in the core capital, the shares of Arcandor were lost.
Private Bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourist group announced that Thomas Cook would not sell the shares in the company.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of the fuel lines that will soon freeze, she is now threatened with cold death.
For years, one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - an anomaly in the gravitational slingshot.
A gravitational slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some kind of space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to that, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses sun probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case in wonder: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, irregularities occur in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by an anomaly in the gravitational slingshot.
Several experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general relativity theory, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot through the so-called dark matter, whose presence in space was discovered by astronomers.
"The responsibility for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously based on a gravitational force, the effect of which on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means that she does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to scientific calculations, this dark matter is a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large.
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to a communication from the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, tourists are once again at large.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
They say six kidnappers were killed in a shootout before they were released.
Five Germans were abducted in the south of Egypt.
I hear the ransom negotiations are underway.
The Germans are repeatedly being targeted by the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists introduced to the Sahara seem to be free.
It was reported by Egyptian national television, al-Arabiya Arab television station and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini reported that the Italian television station Sky TG 24 confirmed his release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been liberated.
We are now verifying their health, "said Frattini.
According to the Egyptian State TV report, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, and also their eight Egyptian guides are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert appear to be on their way to Cairo.
Unclear remains the background of the shootout before the hostages were released: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"Problem solved.
They agreed to the ransom, "said the quoted worker.
He said "it was all about taking the hostage," when suddenly it came to "this surprise."
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money was to be passed on to the German wife of one of the hostages.
El Masri El Jom, referring to one of the German intermediaries, stated that the release of hostages is prolonged because the kidnappers fear for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by the stepfather have led a woman to kill herself to be heard in court.
After confessing to eight sexual harassment cases, 27-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle was regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," he wrote to Trerise in a confession.
It was also said in court that Miss Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and bound her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was before the court that Miss Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse committed twice a week.
The prosecutor, Ramsey Quaife, said in court that in 2006, Ms. Randle's friends, who was also very interested in surfing and cycling, said that she was "emotionally dead" and "gave up her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her flat in Plymouth.
They say she suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with saying, "I tied her up and bound her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetish, and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not, the matter would probably not have come to court at all. "
"I would particularly like to stress the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Apparently, otherwise, she'd probably be a promising, successful, and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the Waterloo train at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the law in question, and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was handled internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
A staff member who may not be appointed shall be charged in accordance with Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police to charge the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al Qaeda and the possibility of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Collaborative bookmarks face debt B & B
British cooperative backups may have to deal with the debts of more than £80 million after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative advances.
The CEO of the Association of Cooperative Advances (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "humbling" that the reserves and their members had to pay.
In the end, the $14 billion debt will be repaid by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
In the meantime, however, interest will be paid annually by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The BBC Compensation Plan confirmed that all 59 cooperative advances are accounted for in that number.
It is humbling that these institutions, which have behaved wisely... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so far-fetched.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company should pay proportionally to the deposits they held, and that the back-up companies should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
That means the backups will have to find £81 million to pay off the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperative reserve business association, told the BBC that he was convinced it wasn't fair.
"It is degrading that those institutions that acted wisely during the expansion of the housing market must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were by far not so prudent."
According to BSA, there hasn't been any backup since 1945 when they appeared.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this in the next few weeks to see what the possibilities are for protecting cooperative backups and their members from an account that could be substantial," added Cole.
Interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year, and that could be almost twice as much.
As the cooperative reserves are shareholder-free units, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk is up by five pence per litre
People in Jersey might have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy Company has announced that from Monday it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre.
It is the second price increase this year, after two pennies in February, and comes after the research carried out by the consultancy company.
The retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the price of the price in the customer price.
The wholesale price of milk from Jersey was last changed in 2002 before the increase in February.
Bail for the ex-prime minister of Bangladesh denied
The Bangladesh court dismissed the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid's request for bail, which means that if she returns to her country, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegation that she received more than 50 million taka from a certain businessman ($729 700) when she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption brought against it.
Khalida Ziyama, a long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), asked that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was released on her word of honour to be able to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear, under the terms of her release, whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, stating that it did not need bail when he was already on parole abroad," said Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasina was to return home after 17 October.
She was detained last year after the army-held interim government took over, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalida Ziya both reject all charges made against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, almost 200 000 children did not participate in the recent polio vaccination due to violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the UN carried out vaccination in six provinces.
But she says that for security reasons, she couldn't get to the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
A UN spokesman said that this happened despite Taliban promises that he would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB lost the ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost a lawsuit to review the Commission's decision on competition, which ordered the company to reduce its share of the competing broadcasting company ITV.
BSkyB's Competition Court of Appeal ordered it to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9% to 7,5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB's share was hampering competition and giving the company disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a business which, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had given rise to doubts about ITV's independence and called on the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The head of the Virgin Sir Richard Branson Consortium, the consumer organization and the Ofcom regulator were all against buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its share in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - mainly because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to waive its voting rights.
New investigation into the affair of American lawyers
The US Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine US attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where the story of the affair produced by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was fueled by concerns that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now be investigating whether the investigators who were questioned lied to the investigators in the course of the investigation with a view to obstructing justice.
In the report, Inspector General Glenn Fine stated: "Serious allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Department of Justice relieved nine US lawyers of their functions in December 2006.
That's when the Ministry said that lawyers were released for poor performance.
However, it later became clear that the lawyers' release was not judged any worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the redundancies were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, others refused to investigate the charges of deceiving voters against Democrats.
American lawyers are investigating and prosecuting lawsuits for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire because of the layoffs and eventually resigned.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The General Inspector's report spoke very critically about Gonzales' role in the affair, saying that he had "major responsibility" for the redundancies, that he had "abdicated" from his leadership position and had not been "remarkably involved."
Other officials, including Karl Rove's former high-level Bush advisor, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of Q Awards for his epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who comes to London next weekend for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" by his recognition.
The song that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nomination is led by the Coldplay group, which has reached a short selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, head editor of Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and reached the 15th place at most.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been on the list for about nine years and has been sold around the world for over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 it was operated on due to irregular heart rhythm after it collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Turns out he had a cyst on his vocal cords later.
Obscure street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only useful.
But even many taxi-veterans and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village district, and it leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a transport pull.
There are no street signs.
It's practically invisible in a common atlas.
Yet the alley has an admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to repave the Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are long-time neighbors who say that they were charmed by a shortened aisle simply because it was one of the last remains from before the block was treated.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of the Building, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the Municipal Community, representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay drew up a plan according to which the developer of the street should buy.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the Municipal Community 3, the Committee prefers a variant where the street remains in the hands of the city and asks for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like to keep Extra Place in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to pave a small street and place seating places, several of which would use a cafe whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale had been designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Conservation, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and he pointed out that his office's job is to develop assets rather than manage them.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorn's big farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed the narrow stretch of the country.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk-rock monument, closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background photograph on the album cover of the Ramones' "Rocket to Russia."
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took a picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some local bloggers, including bloggers who write about the processing of the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and argue that the piece of public property, albeit modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "Book of Wailing: a bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the extinction process"), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the column Let's Talk about a city that appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even during the day, and bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and slammed windows, where a week's old newspaper runs through the grates."
Except for a few exceptions, the alley of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door, which once led to CBGB, in whose place today stands the store of expensive clothes.
There were graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty beer bottle next to a fresh batch of dumped newspapers.
A few bystanders said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they suggested that he could use some encouragement.
On the other hand, Fields said that he thought that some people underestimated the intensity of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, wet and disgusting."
Bilingvalidity debate: immersion in English
Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education in this edition.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and head of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Worse Than You Think: Why Middle Class Needs To Choose Schools."
It's a tricky business to reach out effectively to Hispanic voters.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Hispanic students are considerably less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda advocates, in particular, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are still learning English.
But the question for Barack Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in class, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanic from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have just arrived, are still learning English.
Despite this, in the 2008 state tests on mathematics, an incredible 100% of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Almost as amazing as ninety-three percent of fourth-grade pupils got to the highest level in state tests from English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a method other than Obama's preference.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of skills and access without excuses.
Furthermore, and this Obama should notice is according to Lindy Mikels, director of Sixth Street, pedagogical approach school for those who are still learning English, "complete immersion."
Immersion in English highlights the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me, "We had a tremendous success with one brand-new student from Mexico - after 12 months, you would walk into a classroom and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school as Sixth Street Prep as a role model, what should other schools look like with large shares of Hispanic and English learning pupils?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education is unclear by the predictions of Obama's response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead of "making sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational models that work, rather than ridicule them and trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices plummeted on Monday because of fears that even the US plan to save financial markets might not revive the economy.
Prices of oil futures have fallen in the morning's trading on the New York commodity exchange by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by over $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell earlier this month to almost $90 per barrel, before jumping on a wave of huge financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congress Bureau announced that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history this weekend.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of progressive decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would purchase Wachovia Corporation's banking division.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments have partially nationalised the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
Barclays Capital's analysts said that the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the economic rescue plan "prove unable to revive the mood of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates, and exchange rates have become very uncertain," Deutsche Bank's analysts wrote in the report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is how far the American virus will spread around the world and especially China. "
This bank's analysts have limited their expectations to next year, as oil consumption has fallen due to slower growth in the economy, and have reduced their forecast of petrol prices by around 20% for 2009.
The wild ride in the second quarter surpassed the team record
After spending the last eight seasons in a Jets jersey more than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned the scot-free game into a fun ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had leveled their troubled game to the bleak clouds above them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly marked the afternoon in which their gradually evolving cooperation moved miles forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter behind two more touchdowns, including the one in which Cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before half the game.
"It was nothing special," Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We've been communicating well, no matter what people think. "
While Favre and Coles were tossing, the defense attacked the quarterback, the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and put it back 32 yards on the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and picked it up.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
Team Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal out of the field, giving him a 34-0 lead.
That's the most Jets ever got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was called upon to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter, or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
Many points fell in a short period of time. "
Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, when on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon he broke his own world record and became the first person to run a 26.2 mile long race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning a pleasantly flat track at 2: 03: 59, he rolled his previous time by 27 seconds, 2: 04: 26, which he ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or is at least the world champion at all distances from a metric mile to a marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was afraid - perhaps too frightened in retrospect - that the polluted air would upset his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on the start, 55 degrees in the finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What line runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have focused on longer lines, the marathon record in the past decade has fallen by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won Berlin at 2: 06: 05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the break got him up to speed before she held up.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselassie to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
A week ago, I started over, and I was in a little bit of doubt today, but everything was fine. "
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - because he said he was overplanning his races, generally avoiding world marathons, relying on conductors as if it were a track race, and building world records beyond the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running qualities.
Maintaining the pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie half in time 1: 02: 04.
After the conductors passed out, two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi were constantly chasing Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie took over and escaped Kwambai, who then ran second in time 2: 05: 36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in time 2: 07: 48.
In the race of women she completed an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2: 19: 19 Irina Mikitenková, a native from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2: 15: 25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitenková, surprisingly, won the London marathon last spring at 2: 24: 14 p.m.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something that was described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race wisely and wisely: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big jump and then dragged them about 18 ½ miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia ran second in 2: 21: 31 and Helene Kipová from Kenya finished third in 2: 25: 01.
The pride and obstacles of the life of black people in a separate city
Hidden among the larger Orlando theme parks, a few miles from anything shiny, noisy and giant, lies a quiet city in which pride and the difficulty of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city, which was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of quava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Zora Festival to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains on the sidelines, even though she made it a tourist stop by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It's still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and shared their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many residents remain cautious about foreign views.
"We pay close attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and a community of almost 2400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but also an oak tree shielded by an example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that came from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of dialects like "Mules and Men (1935)" and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937)."
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide have turned the city into road 17, which leads through the often passing center of Florida, the stage of black history and human drama.
With the thrust of the big drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers into the store of the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left next to the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained yards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash, and she wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into an hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to the self-government, but also illiteracy, re-marriage and sex.
This clearly wasn't a typical publishing house, Fodor's.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a spry eccentric, which she often returned to after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she came into town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevy, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of decent dressing.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Franklin, but many were smirking.
"People always liked to see Zor," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, the contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no bigger funeral ceremonies or big public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood the importance of the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, the author of the Hurston biography "Wrap in Rainbow" published in 2003.
The change came in the '80s.
Orange County County officials wanted to stretch the city through a five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-lane main road.
Orlando's spillage has already pushed interstate highway 4 through the west edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at the people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw a melon out of the car. "
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court for forced integration and declared his decision in the Brown case against the Chamber of Education that "it is offensive to my race rather than celebrating."
The population now claims that the desegregation of schools, even though it was positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the young people here.
"Black children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until teachers and pupils came from the same place, added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, have helped to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with reckless self-esteem and quotes such as "How can someone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand. "
In 1975, Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to revitalize her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston's praised biography of Robert E. Hemenway, who re-classified it in the American canon, came to the shelves in bookstores.
The freeway project arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the lights of the ramp again.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to its motorway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many come back to celebrate.
After a few years, the state has retreated from the highway design.
"The five currents of the highway were resurrected, you would say it had detonated directly, a genuine civic pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said it more easily, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Winning a highway project helped change the city's image.
Extraurban people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the church in 1993, started showing up in larger numbers, and the residents started rethinking the past.
Eatonville joined the national historical registry in 1998.
The new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a backwater alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today it's 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to search for the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
The permission for most interviews must be given in advance and certain things - such as wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church painted by white people and depicting black people in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a brave, confident teacher who likes deep red, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival got bigger, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, a sincere love for the community sounds when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or police department that he says would use some help.
And even younger, like the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, they seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, think," Hm, this town is nothing against the others, "said Alondra Kenon recently after church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
We all speak fluent financial here in New York.
Nothing's changed here at first sight.
If the tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from the newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that every day, in a glazed beehive of offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York have had the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rattling metal trucks on the sidewalks, carrying muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
Hispanic still moves between the towers and wears, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts hanging from the balance-scales on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it's still impossible to get a yellow cab on weekday between 4: 00 and 7: 00 p.m.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until I decided, with all the talk of pessimism, to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this assignment to cover up with a late afternoon siesta at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were already about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of cash windows to pick up or save cash, but in front of a counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask about the way to the Macy's mixed goods store, and new customers open their accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my licensed personal banker, came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already selected their savings from smaller banks where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have collected money from so-called threfts (a little like building savings banks), money associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate only in one state and which claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly failed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion asset bank, went into bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers returned home on a Friday night weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops that were standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their cash into a bank that is perceived as a safe haven, and that makes most of the saving on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent financial over the past week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and to her skinny executive Dick Fuld with such familyness as if she were talking about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed, about 50-year-old landlady, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I won't take any chances. "
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing side of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing side of Vlaams Belang, takes part in the manifestation presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to the organization "Cities against Islamization."
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed out by the red line.
The police are accusing right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extremely right-wing parties have made huge profits in universal elections.
Over 90 graves in a cemetery in Traun town near Linz were badly damaged between Friday night and this morning and the police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols on some graves, such as David's star, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the elections.
A spokesperson for the Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the reports of desecration that came at the close of the Muslim moon Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria enters the cycle of searching for its own soul after the traffic went up in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both extreme right-wing parties, which gained more than 30% of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, who received over 18 percent of the votes, protested against scarves and burqs in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to food that is perceived to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent Islam from rising.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that this change was mainly due to young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't go on a trip across the border
Gary Glitter, the glamrock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, banned the court from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police agreed to this travel ban last Thursday after she handed over evidence of Glitter's past sentences for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, in his own name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's Lowest Criminal Court, a court-martialled spokesman said: "On Thursday, the Kent Police requested a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally participate. "
64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, as a record of sexual assailants imposes on him.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also forward the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he omitted to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A Kent police spokesman said, "The Kent police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to track someone who stays in Britain, because we have large-scale systems that manage potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the population of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police, and we are working very carefully to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual assailants in order to minimise any danger to the public. "
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London, and at the same time, Scotland Yard successfully requested an order to register as a sexual assailant.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
The source from the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and pleased that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I'm taking pictures of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, separated from the focus on interpretation - I will only achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the second - human.
Inseparable, aside from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a slightly captured view, or the passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to appear on the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in the "Flamenco-people" theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less well-known face of masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from various environments.
The exhibition, which takes place under the Flamenca Photography Month programme (Mes de la Photographía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenca," says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" can be any person, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people who are portrayed "on the street" are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivate the audience.
It is not necessary to take pictures on stage to capture the personality of these artists.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
Enchanted by the festival "Cante de las Minas" Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portrait flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on the board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble a classic photograph.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classic base of the film and gives it the present spirit, an idea which, according to Bauer himself, is reflected by flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which continues to surprise and evolve."
What tears the audience apart is not the action of the dance itself, the singing or the game, but the personality and character of the artist.
Finding the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is the constant work presented during these days in the El Fotomata Gallery.
This selection of almost 70 photographed artists is made by famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenca and will soon get a book edition, which will contain exhibited portraits.
The passion for portrait led Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea on "Portraits of Sports Veterans" two years ago.
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "taking pictures of people, getting to know them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think in the photograph, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or meets people, personalities he sometimes doesn't even know, or they only give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas. "
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "boldness"
It takes place in an environment that he does not yet know and tells about events for him unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and travelled in the Amazon.
The eternal favourite of the Nobel Prize for Literature was admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing him "is boldness," and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I would not do it, but I will, and I believe that I will one day finish it," concluded his contribution to the exchange of ideas, ideas and words that he saw in the city of aqueduct around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in four days.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the festival of words and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had before him a dedicated audience, whose hour of time ran by like water - a Peruvian with an amazing precision and a great amount of humor remembered how, from the original "incredible adventure" of the "pleasure of a passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than I had" born a literary mission; how the "lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplined," carefully corrected and rewritten, or how they influenced his writing, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "memoirs" are the basis of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, fleeting experience" - he stressed Vargas Llos, saying that he "acts on people" and "forces them to try to get out of line," and called on writers to "not subject to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their mission.
Because of climate science, he's losing the festival in Pozoblanc - the lance is missing
The performance with copies, which concludes the festival in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement by the performers that the square's surface was not in good condition.
That is why the company, together with Fermin Bohrórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfighting.
The unfavourable weather conditions have plagued this festivities for a long time, two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain made it impossible for the second bull fights to take place.
During them, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to stand up to bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
But this is the only way to celebrate on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically good performance was carried out on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon Alejandro Talavante swapped two shots with a spear for greetings and one ear, brought to him by the unopened seats in the arena rather than the Toreador art.
Even worse, El Juli, who walked through the Los Llanos Bull's Arena, was unsalty.
In the second round of hard work without a break, he earned a sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They got out of control in Álava in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hash.
Ten minutes to five.
Ertzaintza road inspection in the district of Armiñón (Álava).
Members stop two people driving in a van and they miss them.
The cargo, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to a report from the Basque Government Interior Department, they were persecuted and detained by one of the persons in the van, a man 38 years old who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee has been charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a road inspection on N-1 at the places where they crossed the border of the Armiñón district.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated and fled.
Members began to prosecute the car immediately, until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few miles away, at which point both passengers jumped out and took off into the woodland.
Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of them and seized 2 178 kilograms of hashish that the suspects were transporting, as it turns out when they searched the Iveco Daily brand.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were then transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of drugs.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "wrinkled" and did not agree with the information contained in the delivery documents, so the detained was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues the search for the second suspect, who, as has already been mentioned, has managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the drug seized.
Detained A.A.J., 28 years old, has been transferred to the police department to carry out proper formalities before further investigation is carried out.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, popular Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
The witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito, told People magazine spokesperson for California Road Patrol.
The witness stated that around 4: 30 p.m. Locklear "stepped hard on the gas, drove forward and backward during loud roaring and tried to leave the parking spot - she passed her sunglasses several times in reverse."
The witness, who apparently didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear just after she was stopping on the nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because she was "worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the members took her to a specialized drug and alcoholic center to undergo a test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress was cooperating and excessive alcohol was then excluded, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was obvious to the officers at first sight."
Locklear was apprehended on suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7: 00 even though she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association of IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The General Chief of IU and the Member behind the United Left, Gaspar Llamasares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former Council Department of Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of acting for the benefit of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am too federalist to do so, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its authority," indicated Llamazares' actions to which the party will have to proceed in relation to a former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of IU insisted that, in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" was absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought to ensure that such matters are as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions."
"Flower Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), to which he was inspired by the Episode of the National Past of Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous rebellion of the Spaniards against the French - the most ambitious film in his film with a budget of around EUR 15 million.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw the eloquence of the characters and analysis of the company," which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of interpreters.
May blood with a meter of over two and a half hours will be introduced to the cinema this Friday and in the future is going to be more than a four-hour series for telemadrid television.
As a great admirer of Galdós José Luis Garci's literary work, he claims to have achieved a "childhood dream" by making this film, which Esperanze Aguirre, who three years ago appointed him for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to make a picture for the two-hundred anniversary of the Madrid on May 2, accepted the offer to be based on the Episode of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has made a complete contribution, means a "unique opportunity for Garcia" to create an environment with sets and costumes corresponding to the image of "the trembling Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for which the struggle for independence led Ferdinand VII. to the decline and backwardness of the country," he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support that has been given to the Sad Wings (Ala Triste) or Goya's phantoms - almost twice the blood of May - so he could not shoot some scenes from the script signed by Horacio Valcárcela, with which he works almost all over his film track.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezzar) works as he is commonly used to - on the scene with actors he usually rehearses before filming and does not choose casting because it seems "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is, among other things, to go to theatres and cinemas and to learn what happens in the craft he deals with."
Many actors that he chose for May blood appear before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four nominations for Oscar, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billion and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it has yet to appear."
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for what happens next, but then you realize you're only working for the profits, so you submit to making one more movie," explains Garcia with more than a 30-year-old director's career.
Isabel Bayon revives the spiritual legacy of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
Seville flamenca dancer pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valenciao, from the father of Catalan (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, she moved to London with her family.
She danced a modern dance and focused on oriental dancing.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she fought for the abolition of a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, has bewitched Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about taking the soul.
The names of her dance shows reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "butterfly dance" evokes me guajira or "snake dance" some thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetics also corresponded, "she claims.
The performance involves two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Vedda, who will sing Isabel in one performance as well as in the "Open Door" (La puerta abierta), and with the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to work with her former pupil.
"Matilde presents the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she has accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me. "
The performance also includes music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of the actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artists, who are prima donna with all the world and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place for a period of time in places as far away as India, the United States, or Russia, and throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but now no one knows her and even less appreciates her creation," says Bayon.
The performance starts today at 8: 30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "Journal of the Newly Married" also closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "New Year's Day" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón (2006-2008), organised to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
The "Zenobia Triennial and Juan Ramón Triennial" is coming to an end with the new release of this work, the international congress, which will be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The sun ray," opened in May of this year, and after discovering various Andalusian provinces, should be moved to New York according to the plans at the time of the congress.
The cultural council of the autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "New Married Diary" modified by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue the dissemination of awareness of the personality and work of one of Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other that much anymore.
"Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them. "
These are the words of the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Intensity," and under the weight of knowing that Newman had left, revealing his dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And he's retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be severely ill.
Still, he was a big man to all of us.
"Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better because of it."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American confidence is at its bottom, when there are desperate reasons for pride.
When times are tough and people without virtues and just a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration, there's no need to be Luis Cernous to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from a foundation against drug addiction based on the honor of the firstborn son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that has spent a great deal of effort to get away from a suicidal eating culture.
A turbulent wave of admiration has flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar holder for Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the highlight of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his biggest source of inspiration.
"The fox has put a pretty high bar on all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman - he's based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, there are people like that, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he's been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who he was loyal to, although he certainly had more than enough opportunity not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
May he be accompanied by pride in heaven for there is a union between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was proudest in the role of devoted husband, loving father, willing grandfather, and dedicated philanthropist."
Imperfect Olympic Madrid races
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the failed year 2012, it will be possible 2016.
But I'm asking: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my opinion, he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense that if it came to evaluation and I was an examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
The nonsense begins with picking up the racing number, which is why you have to leave early.
That doesn't sound bad to me, but when you go in there, get them to give you everything (including a chip to prevent overloading the track).
Oh, no.
Here you had to first pick up the number (the first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after putting out the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (the second nonsense, because I need the size XL).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they have only chosen to buy small T-shirts because it is less fabric and is cheaper?
Well, that's a little something compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go for the chip very soon and the queue lasted over 15 minutes, the backpack had to be handed in.
It took more than 35 minutes to wait, which is at a race where 11 000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't put our backpacks down yet, and when we did, the pick-up was much worse.
Moreover, the waiting was extended by 40 minutes by rain, leading to a general revolt and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some like me will not show the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I assume, did not get the time of launch right.
Of course, if someone had asked me about some perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
So I guess we'll just have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft showed further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in the manner of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling for a taxi (or Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire area of the company) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they're wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort the present by conversion groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that he is not part of the group that talks to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see someone, and she's telling her she'll be with her in a minute.
All without a blue death screen.
Gorgeous.
But that, of course, is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers only had the necessary, without a burden of commercial needlessness, they'd be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder when considering that Microsoft version from version adds new features to Windows and other "extra."
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who opted for the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer of understanding between hardware and software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and to more Internet browsers.
The computer turns on to trigger Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time every day on the Internet than around windows.
What is the use of half the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering his services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a little example.
I took this photo in a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft's employees were using Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let us not count on 2010.
In Microsoft, they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azur coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in the "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the "Godfather" of Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the list of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscle with a pointed moustache that lifts weights in a traveling circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton man's undershirt, clingy and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out over everyone else.
First of all, because of his obnoxious name - although it is called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport because, as legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' stands out for other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost unnoticeable) Belgian flag, with models of the most delicate tank tops as a detail around the neck.
And beware, because a Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
They also make sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, sailor T-shirts, baby clothes, mini shorts...
A thought-out piece for a comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. I don't care who the father is."
A great resemblance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are taking their new fashions very seriously now.
It means a lot more to Monica than just that some pretty, famous girls lend their name.
In Paris, Mango participated in a promotional event held at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most significant fashion prizes that this Spanish company is sponsoring.
She's both warm and shy, and she's gonna get you up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango this year's autumn-winter season, and I also took part in the announcement of the second year "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentina.
So it's been a tough day, but it's also been an exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love '50s and' 60s movies, and we've been drawing a lot of stimuli out of them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around dressed, combine and fold their clothes, that's what I do very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I mean, I liked my clothes since I was a little girl, and I still wanted to go to my grandmother's house, go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the fair.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to keep an eye on the way I dress.
You know, we dancers are based on how we're adjusted to feel good about our classes and rehearsals looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you actually get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 the other day, did the crisis hit you?
No way.
I feel better than I've ever felt before. I enjoy my 30s.
I find that my wife is done, she has experience, and life enjoys it with less mistakes.
Biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father's concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I'm gonna give my kid a feeling of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As far as the movie goes, there's a couple of movie premieres you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to them coming to the movies.
I come from the theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, and I want everything right now, and of course I can't.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo."
Let's see how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the runway next to Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm gonna go stand on the pier like a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to take part in a benefit show for her organization "Women for Better Life," and the clothes we've been showing - I've also selected two models from our Mango collection - have been auctioned off, and the proceeds have been passed on to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of talk about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity purposes, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it, too.
For the benefit of the women of the third world, I will do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car to prevent him from starting a drunk car or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known as early as June of this year and is now included in the Annual Report of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its aim is to return the driver behind the wheel, which is why the drivers will also have to take a course in transport reeducation.
In addition to the National Office for Transport Security, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Technical Institute for Car Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of car drivers accused more than once for drunk driving will again get behind the wheel in this condition.
Alcolock should prevent this from happening because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting up if the driver does not breathe before, or if it is recorded above the permitted concentration of alcohol.
Its price exceeds EUR 1 000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with this equipment decreased by 65% during the first year since the introduction.
In Spain, 115 people are expected to be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
In order to help its implementation, since legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary rules on criminal provisions require a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE proposal (the Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peephoes"
With British precision, at 17.40 hours, as it stood in the program, a plane of Spanish air forces arrived in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in México D. F., where the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just set, but its rays had so far forced their eyes to be closed so that a subsequent pair could be seen coming out of the plane.
Under the steps was the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish prince and princess were coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, that's great, it won't be able to get to the airport at that time to pick up people... she's from here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
But the Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just outside the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honest salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, very moderately dressed and with her hair torn, does not have her usual "peeptoe," apparently reported to her that there was a storm in D. F..
Before they go to the hall, where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose for them unnecessarily.
At the door of the hotel where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a chatty Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
The best subsidised fashion price
Perhaps there is no better place in the world to declare a fashion prize than Paris, and perhaps it is not a more excellent designer and bonvied than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised by EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, first-year winner, looked at her designs in Mango's window on Haussmann Street in Paris, number 54, and almost cried with milking.
Of course, it is the second largest business in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for taking the chair of the competition jury, have led us to dine in the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango's ceremonially decorated table looked even more amazing next to Chagall's most excellent works.
Nati, with a heartbroken grief due to her brother's recent death, wore this mark and ELAH jewelry, over which he hid his breath, and hung into his son Luis - a nearly two-metre-long elegance - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took up the welcome, and as a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild remained without a jacket because they were both offered to two ladies.
Monika Cruz, who arrived at the store in her own hand-designed pants and shirt and changed into a long, black, sexy dress for dinner, touched the night walk around the Opera with Goya Toledo, showed us the hall for ballet exams, and at other times she grabbed one of the bars and indicated "grand plié."
Inés Sastreová did not stay for a tour of the palace's nearby buildings, but before leaving, she showed us photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no fragrance should be used in his rooms.
Stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - counter-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and furious everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they're all summarised in one book that brings a relax to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm rings every morning at 7: 00 a.m. as punishment, but even worse, to imagine yourself consumed by the rush of the rhythm that brings life to the present day.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there is not one or two methods to combat everyday exhaustion and the difficulty of untying yourself from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, apart from the yoga position, classic massage and spa therapy on the pages of her book, gathered the entire "menu" options, adjusted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The stress book is called "1001 way of relaxing," and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, it brings peace to the bookstore.
If anyone considers it impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "guide" denies this view.
In addition, it offers additional procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but it's actually meaningless.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquia.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure they told one of you that he spoke in his sleep last night.
This can occur very sporadically (for example once in a lifetime in high fever), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There's not just one reason to explain her entrance.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, enuresis nocturna or sleepwalking, but may not be the case.
As has been mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stress or bright situations.
In any case, this is a low-level phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
A child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or on the contrary (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe and consult with an expert to see if it has any problem that causes great anxiety and thus manifests itself.
We said it was a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
What we can do, however, is to remember a few very simple preventive measures such as:
Trying not to upset the baby too much before she goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent television programs or shows.
In very nervous children and those who can work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them get some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
When somniloquia appears, try to remain calm.
Remember, she's harmless to the child and she won't remember anything from what happened the next day.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's not conscious, and it'll interrupt his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and therefore he rests.
Remember, if it seems to you several times in a row that he is very troubled, it would be advisable to take advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If he understands what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and pull information from him.
It won't do any good, because when he sleeps, he's not conscious to get his mind together.
Plus, you'll hear what he's saying, but you don't know what he's dreaming about, and that's why he's saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come up with.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Just don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally, after a long, thin period, found his way to victory again.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellowish had more chances and were able to change one of them victorious.
The game did not have too fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers were hard to enforce.
After the first attempt by the captain to host Kauffmann, who had barely missed the clutch, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defence of Dannemarie.
The opponent, by contrast, built a defensive wall in half the field and left only agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well situated for processing the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53 ').
Gólman Illhaeusern, however, did not enjoy joy for a long time, after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room to leave his teammates in weakness.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to make a profit from this, and to the 11th of Illhaeusern, who had only withdrawn a little to "thicken" the defense, did not cause any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the game, when the ball flew very close to the harvest after the big mess.
Sarkozy is going to meet angry fishermen
Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany before he leaves for the United States.
In order to face a demonstration of the force of fishermen, who strongly undermined the accessibility of several Bretton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to Guilvinec port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped to "come up with concrete proposals."
The President's visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "Crisis Committee" created by the Breton fishermen to take action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak above an average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elysian Palace spokesman David Martinon, the President "will speak to them" about solutions that can be imagined in order to help their firms regain competitiveness and better ensure conditions for the employment and payment of seafarers. "
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they performed a "snail" operation (slow-moving vehicle operations) in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing nearly 10 km of constipation.
The Quiberon Recreation Port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, a filtration dam was set up.
Sailors showed their determination on Monday, when they were burning tyres and pallets in front of fuel stores in Brest and Lorient at dawn, while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were taking place.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel la Manche, like the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until they decide to act themselves by Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "Crisis Committee" is to decide on Tuesday on how to continue the journey and on its participation in the forthcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some of Breton's fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Fisheries Department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not abandon anything" and "do not want to come to Paris," for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Department, declared.
The professional fishermen who do not pay the oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but consider that the ship's profitability threshold is only reached when the oil is below EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, bowed to the legend of the film and the politically involved actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying this year on the supply of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of a recession that is soaring over the world economy.
The fourth aerospace engineer in the world, Embraer, maintains his supply assumptions for 2008 with 215 devices supplied, confirmed by his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian engineer promises a great deal from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients in the range of eight years.
AIG says he's thinking of handing over 15% of his assets.
The insurer of the American International Group, who was put above water by the US monetary authorities, is considering advancing more than 15% of his assets in order to pay back the $85 billion that he was given as a deposit, writes in the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance policies in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying a journal that quotes resources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to France Télécom, the AIG Board met on Sunday during the evening to examine any referral.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the reinsurers of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, are provided by France Télécom.
No final decision on these transfers has been taken yet; France Télécom continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to pay back the $85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve at the risk that the US authorities will confiscate 80% of its capital, thereby cutting it into a proper ratio of its current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the Historical Meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
On 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the largest point drop in its history (684,81 points) has been recorded.
The Nasdaq index with the prevailing technological component lost, according to the definitive data after the trading deadline, 199,61 points and stabilised to 1,983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Wicked since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally failed to reject the rescue plan by the House of Representatives, a plan that was supposed to allow a little stability to be found in the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide Henry Paulson with the Treasury Secretary the funds he requested.
Almost two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market which sees that Congress is unable to accept a specific plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days would not be "too late."
"If this project is indeed doomed (...), the relay will be handed over immediately to the Fed (US Central Bank, NB) and to other central banks in order to eradicate the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, the leading economist of Global Insight.
And, with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that in the United States, "every new day brings the fall of one financial institution."
After the Friday's collapse of Washington Mutual, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia Bank's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly regained momentum and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are "not only dealing with the US crisis, but with the global crisis," an analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The proceeds from the 10-year cash order fell to 3,632% compared to 3,827% on Friday night, the return to 30 years to 4,161% compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, which was to find out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The leadership tents of the Republican and Democratic campaigns were not surprised when they both announced their victory in the television duel that watched a third of America's families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent he was, was not "brilliant" enough to stop him, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion polls published on Saturday give Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), considers that the democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of those questioned, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% attaches victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted, "said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that..." repeated accusations were made.
"I do not think Senator Obama has sufficient experience and knowledge to become President," he also assured.
In such an offensive spirit, there have been Republican TV spots since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and he turned out to be brief and precise.
He raised his ability to take the right decisions and restore the reputation of the United States to the world.
"McCain still failed to understand, while Obama did," he replied on the weekend to a democratic spot accusing the Republican of not taking sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on the "ordinary American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered at the election meeting in North Carolina in a violent rain.
Nor has he uttered words like "middle class" or "working class." The financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"Next week could be a decisive turn," estimated yesterday by the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as George Bush conducted it and supported by Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator once again confirmed that, despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, 95% of Americans' taxes should be reduced, and he also pointed out that the implementation of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is its number one priority, along with the implementation of the health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided the issues concerning the financial assistance plan of $700 billion (€470 billion), which was adopted last night by Congress and which is strongly unpopular.
"Have you noticed that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after closing the election rooms at the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregular elections to the parliament.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: 'dictator, demise'.
Some admit that they didn't even go to the election: "What good would it do if they did what they want with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to take a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the elections were considered to be pure by the observers.
According to the opposition, that was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census," said Juri Potemkin, spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," points out Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who sums up the votes, and in our country it is executive power.
If any opposition Members enter Parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills' proposals.
The opposition therefore feels obliged to take part in the political functioning, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be launched.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate for Russia.
However, we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the course of the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there have been elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There was no foot in the polling rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition Members in Parliament, those who are most suited to the regime. "
The night's silence was once again hosted by the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Yesterday, Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased because Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the '80s and' 90s.
As is widely known, the National Blood Reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusions Department was contaminated by the HIV and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In February 1994, in view of this drama and the wave of indifference to the public, the Canadian Government launched a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever was stalling to submit a report, some provinces have set in motion a committee aimed at planning a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Québek, the Gélinea Committee held this role.
Following the Gélineau and the Krever report, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be managed by Québec, and the Canadian Blood Society for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec started his activities in 1998, hardly 38% of people still had faith in the Quebec blood system," says Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
With consistent efforts to increase the safety of blood products and permanent work in this area over the years to come, we have gained public confidence again, "he says and proudly adds that almost 94% of the Québec population had trusted Héma-Québek in early 2008.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile."
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
"At that time, we saw many cases in Europe of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says the woman who has been leading the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread with blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report that, if we do not know this and if the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterised by degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, an exclusion measure must be taken.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who have been in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, this disease was safely proven to be transmitted through blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the principle of prudence. "
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow the detection of the presence of the virus itself in donor blood and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests used previously were based.
The NAT tests have allowed a shortening of the deaf period between the moment of infection and the moment when the first viruses in our blood can be detected, explains the specialist.
We have managed to shorten this period to less than a week.
In doing so, we have substantially reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without finding out.
These improvements have enabled a significant reduction in the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusion.
One person in 12 million is exposed today to the risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years for the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary to heal, "says the head of Héma-Québek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of morbid element could appear in the system.
Just last year, a Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by a sting of insects.
It is important to be vigilant at all times, 'Dr Décary continues and stresses that, in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also expect sufficient supply.
"Needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Québecans allowed to donate. "
Any healthy person aged at least 18 years, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where there are mud chills, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that matches the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, donor members should be supplemented in proportion to how old they are and no longer able to donate blood.
But convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unfettered today, we rarely find an hour to donate blood, "Francine Décary gets laid.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Hema-Québek, which also manages a single public bank of blood from the umbilical cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, has blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood samples from the umbilical cord into the bank, and we expect to collect over a thousand of them a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants, "says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Héma-Quebec does not have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Québek.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarter finals played on the total number of goals qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL division, thanks to the 3: 1 win (4: 3 is a goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders from Seattle.
Backup Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90 minute game.
After the two-sided goal-free first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino added the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Let's remember that Friday during the first of the two games, Impact in the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle suburb, suffered 2-1 defeat.
Impact measures in the semifinals of its power with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, Thunder settled the 3: 1 deficit in the home game and finally won 4: 3, Whitecaps nevertheless advanced to the semi-final round with a total of 5: 4 goals.
Impact should meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, however, the details of the series of matches will only be confirmed today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attack troika of Canadien is ready to begin the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekance and Andrei Kostin last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win the Canadian 3: 2 on separate raids.
Kostocin, the biggest star of the meet, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists and Kovalev harvested one pass in this fourth win of the three-colour of the six preparatory games.
Kovalev ensured victory by scoring a single goal during the separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need one more game to make me feel good."
"He tried too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice round of applause. "
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year.
Just after the Liberal Party Congress (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Québek, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running today's supplementary election.
"To move the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually intriguing way at the end of the Québek Liberal Party Congress in Lévis, without, however, giving details.
During his speech, pictures were shown behind his back in some kind of image grinder.
On three giant screens ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dam, down, Québek from "Google Maps," maps, etc.
Generous means, just like in the pre-election period.
In fact, at the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out early elections in autumn, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The "Plan North" is the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, the vision of the "new economic space," which includes the agreement with France on labour, the agreement between Canada and Europe, and the agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of North - Northern Territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his declarations, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "gem with huge potential," but it did not mention the term, the amount of investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned a number of approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular, hydropower plants, forests, but above all, the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
North, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This "territory twice the size of France is with us," it's in Québek.
And it is not only with us, but it is within us, "he stressed as if he wanted to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, highlighted by the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Québec engineering, James Bay.
"It is ours, it is our future," he added after he had theatrically silenced himself to look at a huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of the territory of Québek, includes part of Labrador, which Québec has always requested, has been specified by the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all existing governments.
There is one border line that has long been absent from the Convention, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, in the name of the government, I will retake this position, "he suggested.
Otherwise, "our vision of the North needs to be reconsidered in the context of climate change," he said, when he spoke of the crossing of the north-west, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially to the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist Member of Ungava), have already started negotiations with about 30 communities.
The work was launched by an interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "a common vision will be set out."
Moreover, the development of the North should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a fluent follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals that preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Indeed, this was one of the ever-shaken topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's ascension to the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted suggests that Beauharnois's headquarters be rebaptised to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out a peaceful revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to the Bourassa, which created James Bay, our party was able to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, for the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam power station, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm only saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided in his member base, giving him a big round of applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching elections in the autumn of this year, which is permitted by law.
However, he stressed that his program was loaded, especially by a mission by the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekend convention provided a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular some "attempts to amend the constitution," which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Québek Liberal Party) requires in particular recognition of the "specificity of Québek" in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have the right to veto in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
From the opposition side, the North Plan was accepted sceptically in its main features.
The PQ (Parti Québecois) Chief Pauline Marois has once again taken out the Northern Québek Development Policy, which was launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal Government came to power in 2003, it waived the implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck to it, 'we would have stayed on today', Marois noted her candidate at Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"However, we wish it not to be a mere theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumont, who is returning today from the holidays.
Letters - Worthy country
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "Justice" (Oh Ironically) in Harper's Cabinet, who, in the summer of last year, took the liberty of saying that Louis Arbour is a "disgrace" to Canada.
To humiliate a woman who has led a constant struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, that says a lot about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all Western participating countries, has not brought back to its home a national who has been locked up in a Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that, at the time of the actions that he was being accused of, Omar Khadr was a juvenile adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier to rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty international, and in particular the Association of Canadian Lawyers, are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can look forward to a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little does it matter that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, undoubtedly permanently, after so many years of torture.
We do not realize this, but we are now witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the words that Harper is so bent on, and which sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, imprison him according to the approval of the head of so far minority government (as will be the case after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party that proclaims virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was the reputation and the seriousness of our country.
Shame is in this renunciation, Mr. Toews, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold Orwell discourse
In a September 17 edition, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, the executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, it confirms that the world's largest gold manufacturer has initiated the prosecution of three authors and a poor little publishing house for libel in order to create a "transparent public debate" and is demanding six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for libel, but the law.
It is no surprise that Garver completely ignores this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate, to bring down anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and to fight in a highly unbalanced fight with an army of lawyers backed by almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Indeed, the tactic in these unbalanced struggles often lies in the destruction of the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will clog the other party's mouth and, moreover, scare anyone who dares to pursue this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its views to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate normally lies in the exchange of ideas and not in the wounds of the baton.
So mining companies were not enough to open their books, their documentation, and to establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and has refused petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world refers only to fat-paid lawyers, and not to all Canadians; that is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In a democracy, even the oppressors have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports the authors and publisher of Noir Canada, does so mainly because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to hear and assess Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many see as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be closed (as part of his prosecution of the "public debate" by the way, Barrick has just made an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce that they should stop using this term...).
Apart from the surreal Garver speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom of exploration and search for the truth that is essential to every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual activity itself.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without facing repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have created it if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has a right to an answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as is the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would restrict such a type of wrongful prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, eventually reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to slow down the financial crisis that has been looming Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of the elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized due to non-payment, and the right to monitor the level of wages paid to managers of rescued firms.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Chairman of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday minutes after midnight, after the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the Bush administration's representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis currently taking place on Wall Street," explained the democrat.
"This is a crucial point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption of American daily life will be huge," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, the negotiations have run to the maximum in fear of the effect of another investor default.
The designated time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to the negotiations later, and they both spoke for the agreement rather than failing to express their dissatisfaction at the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with the addition of an agreement on certain measures, in particular one aimed at enabling owners to maintain their residence, and of wage measures leading to the state of the saved firms' labor.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary, "he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, who was questioned by another station to vote in favour of the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features that I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which it will be possible to move forward.
It is simply unacceptable to choose inaction, "he said.
The aim of the 700 billion plan is to buy back the dues' dubious debts and risky and unsold assets of US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis unleashed by the collapse of the real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the decomposition of banks and financial institutions.
The fall in the first draft agreement of last week is the result of Republican Members.
Since the Democrats agreed that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty will only be guaranteed by the government, but not bought, there is a belief that the impasse is over.
In an attempt to bring the conflicting views of Congress closer together, a measure has been introduced providing that the government will be able to introduce new charges to help it recover its contribution if it has to take on losses for five years as a result of the programme.
The new plan provides for a deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in the rescue companies that will pay dividends to him in the event of profits, and which will be able to sell again when this is over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the foreclosure procedures related to the loans to which the plan relates, as well as to set limits on the amount of evaluation and compensation paid to the managers of the firms affected.
The leaders of the plan would like to put it to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts that have been made, it is not yet certain that their plan will have a green light.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project both in the Republican and in the democratic camp.
"It is clear that Washington cannot hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Financial Commission of the House.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money on taxpayers is not the answer. "
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, host of a group of congressmen called the "sceptics committee," presents the whole thing differently, but the same conclusion is reached.
"Four hundred esteemed economics professors, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too fast and carefully explore which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion (USD 2,9 billion) as a result of the crisis in risk loans for the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, among the twenty largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
That is what savers and households at times of uncertainty can appreciate. "
On the other side of the Channel La Manche, the British government seems to have started nationalizing another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (USD 75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to his announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy out the branches and accounts of British bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Has this American actor come out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and perpetual talents that were his own also diverted him from the power category that begets real stars.
But what a long-haul runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at 83 on his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, who he was like and for a long time was a rival on film screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often begets beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother of Hungarian origin.
Of these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it, the whole country saw itself in love with a self made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that in the early 1950s studied acting in Yale, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theatre, television and early in the movie.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed himself second at a 24-hour Le Mans race in 1979, while at the same time a sexual symbol, despite being a model couple with Joanne Woodward since 1958.
He also leaves the shady places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of his own show-business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has caused the film's lovers to be dizzy, while his big roles compete on the black screen of memories.
After that, he defects over half a century of constantly changing American seventh art.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who denies his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a hot roof, adapting Tennessee Williams from 1958, comes back to mind.
From a less ancient past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many more Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a tortured, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 Newman made a real acquaintance.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful billiard player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure portrayed in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him a single Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering through the ages, that was him.
And him again.
In his career, there are different epochs competing with each other.
The young know him mainly thanks to the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an untraditional hockey coach.
The fans reunited with him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Coen Brothers.
He then closed his career as Godfather of the Irish Mafia at Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends who left the craft quite soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its notions, pomp and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded him, not without humor, as "a live challenge of underplaying," in his performance he put too much pressure on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a platter, the profession was not always so tender.
But the first lovers were played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate people, whose decadence and revolt reflected in its perfect traits.
As director Newman, he revealed a few known aspects of his bashful sensitivity.
His film, Rachel, 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played a leading role, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He gave his son Scott, who he lost because of the overdose, a film of Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of shame and sadness.
In the influx of honours that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former teammate Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) regretfully said, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
The grandeur, the love of life, these are the main qualities of a dead actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he also leaves the great civil rights fighter, ecology, independent film, the adversary of Hollywood's decline.
We used to see his effigy on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which might have seemed rather tasteful, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Difficult Childhood.
So Newman, rather than being lulled by fame, became involved in society to the last minute.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here. "
And it was an honor for us to be allowed to watch the path of such a clear-sighted and magnificent American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was made in the Zuschlag & spol invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, a trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
In addition to other crimes, including forgery, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organisation which has caused extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecution, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often documented the performance of their tasks through fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and the government - roughly 65 million forints in total - went partly to the Treasury of Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the individual pockets.
The way it also informed the investigating office was that the money obtained in the public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration and the association's commitments were never received.
According to the prosecution, a large proportion of the invoices were false.
Forms for these invoices came from the Yózsefváros market, round stamps were produced in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of which companies the production of invoices was to take place were decided, among other things, on a tour along the north bank of Balaton, on which István Lados János Zuschlag sent.
According to his testimony, the first-named was supposed to be looking at guesthouses and restaurants.
In them he applied for accounts for his consumption, according to which the invoices submitted in the context of the competitions, including the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Authority of the Capital, were subsequently produced.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by István Lados with his partner András, the one who, according to our information, wrote the most frequent reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip," Lados saw a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering facility provided catering for a 90-member group from Biztos Pont.
But so many people, according to the company manager, wouldn't be able to fit into this facility at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer 2002 by the Jobb Jövőért, later on, was swarming with formal and content errors, and was issued by the Harmadik Évezredért.
The guest house in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet there were a hundred and thirty guests on the invoice.
However, the fillers of forms with a rich imagination overstated this even when they stated on the documents a company also engaged in hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor, documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear.
The head of Győző Farkas for hvg.hu stated that when he was summoned to the prosecution and they showed him invoices, he immediately knew that these were false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
As he added, apart from formalities, it did not agree that, according to the invoice, they had a hundred people, because they only have eleven rooms that do not have that much capacity.
In addition, the invoice also indicated catering, while their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The keen manufacturers of invoices were not convinced that the viewed Budapest travel agency only organised foreign routes, and that the invoice with cash payment, which also did not match the company's billing practice, was foolishly referred to as a travel brokerage service for Hungary.
Moreover, as was the case in the course of the investigation, VAT was also mentioned in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
The four documents issued by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, on the amount of VAT. The company's activities are not covered by the above 25% but by 15% VAT, in addition, the employees of the hotel exhibited only a printed invoice, but the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, "publishers" ruined the invoice, for example, by stating with one company, as it emerged from the investigation of the public prosecutor's office, as a road transport activity carried out by a company based originally on investment advice, which was not carried out.
The fact that invoices issued to the Budweutt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the XXI associations are false. Századi Kulturális Interesület and Biztos Pont were also revealed due to formal deviations - not corresponding to the invoice format and incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna K. S. or Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when the Fiatal Városért group was eating with it, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he had issued the paper.
The invoices were knowingly exhibited
The second group of invoicing are those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjuu Szocialisták.
According to the indictment, one of the accused Ludovic Györfi forced the head of Collab s. r. o. to issue a fictional account.
The company Biogate s. r. o also cooperated with Zuschlag and its associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlas and Vörösphenyő Associations with invoices worth about five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Nor did the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, but the organisations forgot to mention that in their documents.
The other group of invoicing companies are those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió s. r. o., engaged in fuel and motor vehicle trading, based in Budapest, but not located in the company.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the information found by the investigation, Kiskunhalas' company Cash Investment s. r. o., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has purchased these invoices.
The manager of this company was a man from Romania to whom Ivan Kubatov was to hand over his company documents in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted in the course of the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppa, and the Foundation of Budweutt and Harmadik Évezredért and had received their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatova, the Romanian masons were set up by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment ks. s.
In fact, none of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get a job.
However, the companies were of benefit to him because, at the request of Zsolt Szente's co-defendant, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to Atlasz and Y-Generació linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The state's attorney concluded that Kubatov came to 10% of the amounts on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generació and Szövetség and Modern Magyarország submitted proposals to the Mihalye Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public-service organisation of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 000 forints, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
TMA submitted five fictional invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a home search at the office of Arpad Kemecsey at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the process of producing invoices, as it has done in the prosecution.
It may be interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag himself decides to reveal everything.
His statement is not very detailed, and although he has already promised several times that he will interpret everything widely, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying much of the damage, 50 million forints, maybe the Socialists made a deal with him, and Zusi will take the fall.
Indeed, he may have been offended, since his request to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely placing him under house arrest, remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crime, who have done much greater damage that they have not yet paid, can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings they have conducted in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, the people in the eBay auction contest don't want to fall behind, so they'd rather pay a price too high.
Research was using an experimental auction to try to map the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers was betting, the other group participated in the played auction, with the use of the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method being investigated in the active regions of the brain of the test subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but when playing at an auction, the important element of which is to top the other side, a whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively in the losing.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to researchers, it is possible to explain how to avoid the sharp reaction of the striata.
To support their theory, members of the economist research team conducted a cross-cutting financial investigation.
Under different circumstances, three groups regretted one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would still get $15 for the reward.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost this money as well.
The difference between the two groups was therefore all in all that one was emphasized by the win and the other by the loss.
But the members of the anti-loss group were willing to go higher than in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the neurologist hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
These have so far explained the phenomena observable in the auctions of the joy of victory and avoiding risk.
Until the neurological imaging methods helped us solve the contradiction between these two theories by now having come to a third explanation, "said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the New York University Economic Faculty.
Hepatitis: when to find a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be 100,000, but only seven thousand of them are being treated.
The name hepatitis is a cumulative name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, including inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causes of the disease and the diseases they cause differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways depending on the underlying disease: hepatitis A and E through the digestive system (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D, and other viruses by blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travelers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after ingestion of an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
Thereafter, jaundice, light stools and darkens urine appear on the skin and on the whites of the eyes. The treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people around the world die of a more serious type of disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected person is treated medically.
Also hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected do not even know the disease agent is destroying liver cells maliciously, so the first symptoms will occur in many cases in 20-30 years.
This is why early prevention, the implementation of regular depistation is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
As the disease can demonstrate a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his / her general practitioner if he / she has noticed any sign of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is the world's Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time by organisations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its formation and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn't hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could facilitate the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how the belief in the God of the perception of pain affects man, informed the British journal Telegraph.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks while all observed the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that closely examines the human brain, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
Research is the first of a series of research that scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university take part in alongside academics.
The exact test was carried out by attaching to the left hand of the test subject a sparkle instrument that produced electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: the Sassaferrat Virgin Mary, dating back to the 17th century, and the Lady with Leonard da Vinci's French fries, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would bring about a certain state of piety for the believers, while Da Vinci's painting was chosen because they were not very different from the first and they found it to be a soothing impression.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during that time they received 20 electric shocks in four consecutive parts, while they separately watched the painting with a religious or general theme.
Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they were "taken care of" and "calmed down, they were filled with peace."
When watching a religious painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved through any powerful image even for atheists, only to find the right photo.
"We would have to find an image that they would perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," said the psychologist.
The Bishop of England, Tom Wright, welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases it will change our personality," said Wright.
After such excellent results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of believers if they had shown them some Madonna from Leonard or a painter of similar caliber.
Would a look at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
♪ You're what you share ♪
On its tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations they are taking and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics making parallel to Orwellian dark vision are concerned, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently expressed to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather even more personal information about users, which is necessary for Google's founders to stick to their original intention, which was: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to Google's debriefed representative, even after ten years of world labor, the company is only at the beginning of working with all information.
To ask what will be in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what work would be good for me?" - such seemingly simple questions, however, will not be able to answer software until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know that during the Internet search, search words are captured exactly, as well as what IP address they were searched for, and to which site they moved to after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, for example, users can retain their surfing history, can look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, which will generate in the long term findings adapted much more directly to them - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously mentioned and preserved.
What if my data are used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - they ask users who are afraid to look at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not evoke guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the search terms are not only captured, but may also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
Perhaps the most famous example of recent times was a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community pages established through it.
But Internet users who are concerned about personality rights could still rest in May when the company has successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI with the organisation for the protection of electronic rights: Google must not be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI even in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought for nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions, which it obtained with reference to the strengthening of the adopted child protection law, but failed to receive lists of search items of individual users, respectively complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
Google's opinion is so contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the provision of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be exposed to harm by using Google's services, and they oppose it with a revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, America's geek culture and its wild branch, gathering enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation of big companies, "corporations that are now booming," unlike his rival Microsoft, considered by Windows to be conquerors of the world, both fighting for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not require money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as a much more accessible, more youthful, "coolant" than the practice of an official software giant.
However, this can also be due to the fact that the geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which has brought with it just one of the most cloned keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than cooperation, that we deliberately leave traces and use the communication channels that we have, and although their scope is different for each other, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which records the music he has been listening to, all of which can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides that he can write a blog on which his latest photo gallery, which he stores on Flickr or Picas, will automatically appear.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which it comes out: a girlfriend in the morning looking at a flood of photos of common friends easily finds out who her deluded boyfriend was spending the evening with, or the company can fire its worker just because she shows her honest opinion about the leadership on her blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of private life has been completely reconsidered today.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind today's youth behavior.
And those who want to hide something or at least avoid a Google monopoly have the option (starting with Scrooggle, who uses Google's search engine, however, deliberately leaves no trace).
Many people, for example, are deliberately not registered on the community website to make it impossible to find them. Google's online application from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not build the best possible profile of us.
Public opinion is not too secretly expecting Google to show teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion), Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords / AdSense advertising areas threaten investment by advertising agencies, and services introduced at a constantly accelerating pace seriously make the lives of Microsoft, as well as numerous other software designers, difficult.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints causing a disturbing impression: for example, the top management has completely rejected employee protests after raising the cost of the company's kindergarten fee to twice the cost of any frequent daily meals, according to the company's management, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google still bowed down to the Chinese government in 2006 and, in terms of their agreement, filters out any finding that is conducive to good taste, or to the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never adverts new services in advance, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the next few months and years can turn the world around in new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines will become such that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is compiling a genetic database can then serve as a good source material for future generations of sci-fi writers, the famous Cory Doctorow novel "Scroogled" describes the future with Orwellian Reminescence, in which one can be easily removed with Google data only.
The two-time Ozd killer was helped to remove the traces of two young people.
Two young people were questioned by the police in a double homicide case in Ozd, suspected to have helped remove the traces of this crime, said the spokesperson for the High Police Directorate of Borsod County on Tuesday.
Persons who have been suspected have confessed to the activity and are currently being accused of aiding and abetting a crime.
Both young persons, according to the information of the MTI, are being prosecuted on the loose.
Aiding and abetting a crime is punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to five years.
A suspect in a double homicide in Ozd, a 23-year-old local male, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of committing a premeditated multiple murders for profit.
In the course of the investigation, it became clear that a 23-year-old young man owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay his debt, which is why he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a facility in Ozd, where he killed a man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was premeditated to commit a crime, which is also a testament to the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Both the weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100% stock package in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwig Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish Party, despite the fact that the Czechs of the Warsaw Stock Exchange had already excluded Prague Stock Exchange from the range of potential new owners.
The reason is the fact that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell 60% of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
Last week, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and he did not rule out the possibility that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholder agreement, approximately 90% of the shares could be sold off.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25% share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l., with 13.5%.
About the financial crisis from the perspective of European leaves
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading papers are already reminiscent of "the second 9 / 11."
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the US President, who is pressing charges against the Roman La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to sew his own party together to support that hastily paid bill, which aims to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second 9 / 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
In El Mundo's view, the world economy has brought its lack of political leadership to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system continues to rise, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the congressional vote, Washington is in danger of not offering a political resolution tool.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest changes in capitalism's history is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Until now, individual states can throw a life-saving ring at the rioting money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from failure.
But if other banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor further improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unify control of the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the posturing monetary institutions received more than EUR 100 billion, reminiscent of Vienna's Der Standard, which said that, like Americans, they would have to dig deep into the crisis, even European taxpayers, are increasingly real.
Until now, the European Union has not seriously addressed the crisis that rolls like a tsunami in the old continent.
"Paramedics" may not be waving hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if they set out firmly in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collision, if not imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
Bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair was inspired by engineers from Nissan bumblebees. It was about building a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan designed a biomimetic robotic control system of the BR23C type, a robotic mini car equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all rainfall.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety cover," explained Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technological PR and research and development.
Folded eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions.
To copy the function of the folded eye, engineers reached after the idea of a laser remote meter.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres ahead of BR23C in a 180-degree field of vision, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that is immediately transformed into an operation to prevent collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotic car starts to imitate the movements of the bee and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision, it immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver is going on in an entirely instinctive way.
"If this had not been the case, a robotic car would not have been able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and intrinsic layer of safety-cover, which is currently considered inevitable by the collision.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, in the case of a robotic car, only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifetime than lithium ion variants.
According to Ando, an instinctive, intelligent response is important, not a processing ability, the less data storage.
This mechanism shall only process and react to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so he is still using only a few kilobytes of memory.
It doesn't need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing an immediate avoidance technology that is estimated by Nissan to reach mass-produced vehicles within ten years.
Another possibility of application can be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the final destination after avoiding obstacles.
Damn dear child already has a name
The $700 billion economy package bill, which is to be split into several instalments and which aims to buy out poor bank loans, is already in writing.
In the first round, half the amount will be used.
After further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight American Eastern Time, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days' debate on a $700 billion rescue package, Reuters told us.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which only the drafting of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further action needs to be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8: 00 p.m. Washington time (i.e. on Monday at 2: 00 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first, and then the Senate will have its turn on the draft law hearing the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act to be established.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then they also welcomed the news of the agreement at the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night and we very much appreciate both parties' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
Indeed, the programme is different from the Bush administration's original proposal, in which it was intended to spend a total of $700 billion on the purchase of poor mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend up to half the amount of 700 billion in the first round, by using 250 billion immediately after the Congress decides on Monday, and by purchasing mortgage-backed securities that are classified as poor, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the president's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special corps, a member of which will also be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The spending of the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic under the law: it may at the same time purchase low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "toxic" loans.
The buy-out can take place both directly and directly, communicated by the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee of funds that provide cause for concern, for which the company will pay the price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend as much as $700 billion to meet the urgent demands of the US financial system, whether it be large-scale purchases of bad funds, insurance, or to prevent systemic risks associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank bosses who are in trouble waiting to help the state can count on the government to reduce their severance - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
They will only be restricted in certain cases, and these restrictions will depend on the way the Ministry provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys under the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on gold parachutes if the fallen directors of banks are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of a direct buy-in of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It must be added that already existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction concerns only new ones, which is intended to further stimulate participation in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history where there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of the Directors-General," said the President of the Committee on the Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the right of the State in the banks participating in the programme to acquire a stake will fall, reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the bank that is saved are on their feet, they can also make money on this transaction.
The draft plan states that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
There were, of course, voices expressing doubts about the plan on both sides.
"This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, because this will not protect taxpayers' dollars," said the Republican congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kapturo, believes that it was those responsible for Wall Street's collapse who insisted on adopting the provisions.

Next year, to the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around 12 January, the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, 'almost everything now matters only if an electronic system of authorisation of journeys or controls is built over the sea in time'.
At the same time, she pointed out that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to be registered before leaving.
As of today, the representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Central Cross with the star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary and will hold talks with foreign policy advisors from the presidential candidate, Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank rescue package
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both large American parties, have made the same assurances about their support for a $700 billion government bailout package, but they are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After several days of negotiations by Congress and administrative representatives, early Sunday morning was announced: a basic agreement was concluded on a bank rescue package.
The financial package, aimed at remelting the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree to be more suitable from both candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, at the same time as they came to the forefront of the economic issue, Obama gained some advantage again, and McCain's lead, which he secured after the Republican convention by nominating Sarah Palin as Vice President, disappeared.
On Sunday, Obama expressed the hope that the 700 billion package bill would be passed quickly by Congress at the Detroit election assembly.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) to your places, savings, the entire industry, the stability of the entire economy is at risk," he said before the 35,000-dollar crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas of economics obsolete.
McCain, in an interview provided by ABC, explained: "Everyone will be a little bit displeased (...) but doing nothing is simply not an option."
As the Republican senator said, the proposal includes the setting-up of a commission to oversee the Minister of Finance and the severance limit for the senior officials on whom he insisted.
Obama declared to CBS that McCain had no more significant role in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, House President Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives will be voting on the bill on perhaps Monday.
Overview of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so it analyses the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haider people are ready to rule Austria to prevent a rudo-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discovers the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution eats its fathers."
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades - and now these very modern citizens are turning away from them.
The rotation of the period is the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and thus Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising to CSU, but on Saturday the process that could be expected for almost exactly ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, that is, at such a time as the Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently implemented in this country and is eating up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong at the pace. Secularization, educational results, the settlement of Germans from the east and the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of possibilities, which also has visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more opinionated.
It is also clear that, in recent weeks, the CSU has been the most distant from the classical civil classes; people in a free profession, business workers, individuals with graduate and university education.
By doing so, CSU support has shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Viennese daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The chairmen of the parties are tenacious about the coalition ', addresses the confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
It wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the involvement of the SPS in its internal affairs.
It seems open to all negotiations, the Greens don't want to negotiate with the coalition yet.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the parties' chairmen did not get much insight into their cards.
Mr Werner Faymann, President, has confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
And he wants to show that cooperation between both sides is certainly possible - there is a possibility in some Länder and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor, was left open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted at every turn.
Repeating this is not an option.
Molterer responded carefully to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether or not his party chooses opposition or enters the coalition is still completely open to the party, these questions must be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
Once again, the President of the BZÓ Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent a rudo-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóková: A vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
In Paris today, the European equality summit, hosted by France, the current President of the European Union, began.
Lívia Járóková, a Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, as one of the main speakers of the expert debate in her message addressed to the plenary, has turned attention to segregation in education, as she is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their application.
The conference was launched - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
They met among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Press Office of the Fidesz Járóková Group, it pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that takes place in recruitment, the Roma are forced out of the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education, and due to poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education."
Járók also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to establish awareness of this context in the widest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more chance he will have to become a productive member of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through income taxes and excise duties.
"Roma are entitled to their citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and guarantee the removal of their low-quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, the coherence of the European Union is needed, with the emphasis on the objective and the negotiation, in order to speed up school desegregation processes immediately, this is, first and foremost, important in the proper application of existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"A vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities given to democratic space so that they can participate in Europe's future as citizens of the law," Járóková asked.
Everyone is guaranteed, in the sign of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', the objective of the European Summit of Equality, organised every year since last Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set out at the level of both Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: temporary pardon
The fate of Duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
The chairman of Erwin Huber and Earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a disastrous 17% vote loss, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, members of a highly criticised duo have been told that they will not cling to their positions with all their might.
So they tried to reassure the angry members of the faction and base, who, because of the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of its strength was sufficient.
CSU has been a "self-governing" of 18 percent of Germany's GDP in Bavaria for 46 years.
While conservatives in the southern Länder, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, remain in a high position, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of a reorganisation within the Party is that the Vice-President and Federal Minister for Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber, will also be a member of a narrow intelligence team, which will launch a probationary meeting on a possible coalition of Munich government with a liberal FDP, or with a right-wing Free Election Group.
It is ironic that on the Free Election candidate, Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to make a coup, came to the Assembly, but then they took a mercilessly short trial with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role will also be played for Stoiber, who until now has been spinning strings from behind, the former Prime Minister of the Earth and former Chairman of the CSU called the bitter day of his political career on 28 September.
On Monday Huber made a few snarky comments to the CDU address, he thought they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor if CSU, which played a major role in the 2005 national success, is somehow not on its feet.
According to Merkel, who was difficult to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD has achieved 18.6% of the weakest result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko: opposition - 110: 0
In the Sunday elections, not a single opposition Member made it to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the well-being and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the illegality that occurred in the census.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise elections.
Although the 110-member legislature of a 10-million-dollar country has been missing the opposition well for ten years, the opposition, under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections, was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who, following a change in the constitution, kept it in a debatable way in 2006 and for the fourth time, would "allow" several opposition Members to appear in Parliament.
The ODS has thus dropped the previously considered boycott.
Against the background of opposition expectations, Russia's increasingly economically dependent Belarus - which took credit to mitigate the impact of Russia's ever-increasing natural gas imports and contributed to making Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines passing through the country, wish to improve relations with the European Union, where, because of the Belarusian political establishment rated as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians do not receive entry permits.
The release previously pointed out that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive shifts and not on shortcomings - for example, the ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's Monday lightning report already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could in fact not appear in the press, especially that the opposition could not be present with the census.
At the same time, an improvement can be felt in the political system, according to the opposition: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow even in smaller confrontations, when he continues to refuse to recognise the sectioned South Ossetia and Abkhazia of Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is a united state on paper, has been considered independent for a month now.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but most importantly, there has been a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remain the case, even though "the power to embark on a meaningless parliament of a single member of the opposition" has been startled.
Looking at the opposition's results, he is not planning protest actions, rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, distribution is hampered by local authorities, but I can still see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly," said Milinkevich, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider the most properly and officially supported layer of pensioners.
"Due to the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'inducing the silence of the cemetery' collapses," says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian observers regarded elections as democratic.
The Head of Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, said to the Russian intelligence agency Rio Novosti that "people do not believe in words but deeds," so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been introduced on the arrival and exit of employees.
From now on, however, this new measure will work against cunning people, against those who inject themselves and then go out for coffee on business hours.
The new anti-sloth was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and Secretary General of the Council of Presidents by Mauro Masi.
"The revolving door - said Brunetta - is a tool for better work, better performance, more presentations and more services' specified by the Minister.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency will now open.
This is reformism ', which underlines Brunette.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation of all the Council Presidency buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections on the part of the staff, the Secretary-General affirms: "This was a common procedure with the workers and cooperation of all '.
In short, no more breakfast in the working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7: 00 in the morning."

in Rome, the Minister will finally announce that within three months the absence of public staff for the disease has decreased by 50%, i.e. by 60 000 more persons per year at work. "
And add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its payout dynamics - explained by the minister - have doubled over the past 8-10 years in relation to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage."
In the meantime, thousands of public employees have gathered to reject the standards of the Brunette Decree in accordance with the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Administration today presents figures about a lower absence from work due to illness - writes a consumer protection association - a nation of 'busy sloths' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct civil servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree. "
Taro will object in particular to the exclusion of sickness benefits, which depend on the activity; the extension of the period in which the patient can be checked to what time the visits will be carried out and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, 2,500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
The values of Inail confirm that we have some 1,200 deaths in 2007 as a result of accidents at work.
These values indicate the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as much death as the murders.
In order to restore the attention of the institutions, social and information means on this dramatic issue, Anmil is now celebrating the 58th National Day of Accidents of Work set for the second Sunday of October in all Italian regions.
"Concerned data extended by Anmilo and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of the issue of job safety," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for Mutilated and Disabled Persons for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his lively admiration for the constant joint efforts to protect workers, to protect injured workers, to assist the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion. "
'Naturally, an outraged 'enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of the tragedies, which, by their scale, cause commotion in the media and public opinion, but the everyday reality again offers dramatic cases, even recurring in their dynamics'.
Napolitano does not hide that 'there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education are of particular importance, so that young people facing the world of work gain clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed "how the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social situation, how he offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make convincing efforts to end this situation."
"With regard to the data of accidents at work, it seems that they show a positive turn, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from accidents at work is equally alarming," said President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We wouldn't exactly want this" reduction effort "to lead to less attention, because just as the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that too little is being done in general to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - the Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training workers, from the school age. "
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public participation.
But what is needed is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers against the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon. "
In the end, Mercandelli declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the levels of the right to compensation foreseen for the labour victims and the "suspension of support care" to which the system has reached in recent years. "
"The aim is therefore to return the guarantee of insurance to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or donation from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 players accused, putting their hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music devices as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a notice published today by the European Commission, which, in an official report extended in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Commission on Science on Health Risks that have recently arisen and have been identified (Czrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion - we read in the notes - it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music with portable musical instruments for at least five years, more than an hour a week and maintain a high volume machine, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that so many young people who use often portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," Meglen Kuneva admits.
"From scientific findings - the leader continues - there is a clear risk and a rapid response is needed.
The most important thing is that we must encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them fully effective and to keep up with the new technology '.
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Commission to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded by Executive Officer Eu - confirm the need to worry and now the European Commission will examine together with the other members and parties who raised the problem, what measures could possibly be implemented and thus better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, the source of which is portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is already a European safety standard that limits the level of noise of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage, which may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to reduce this damage greatly by looking for solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of the Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceed the limits currently in force corresponding to the maximum permissible noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission run its course for the future of the capital
We start today, we close in March, we have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidoglius to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital City of Rome," which met this morning in its new headquarters behind the Caracall spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the committee will compile manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present in June a strategic plan for Rome with the official stamp of Campidoglio and his councilman Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and it includes all the political, social and cultural ideas - it wants to highlight Alemanno - it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political arbitrators that remain the Giunta e Municipal Council.
It's not about changing functions, it's just about trying to have a place to process a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and will then be dissolved, because this institution must have a precise deadline.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, given that its views will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Commission's proposals to Attali, and I am sure that they will be in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics breaks down on everyday problems and the urgency that occurs from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to emphasise that "this Commission is neither a useless business nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, neither the euro will cost Roman citizens, nor will it serve to reflect and involve the best intelligence the capital has."
For Alemann, essentially, "you need to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definite nor immobile, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level it urgently needs, and think of the united spirit of its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome states, will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further "not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital city, but" will also include the role that Rome can and must play as a capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama? The first anti-American president.
One famous US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy with his decisions and maintained relations (both as a private citizen today) with the enemy of Islam. "
The attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama, however, has the audacity: he thinks he can get to the highest post of a nation that has had all two governors and five black senators! "
In fact, these attacks do not say much "; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and they do not answer the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then we have surveys; they all say that Obama will win, and with great momentum.
Even in this case, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the bowels of the South of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in an election booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
One page of the American mentality will come out, which remained wobbly until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll eventually take care of it ourselves, check who, Obama or McCain. "
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, almost certainly the success of a black candidate.
But despite all these democratic considerations, George Bush is the main weapon.
Did 1500 people ask: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers died, and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became a weakness for most of Bush's.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to do a huge job.
The US's economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: there is an investigation period in the paper, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
PEW Research Center has asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the people asked openly did not say that they had less concern about credibility.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to.
The problem is money for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a failed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where editors work to put together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades an American journalist.
Six out of ten press and executive seniors believe that journalism is taking the wrong path on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Bigger publishers take the road to the Internet, which many see as "killer" press.
The "economic pressure" highlighted by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred respondents admitted that they were resorting to technology in the hope of "doing something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms - that is, leaders - and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value falls to 23%.
This has something to do with "job security."
Leaders who think they will lose their job within three years are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're at 30%.
With regard to "certain work" concerning staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still on a daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists are working on a contract.
In such a huge nation as Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and internet employers often offer what they want, so the question is to take it or leave it.
Leaders get almost always huge salaries and the editor can earn even $10,000 a month except to pay pensions and insurance.
As far as holidays are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confessions, often get sick within a year.
It is only a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUSTICE IN ROOM, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTTAFERRAT
The president of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the submission of a businessman with the real estate of Daniel Coppola, who has asked to move from his town, Grottaferraty, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer for the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During his own-cost trial, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that a real estate entrepreneur may change his place of residence from a rural town to a capital city.
However, according to the court, this transfer (against which he expressed pm) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon occurred a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the $700 billion rescue plan submitted by the White House: a large proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is tearing apart the Republican Party, constantly more divided between its old soul, East Coast, milder, friendly to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to "those from Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the countries in the middle and the south.
A soul that was arrogant by the vote I was talking about in the beginning.
However, this issue is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not just in the United States, but in the West, and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, which are tightening up in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these is the reupdate, the extraordinary revival of the market, the double category of State-power in relation to a certain renationalisation of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis for banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, are largely included.
At the same time, this created a political problem for those who drive it: that means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost entirely national.
Political internationalism seems to be out of the question, or it has nothing to add: the clear proof is given by the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and different national strategies, and which cannot decide on a single common political line.
And so everyone expects the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the division of funds: when we get in distress, only states have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources, in order to be able to try and make things right.
It also has the necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have such an extent.
Indeed, this new emphase, which the crisis puts on the state-national element, is in complete harmony with the increasing importance of trying to attribute the latest economic advances to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Ironically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of situ, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance had already been destined to rule the world, all of a sudden we realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little non-material things as water, grain, diesel.
All things, who would have said, can be moved from one place on the ground to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the bounded space, territory.
So, who becomes their ruler, certainly has a lot more cards in his sleeve than who isn't, and who has the bad luck of living in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it predicts a break.
Who talks about territory, state, government, inevitably talks about politics, that is, leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, it appears that two convergence phenomena are being created.
On the one hand, the realization that authoritarian leadership is objectively needed, a request for someone who could seize the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit to existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in some sense, disturbing: discreditworthiness, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence, which tries to take over the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems to spread more and more in the broad massage of the people's beliefs than their actions are the same as the ideas of the popular elite so far, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word that the elite has already exceeded its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from underground, but a strong movement to eliminate ruling classes and traditional political order manifests itself in sudden electoral "unions" or unexpected changes in collective moods at the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of Labour in the UK, to the revolt of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, have more and more problems to understand, or represent, which, not today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is building up again, growing, potentially too cloudy.
Before that, it would be exaggerated to talk about a permanent "mass uprising."
But we certainly can't say that it means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity by super glue and walking on walls like Spiderman in the future.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM - American journal Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is the development of materials that already exist that use a particular carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
"The glue base can be seen as a series of tubes laid as an arranged pile of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the feet of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure a perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles, while "simply sticking off the wall" explains Liming Dai, the researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a provisional glue" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers think of much less fascinating uses as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
No super heroes yet.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkley, California, is also engaged in research on new glue.
In one article of the American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced glue formed from micro fibers like hair, which themselves are cleaned from dust by moving around the surface to maintain perfect adherence.
Medications: Never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their ingestion changes the intensification or reduction of efficacy with serious health consequences.
So that David Bailey, Professor of Western Ontario University in London, emphasizes the risks of juices both ready and fresh in combination with the ingestion of certain drugs, on the currently underway 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, raises a new alarm: one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects and expose patients to risk.
Grepo juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing up to toxic levels the effects of certain antiaritmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
IN RISK - The Italian medical agency itself announced this in the newsletters two years ago and encouraged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to be careful what they drink if they take drugs, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that suppress medicines.
A long list of effects subdued by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmaceuticals agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions on medicines.
So always read the illustrative list of medicines you get, and if you encounter something unclear, do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification "stressed the expert for Ansa.
Nobel for the Economics of Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novoquian who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political actions.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, on the days when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in one comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be much more important than the first, in terms of the consequences of the history of the United States.
A prediction that has caused little controversy and has been blamed for him for years, but it has proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked by the speed of collapse like Enron and Worldcom disappeared out of public interest, said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "an economist of great importance," but also a popularizer who has a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush Liberalist administration."
Open Office, we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production, which aims to penetrate to more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to a more famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of voluntary workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with various innovations: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window, additional, much more important ones will be added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
The focus is also on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, the Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Special features of some models are interesting as what allows to reduce PowerPoint presentation dimensions, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer PDF folder to the graphic design model and maintain the original image of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrid" documents that are similar to the typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a spreadsheet processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in excell it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program one color is assigned to each collaborator to comment in order to make a clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and they should present a definitive result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download 300.html, has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd can also be sent home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the issue of free-of-charge can be a draw for expansion in households, it is the business area of Open Office that the package is betting a lot, and it can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that is directed to replacing Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the release of a new version it is possible that this expected number can also be surpassed.
Also, Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, third-rated and top-top top t-shirt winner.
The message was quoted by the pages of L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive driver on Ceres, Epo third generation, after Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, he also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of Kohla fall within those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra.
If the control analyses confirm the positivity on Ceres, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the set two years of disqualification.
The report on the positivity of Kohl on the Epo third generation is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government of the outcome.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the stage of the winners behind Spaniard Carlos Sastro and American Cadel Evans, he also obtained a polka-dot top of the best climber.
IMIGRANTI: NEW YORK TIMES IS THE ITALY OF RASSISTO?
Italy, "as a country of emigrants, only in the last house, has transformed into a priority target for immigrants' adopted with resistance.
Is it turning a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So it asks in a long article of the New York Times, which dedicated this article to debate the subject of racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times define as a "paradox of the North": the northern regions are also those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigration thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League."
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by the Lega, which seeks to hinder immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism."
Students offering expensive rent - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the union for tenants, rent a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"It has already reached such dimensions that the entire class of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure - explains the head of the office for the Sunia studios, Laura Mariani - in this city, the large demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has fueled the process of rising prices, which has also spread to residents."
In most cases, rent offers contain several offences: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited lease, associated subrents.
For Sunja, an exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices through the tax review.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it is needed for a single bed of about 450 euros, for a single room is paid from the minimum price 650 (Bande Nere zone) to the mean value 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera zone) to the maximum 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed stands on average 350 / 400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the university, 250 / 280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, the Bologna Piazza), they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single bed) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single room of the Prenestine, Centocelle zones and so on.
In Naples, 300 / 450 euros per bed, 400 to 600 euros per room, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250 / 350 euros per bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have greater impact on the citizens' economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rent for students from outside the European Union, there is finally one other anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students compared to Italian students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities are disrupting the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favour of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is blind, like a face without eyes."
The picture offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documentates what happens in large Italian city centres, but also in rural towns.
The process of reducing cinemas, the birth of large multiples in the suburbs, and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central areas of cities, is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of genuine cultural crime.
It's like we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a bit of distance and emotion, "the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Oscar Tornator 20 years ago and a grand jury prize in Cannes, and he told poetry about a village cinema and sadness about a way of life that probably lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years the door has closed 316 cinemas of traditional tip, and the highest account has paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torina, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna, with a loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41), is at the top of the list.
And it is these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multiples: 195 more plates in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian process has evolved unrationally" says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the lack of funding to the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous government debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year to support the sector. "
What's interesting is the Bolognese case, the first Italian city to worry about closures, and which has decided to find a way to sign the protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax relief for operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to drive into a limited-traffic zone and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
"I like this initiative" says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures."
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a topic that was always important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bageria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a spark that convinced me to start the "New Cinema Paradiso," which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I go through the already closed Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I shared so many emotions that I didn't have to look at the writing blackened with dust, I turn to the other side. "
The connection between politics and the Mafia group 'ndrangheta, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to modify the city's election according to the interests of the Piromalli mob group."
The charges against the Mafia in Calabria against the mayor and vice-mayor Gioi Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarno Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, a namesake of a boss already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"Ignoring all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay for the consultation of the lawyer Piromalli.
"This would allow the Mafia group - written by judges - to officially enter the city's offices and facilitate the already huge possibilities of public administration control and governance."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal underworld are a lot in his region:" There are areas in which the concentration of the Mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndranghets, heroes who are still immaculate'.
The prisoners of this morning follow the imprisonment of July of last year, by which police showed that the Piromalli mob group was finally hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro had been dissolved since 1991, the reason was the expected link between organised crime and local administration at that time - local politicians were deprived of their functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of dissolution was elected head of the coalition of the right center after a closer election in May.
He was screaming about a scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He called to account for the former Deputy Minister of the Interior of Marco Minniti and accused him of plotting everything for political reasons, but the judges in the incarceration order signed this morning explained that the Mafia group had even reached such a point that it had requested a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations directed at Dal Torrion, written to the public prosecutor, revealed "the willingness to move the rights of a businessman, a representative of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the Mafia group."
When energy comes from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the vision of colossus like Chevron is now trying to stretch his hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years, and in the 1970s, research intensified in connection with the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil went down around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away, but now environmental organisations and a new rise in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that approximately 15% of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
This quantity would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centers.
Plus, there's currents and tides and tides.
The Giants are attacking.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional.
"Chevron studies the technology of ocean energy - he has spoken to a spokesperson for a company that is connected to the United States oil colossus, in the Wall Street Journal's economic daily newspaper - and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a marine energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially given that it is in Alaska that oil continues to mine, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drill.
In addition to Chevron, they follow the trail of marine energy as well as Verdant Power Inc. New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show an increasing interest by observers.
The technology that needs to be developed by the bush.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in the early days because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
So far, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to be causing major ecosystem problems.
However, technologies with a greater impact on the dilution need to be used for more energy production.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are connected to each other.
The force of waves that move up and down buoys is changed using cylinders and Cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine that supplies power to the generator.
The energy is coming to shore with underwater cables.
For the time being, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase, which are only waiting for federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping centre and the parking lot using six sea turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides and tides is caused by the rotation of the turbines, which are fed by this rotating motion by the generator.
Verdant said they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
The waves, the tides, the tides.
At this point, particular interest deserves the potential of tides and tides, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although it is an incoherent factor, the tides and tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
Indeed, countries such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7 1 / 2 million in the energy of the tide in 2008 and have predicted investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
