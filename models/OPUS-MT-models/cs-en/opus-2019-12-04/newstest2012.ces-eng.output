Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the proposal to abolish the paragraph on the basis of which the opposition leader, Julija Tymoshenko, was condemned as part of the amendment to the Criminal Code.
The adjustment that would open the way for the prisoner ex-prime minister to be freed was rejected by Members at the second reading of the motion to reduce the penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly inconvenient contract with Russia to purchase natural gas.
The sentence is not final, the appeal of the condemned is to be dealt with by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the sentence as a political vendetta of the regime, a suspicion of the bias of the court incited a trial in the West as well.
The motion that Section 365, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, should fall out of the penal code, supported 147 Members in the vote.
It took 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation or the Libyan rebellion that the losers have.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists win the election, but the question is whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied for Sharia's customary law, and we already have an idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country because a hand is cut for stealing.
Women can forget emancipation, potential renegades from faith await execution and so on.
Instead of being a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is not the only one, nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans mentioned.
In fact, it is a wonder that Islamic warriors have taken good help from unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that, from their point of view, NATO was not driven by an American general, but by Allah, whose size they celebrated in every successful intervention.
So, if there are winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in a firefight, served Islam, and our politicians in the dictator's person got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy Libya militarily.
Thus, the problem with the banishment of "crusaders" goes to the locals.
But without the occupation of the oil company, will they have Libyan black gold for a kiss?
They may not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of the selfless protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, the Sharia law worshippers can stop us.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe have hit the investors' spotlight.
The statistical storm went over Europe on Tuesday.
The individual countries have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated interquartile, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is breaking records today.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP rose by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany, in addition to better than expected (growth by 0.3% instead of original 0.1%), stated that it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original figures spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
On a quarterly basis, however, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and thus confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance growth according to the CSU.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy increased by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated steadily.
The German economy increased by 0.5% in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonal figures.
Both the euro area and the European Union's economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2% year on year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
The proceeds of Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical boundaries.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The proceeds for Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
Germany has voted that the ECB should be the lender of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro, and they're celebrating the 200 million dollar advance.
Football team has done the hardest challenge of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Petr Jiráček won 1-0.
Czech football, even with a large portion of luck in the second half, has defended a luxury lead from home retaliation and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the progress game in detailed reporting.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
Czech representation, thanks to the home loss in the finish, the great Czech and hero Jiráček won happily 1: 0 in Montenegro and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
The Black Horns did not get into pressure until the second half because of the precise defence of the Czech whole.
The losers of the match became Damjanovich and Vodabic, who burned two great chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Czech Republic, the Czech team will not be missed at the European Championship next year, and the prize of about 200 million crowns will also come to the national football register.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hardly involved in the combination and played mostly around the halving line.
The pressure of the domestic footballers also did not come in the first half, because the long kicks for defense were precisely averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed at noon on Tuesday before the building and then cried the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a living shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
They thus show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that Iran did not seem to stop seeking nuclear weapons.
There is talk of a possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then cried death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack designed to cripple Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, the target would, according to the Israeli press, be the Natanz facility in which uranium is enriched, apart from the ISfahan Centre.
Obese child's menu: doesn't eat breakfast and eats sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9% of schoolchildren being overweight and 5% obese.
The obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey has shown.
It once again shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which he grows up and the patterns he is surrounded by.
For example, sausages appear on tables in obese children up to half as often as in families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had for dinner the day before the research related to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence of more than 19 percent obese.
In fat families, it is also not customary to sport, but this concerns most of the families of today's schoolchildren - only 15% of children have responded that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
Research among 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year and was attended by nearly 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of Obesita's event, not a coincidence, supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Up to now, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from the 4th to 8th classes have been involved in the project.
Good eating and sufficient family exercise is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obesity children.
"Only half of the enquires, for example, stated that she has five times a day in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner mode, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition," one of the results of the survey is.
No breakfast and no evening sausage
Experts point out that relative details are important for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of school children eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding out that you don't eat breakfast at all in ten households.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 per cent of the children questioned regularly, the result was less than half - 15 per cent for their parents.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own diet according to their own tastes and opinions.
"The eating preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
"In particular, the great popularity of sweet sodas is alarming," is stated in the final survey report.
For lunch as a main dish, pasta won just above the poultry.
Children, however, practically did not want pulses at all, and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetable dishes is also low.
Addendum to health
At the same time, research has shown that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In many cases, there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition for a group of survey participants who filled out a questionnaire after the end of the Obesita awareness lecture," stated in the results of the project.
For example, it was very distinctive with sweet sodas, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children also checked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire much more often and would limit sweet meals and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, a true pro.
In the editorial article on how stylists learn, I kind of complained that there was a lot going on in the opening hours.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Lectures of three professionals in the field, dressing up troublesome characters and a seminar on how things work on the set.
And it gets worse.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we have ahead of us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "beat."
This time, Director Alice and I discussed (there is not a single boy on the course) how to dress a woman who is not perfectly symmetrical.
And the vast majority of them are.
Some have a short neck, some have a boy figure without proper curves, and some have overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, extend his neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We have also received tips, both in the female type Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist, to emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not to dress the woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers really don't fit, then it is worth getting at least one such piece tailored.
You won't regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a custom-made skirt, you'll feel much better than in one that keeps moving, rolling, leaving in your waist and so on.
The male figure can, in turn, afford to wear clothes with mascara, apps, embroidery or recruiting.
Of course, there's a lot of information and character types, so I'm glad I have all week to sort out all the information in my head.
And yet, I'm afraid, given the homework you've given me, it's enough.
Because each of the girls got an assigned celebrity to come up with two outfits: day and night.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the individual and the type of character.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, you may know her from Victoria's Secret.
In the spirit of dearth, for me personally certainly better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained perhaps a hundred kilos (please consider the exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the Internet and print them and then process them graphically.
Moboboard, as the whole result is called, will then express our personal style and relationship to graphic rendering.
Thinking about the graphic aspect of styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific items such as handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of characters, was set up by three guests in the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skillful stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want originally trench coat) can be worn classically over jeans and T-shirt as a coat, but you can dress it up on a bare body, dress the shoes and take pictures as a dress.
Or you just roll up your sleeves or collar and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he pointed out.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly to work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jakub.
So I finally get why we're crushing down all these lessons that we can combine with, for what, why, when we sometimes see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have a lot more clothes prepared than he can take pictures of.
So at the fashion story, which will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set" at least fifteen.
And it also looks and works in combination with other pieces of clothing quite differently than it actually does.
That is what we must count on when creating the outfit.
Honza Pokorný has confirmed that the image and style are always up to half the success.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylist services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it's enough that I can do something, the way I look is secondary).
And if someone is already getting styling from us, then we're supposed to assume that they're very likely to dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than they actually have.
Then all we have to do is Google and see if the tabloids have written about the celebrity's loss of weight and all that.
On Sunday, both Honza and Mario told us that it was not enough for a stylist to be in fashion and to be able to put together an outfit.
In his work he mainly communicates with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist as well.
To be able to tell people, not to submit, stand up for your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to sort out her wardrobe and complete it with nice pieces, you can't throw her whole closet out and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things to commend and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what all must contain the so-called "flask," or the bag on the set.
It's the one you turn around your waist and you have all the proprietas you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair roller or safety pins, there is also a power thread (with which the stylist helps to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips by which we fasten the back of the clothing if it is bigger (the pin or other clamp is not allowed, it would damage clothing) or sewing.
In order not to listen, but also to try something on, we learned how to stick to shoes properly.
Even in a photo shoot in an studio with a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch our shoes with scissors so they don't accidentally damage themselves.
So it takes real skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation unconditionally.
I mean, the particular skill is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation of the course.
It's becoming more and more clear to me that it's not really a walk in the park, no matter who says what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.
Reviews
Originally a carefree ride turns into a routine morning shift due to a series of completely useless sloppy mistakes.
The ambition has been largely achieved, but it is not valid if no one was clearly willing to do anything extra.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run woke up before issuing high expectations.
He promised that the years-old race series Need for Speed would move again a bit in a new direction and from playable pointers he appeared as a game that might not be just in numbers in the genre of action racing.
We were also wondering what would happen to the embedded passages in which the main hero would step out of the car and take place on his own.
But as the NFS series is a habit, many of them are a little different than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down several unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So it's actually not even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You're in a story whose lead hero Jack has certain personal issues and offers to participate in an illegal race across America as a solution.
You will take the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
The idea carries several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is driven on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't feel like you're offering the same thing for a second.
Some of the environments are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous works of the series.
So it's not a world-class thing.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snow mountains seems visually very pleasant.
Moreover, from time to time, the races are enhanced by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get tangled up in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be buried in an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well placed behind each other.
There are only a few types, but it's enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the desired number of opponents (basically a classic race), then make up time again (classic stop fight), and then there's a duel with a single opponent waiting for you.
The police will also get involved from time to time, which makes your efforts even more difficult.
The news is the passages outside the wagon.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it is surprising that these passages are much less in play than you would expect (perhaps even three).
In the end, however, this is to the benefit of the matter, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above mentioned, it is one of the elements that will enhance the game.
The model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is certainly not something these days, but it cannot be said to be a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more active racing of the local driving model still suits quite well, even though we could find a better one for the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
But problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the model of the road, the collision model is no longer in order.
We do not expect this type of game to calculate complex distortions and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave before any impact on any object, then everything is probably not quite right.
Typically, when passing or passing cars in normal traffic, you only lick each other slightly, but sometimes in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even just blow it up.
Thanks to the reboot system, it doesn't matter, but it's going to upset you reliably.
The restarts are dealt with so that if you smash yourself or drive far off the track, the game will throw you back at the last catch point on the track.
But only five restarts are available in each race.
If you wear them out, you have to start the race all over again.
So it's more of a tool in case something goes wrong than you could rely on them specifically.
But sometimes restarts don't help, they are solved by the need to learn the part of the race from memory.
The great ailment of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners need to be passed in a specific way, otherwise you just can't fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It will upset you especially in situations where you can see your opponent passing in front of you easily between two anti-driving cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get there, because it's "calculated" so that the situation always happens right under your nose.
The competition has another advantage.
During the whole game you will find several places where once again, regardless of the time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
It hits the most at the end of the long bridge game, where you're going in the opposite direction.
Apparently, an opponent has to get there in front of you at any price.
When he's driving in front of you, he's making your mind up about the anti-driving cars, so you're probably going to break up in there a couple of times at first.
You can understand the intention of making the game more exciting and adrenalin-like, but the execution is so obvious that it reliably quickly disgusts you.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes so action that sometimes you literally can't keep track of where things fly.
And it doesn't really matter whether it's a concept with 50 unique tracks, a race shift so that boredom doesn't stand a chance, or anything else.
The unconventional idea is to switch cars during races.
You have to keep an eye on the petrol pumps on the roads, because that's where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you can make do with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example on winding mountain paths.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and mode challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
Different items are unlocked to obtain a higher level of driver: starting with cars and ending with background for profile.
He is also reconnected with the online Autologg feature, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides other community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you can reach the subway tunnel (be it), where you take it in the dark on the tracks (be it).
The numbers are flashing between 150 and 200 km / h (be it) on the speedometer, and the subway set comes in from behind, and you are uncompromising.
In the editorial room, we will probably still have a few days to discuss whether nobody really thought a little bit about it or whether the authors think we're really such a big jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in several cases even great.
It is unfortunate that in some of the more tense moments, the imaging is falling rather tragically in some cases.
This is mainly about accidents with a larger number of participants, where continuous imaging would be of no use to you anyway.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category "every dog of another village" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, someone probably won't buy the game.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so highly self-conscious.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS work in the last few years.
But this is how the game looks unfinished.
I'm sure the fun is fine, but get ready for the mistakes to hit you in the eye with the power of airport lights.
The singing choirs of the UK will be heard at the concert by the students of velvet
The association of International Student Day celebrations and the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with the musical experience offers the third festival Festa Academica.
During it, he will introduce himself to 20 high school and college singers.
The main centre of gravity of the festival is two concerts held on November 17th.
"Charles University has a big stake in the festival."
"Among the participating choirs is the Choir of Pedagogical Faculty and Faculty of Humanities, Rector Václav Hampl will sit in the festival committee," said the head of the organizational team Jakub Čaloun.
The highlight of the entire festival is a free public concert of high-school choirs, which will take place on November 17 at 14 o'clock in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.

Detailed information can be found on the festival website www.festaacademica.cz
Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for negativity and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously undermined the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down a bit, calm down and for all players to get used to their new roles," began their lecture at the Faculty of Law by the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, Milena Vicen.
In the first part of the lecture, she has shown how much she takes her motto "In a clear and open way about Europe" in which she has been able to describe the various EU institutions and their relationships in such a clear and understandable way that many speakers from the UK Law Faculty might envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was a criticism that he was bland, that he was a grey official, that he couldn't perform any role, and I must say that everyone was breathless, that he was very good at that role."
"He is a man who can listen to and communicate with the 27 Member States and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in response to the question: 'Who is the European Union? Which telephone number should I call?', that is, as an important step towards unifying and greater readability of Union policy towards countries such as China and India.
No one wants to stop us from having a baby.
Vicen has also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency referred to it as a success.
The Czechs dealt with the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis, or organised a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was then marked as a major negative which damaged the Czech Republic very badly.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador, "really busy" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being resolved today.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union still needs to be approved, which is making it very difficult because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and cost-effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less, is all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: 'Europe in a clear way'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, lingo that no one understands.
How is a citizen supposed to understand that there are really no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that we really need to be banned from the raw fish. "
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe ahead of us.
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than positive aspects of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when the Polack and the Hungarian come to me and the Slovaks are coming, the Frenchman next to me says," Hey, what are you doing there, what's with the Visegrad Four? "and he doesn't look happy about it."
In the future, the Union, according to Vicar, is mainly facing new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
It sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe as very real rather than a new 'European federation'.
"We have countries of the euro area and countries outside the euro area."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, only the countries that they want and those that they don't want are told to cooperate."
"There will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for the word that would most accurately express the IBM strategy, "long-term" would probably be the closest.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, a company seen as very present, and yet a hundred years have passed since its inception.
The basis of this longevity was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He's already set the password that a number of world problems can easily be solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will depend (and also the name of the internal magazine that started to come out in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"To us from IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained loyal to its fundamental values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred, "said Samuel J. Palmisano's current CEO on the anniversary.
Processed system
In the 1930s, Watson treated his employees in the same way as Bata's businessman in the Czech Republic - the IBM people, as one of America's first employees, had paid holidays, insurance from employers plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and merchants.
The IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
Since the beginning, the company has been brilliant at extracting talent - as one of the world's first companies, it has abolished any discrimination, so it can choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, led by IBM, will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty next year.
She has been in IBM for 30 years, still in charge of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called yams in recent years, online brainstorming, which has resulted in many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there's enough ideas - nearly half a million people work at the firm.
Institutions with a good name
The firm's strong internal and external image provides a firm position in business.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technological firm," said the Economist Professor Harvard Business School and the author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology firm, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue," as her logo in the United States makes her familial, has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrared, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies, and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a disk.
This year, IBM, with roughly $220 billion, became the second largest market capitalization technology firm (Apple's first) when Microsoft was ahead of it for the first time since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations have hit customers' taste and time - IBM, for example, has failed to bet on its own OS / 2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, a rival Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM's sales are mostly part of the service, after about a fifth they are made up of software and hardware.
In 1990, he was the strongest hardware representative with more than half his share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth $15 billion, investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies during the same period.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the new financial crisis took place for the first time in the world.
IBM acts according to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis unaffected.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent rocket, net profits of the company continuously increasing.
The fire code of IBM is to change everything but its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
History of IBM: From Cheese Slice to Space
IBM (International Business Machinery) was established in New York a hundred years ago, originally having a complex name for Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken over only in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as the famous "fuck-ups," i.e. hours recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board of the company until 1930.
Flint hired the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - the invincible corporate culture and identity are still built on Watson's ideas.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began to produce and sell all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson was running the company, the turnover doubled to nine million dollars, and the company's massive expansion into all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost 40 years in the chief's chair, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, replaced him.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System / 360 series.
The classic "cock" that established the computer standard of that time, called IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold Lenovo's computer production to the Chinese company, but bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to fully deal with consulting and high value added services.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years of IBM is the concept of the Smart Planet, the "smarter planets."
Its aim is the smart use of technology in the still unplanned areas, as well as the improvement of the situation in transport or urban governance, for example.
For trade, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country as well.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia back in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, apart from the IBM of the Czech Republic, there is also a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
A speedster about an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychták (53) became not only a protector of Iveta Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and come home.
But now she's not going to wait and set clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa may return home, but no longer as my partner," explained Speedster.
When Darina Rychtářová granted the asylum of Bartoš in her home in the summer, she probably didn't even dream about how her marriage would end.
Despite Iveta's insistence after 30 days of the Roman move away, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, made peace with her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
The angler doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Speedster and Bartosh had ever broken up, his wife's open arms wouldn't be waiting for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live out his life in our house together, no one will banish him."
"But he will live to see it not as my beloved, misguided old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," said Speedtářová, saying that she had already left her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing his back door.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and I will not change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I have a normal conversation, except we don't share beds," said Lightning Speedster.
If Speedy had found a new love, she wouldn't have stopped her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility, "said Joseph.
The worst women's habits: do they concern you?
When you ask men if they can name some typical female habits, they're usually all very quick to spill out of their sleeves.
Dear women, will you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female habits that can perfectly pump blood into men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being a shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like buying and buying at discount?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should control their shopping passion at least a little bit.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around in the clothing stores, looking for well-fitting tops and then trying them all out (ideally in different colors) in the stall?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a complete hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you in front of the front door...
Constant discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with the way they look.
Not that you should stop worrying about yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to how their partners complain about their looks all the time.
The stronger the sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaining, the more annoying women are.
Order and purity in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping tiles, dusting dust, scrubbing tubs - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on a dirty foot on a clean pavement, children, for soiling the scrubbed sink and covering the glass living room that you've done so much work polishing?
If you are suffering from this particular "perversion," try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated, and order and purity should certainly not come first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness may compromise your relationship and family well-being.
Spurring
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
"Are you gonna wear those old socks tomorrow too?"
"Wet towel doesn't belong on the floor."
If you poke your partner like that several times a day, know that you can dial him up reliably.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to poke them that hard...
Slander, gossip.
For some women there are also rumors, rumors, but also insults and associations against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to talk to each other about who, where, who, how, and why.
Perhaps each of us will have some harmless little gossip or gossip every now and then.
A hand to the heart, it's owned by all women.
The opposite, however, is the gossip of the rudest grains, which like and often gossip, perhaps despise everyone and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the female working group - in particular.
Jagr and Voracek helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey attacker Jaromir Jagr participated in the Monday NHL game with two assists to win Philadelphia 5: 3 on Carolina ice and is again leading the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux benefited from the overview of a 39-year-old star, which added one more pass and was declared the best player in the game.
Jagr's teammate Jakub Voráček recorded two assists in the match.
After the game, Jagr said to the overseas journalists that he predicted Giroux a big evening.
"Before the game, I told him he'd give a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," Jagr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the first Flyers shot.
Shortly later, the team's second hit was Czech.
Voráček won the round behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it among the rings scoring Maxim Talbot.
The second one before the first break was reduced by the weakening of the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Giroux, in particular.
After working with Jagro, he scored his third goal, then remelted his shot into the fourth goal of Wayne Simmons.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jagr appreciated his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning around," added Jagr.
Carolina still made drama out of the game, the goal of Tuom Ruutu and, again, Dwyer, who got out of the penalty shot, got away with one goal.
But another complication was not allowed by Matt Read, who ended up outnumbered two-to-one.
"He did a great job in our Pronger band."
"He poked out the disc, I picked up the speed and (Read) drove to the remote pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last goal of the match from his point of view Voráček.
Philadelphia has won the Eastern Conference.
Czech defenseman of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game against Buffalo, in the second period he resigned due to an injury in the upper body.
Candiens lost their two-goal lead next to the experienced bek and lost after the penalty shot 2: 3.
One of their raids wasn't transformed by Tomas Plekanec.
The home coach rather than the lost points was sorry for the massive sick of the back row, with only five defensemen playing the game.
"It's bad."
"We only played the match with one experienced player, the rest were young men."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The rotation after the rotation was coming down on us, and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moved the puck out of our band."
In this we had gaps, "added one of the defensemen P. K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty hits of Winnipeg to a 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
Five different shooters shared the Jets goals that interrupted the five-game losing streak.
How prices of tours have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
At that time, travel agencies only sold tours to socialist bloc countries in the vast majority, as Western travel was very limited.
Thus, Czech tourists travelled to the sea (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility of travelling to Yugoslavia was also possible, but then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the age of socialism was that citizens of the Socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovak people) were not allowed to travel individually within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise an individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered tours to the West at the time, but it was necessary to wait overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" in the travel agency.
But it wasn't even won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people," who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so it was not possible to raise funds (Western currency) to travel to the West without a foreign exchange promise.
However, by far the Czechs most often spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, resulting in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs had purchased and this habit still survives today.
The travel of Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While holidays in GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum by 1989, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible to travel freely to the most popular Croatia for us until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the visa requirement for neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, starting a huge wave of short-stay visits mainly to Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough of the trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for a while.
In Paris, for example, tours of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, because our income at the time did not allow us to pay for the hotel or the guest house.
The typical feature of Czech travel at this time was driving your own food, cans, salami, etc., to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists to buy free Western currency after many thousands of years.
However, our standard of living and, with this, our average salaries increased, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Due to increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours regularly since 1997 with charter flights, making air tours incredibly cheaper compared to the past, thanks to the possibility to negotiate quantity discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had already had visa-free travel to virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when due to considerable demand it was sent from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exotic, it was to Thailand.
From this year on, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs per year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists, and by doing so, our country has definitely been among the world's most advanced countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and spent more than CZK 15 thousand per person for the first time in history for one foreign holiday including the cost of the place of residence.
The General Meeting is to find the Chairman, but again there is a danger of a stalemate.
Almost five months is Czech football without a chairman and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburka.
There is still no agreement under which the electoral order is to be followed.
Without it, there will not even be a vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hasek resigned his post in June and, on leaving, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hašek, football slid back to the cliffs between the two union chambers that can't agree on a common candidate.
It turned out completely on September 16th, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov unnecessarily because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a choice.
There was no agreement as to who was actually entitled to vote at the meeting - whether only statutory representatives, or even full-power officials.
At this single point since then, there has been a partial agreement, which was also helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the Law, according to which representation on the basis of power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
The executive committee has not put too much clarity into the situation, which in its negotiations, whether proper or extraordinary, does not, in fact, solve anything else.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round in order to rule out the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," stated one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FACR Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, one of the candidates will win, who will have greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running.
Morava is said to be willing to make a concession to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the advantage in this percentage addition.
"But it would then cease to make sense of the two previous rounds, which would completely deny the two-chamber concept," understands the objections of the Moravian Party of Freedom, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the statutes of the designated electoral order are the most suitable of all candidates for Pelt.
"I wish it was voted according to the statute, at the most."
"In order not to invent any deputy nonsense like at the previous general meeting," said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and who, in his statements, was mainly against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new President will be known in Nymburka and he believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All passions will be calmed down by the possible progress of the national team today at the European Championship."
"Soccer will be on a happy streak, more willing to cooperate," means the apple tree, who has the greatest experience of managing football at both professional and regional levels in the whole three.
Tomato is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately, the situation is very divided."
"It is not between people from the Czech Republic and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations to their purpose."
"This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," said Rajchl.
There's not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete at all by the time of the game.
The air special in which the Vice-Presidents of Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, namely from Prague due to technical failure, did not leave this morning and was looking for a replacement option to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrage retaliation.
Finally, perhaps a decisive meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, will take place.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobš would like to force divided parties within the country's strongest sports association to agree.
There is a lot to play: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is fighting for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have met all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have even applied for the top position.
"If a high-quality candidate exists, I'm fighting for him, and I'm not going until the election."
"But in the current situation, no such person could be found," said ČTK Paclík.
In a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl, Paclík is driven by motivation to try to stop Pelt, the alleged favorite of the elections, from leading the FACR.
Paclík also points out that, in the event of his victory, he would only last as chairman until 2013, when there is a proper general meeting on the agenda.
In his position, he would like to see an experienced and top-level manager who is not too connected to football.
"I've spoken to some people who would be eligible."
"It was crazy for me when some said that at this point they didn't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that look," he said.
Paclík is said to be most concerned about Pelt's connection to the Chairman of the Plzeň Regional Football Association, Roman Berber, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known backstage as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclik to be in Pelt's chair.
"If he had won, the current state would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbro, who is a skilled businessman, football would not benefit even more," said Paclík.
It also suggests that Pelt's name was reported in wiretaps years ago in an investigation into a corruption affair, but Pelta came out of it unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige would bring to Pelt's football victory."
"And what we would also look like in UEFA and FIFA's eyes," said Paclík, who, however, is already taking his former statement, that he would "sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta became president."
But if Paclík triumphed in Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, ended in a fiasco, is also considering it.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the head of representation."
"But he couldn't manage the association in managerial terms."
"I don't stick my nose where I can't, either," said Paclík, who, in September, raised great attention by standing behind the appeal of the referee committee led by Ludek Mašall, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says he'd dare to lead the association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also led Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the premier league triumph in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to its particular cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which goes into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan head of Daniel Kratín.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relations of the FACR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political leaders for getting more money from the lottery tax into sport.
"It's one of the key things a new president should be doing."
"If there is a gambling tax, as declared by political parties, I understand their argument, but they have to say straight where the money will go," he remarked.
As a liability, Paclík does not even accept his connection to the Pilsen Club, although he himself claims that the Chairman of the FACR should be "supranational."
Pelta is connected to Jablonc again, Rajchl with the Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point in hypocrisy transferring my shares to someone at the Pilsen Club and returning there in a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new FACR statutes to rule out the electoral trap
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelt promised that if elected, he would be set up to have new statutes for the FACR to definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the election fight will significantly dampen the potential success of the football team today.
Pelta already promised, before the September unrealized election, that it was the representation and fundraising that he intended to concentrate on the election.
Until the election before the last general meeting, he decided to go at the last minute, so he could use a two-month delay to defend and present his ideas of football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it is high time for the association to be led by someone," means a man who is primarily associated with the Apple Club, but who has served for many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That is why he believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that behind the current election problems is the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek's reign.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Meeting, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we did not allow different interpretations, we had a chairman since September," Pelt pointed out.
It was just the recasting of the most important document of the civil society that it saw as a decoy to delegates.
"If I become president, I'll take it as a personal task and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if I fail."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He says he keeps trying not to define himself against his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Henry Rajchle, whom he recognised for his legal education, and he knew well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He hadn't even attacked Thomas Paclík in a long time, who, on the other hand, didn't let Pelt get away with it.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's had some success."
"But his attacks were undignified, and a lot of people were surprised by the campaign."
"That is why many of them now doubt his true character," said Pelt, who is said to remain faithful to the proclaims he announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, according to him, is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to representation.
That should be the showcase of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemian causation or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"After that, I would have gone into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure enough money for the entire football game," said the ČTK 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival at the forefront of football would not mean any personnel cleans.
"I would first have to become familiar with the filling of individual employees," he said to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from the long government.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the general meeting, they believe that the delegates will not go to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
"If the only point of contention is how it's going to be voted in the third round, then we can move on."
"Football needs credibility, and the only way it will get it is by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before perhaps the decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FACR would start working hard under it
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Thursday general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
For Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will work hard.
It wants to push for systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work that the previous President Ivan Hašek began.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," said Rajchl in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player, and I want to divide competence in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a particular area."
"And I will be giving out hard tasks to make football a mile forward in each of these segments."
"Many people would probably not be happy because they would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people throwing sticks at me constantly and questioning my every move," he explained why he hesitated.
"But many people told me not to give up, because then others would give up."
"That's trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He's supposed to be motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hasek.
"A lot of work has been done over the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away."
"There are processes that are not going to start again for a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, with concern, that if another candidate named Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation on the union might return to before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelt knows how to do."
"Above all, there are people behind him who would do football in such a way that it would only be for the chosen."
"I can blame myself for a lot of things, but I certainly can't blame anyone for taking sides."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," remarked Rajchl.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech President.
"Even though some people are trying to say otherwise, I intend to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider splitting the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"There would be no current situation where only three Moravian units are in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," said Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík joined the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice-President and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers his success to be saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the contrary, he is complicit in the fact that the union does not pull together.
While he claims about Pelt that he is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football," he considers the other of Paclik's opponents to be a strong candidate who has something to offer for football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he had been elected, he might have continued to do the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not have changed the staffing of the committees in any way."
"He would not want to twist it in his favor," the rivals Rajchl evaluates.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from the point of view of Uphon, a luxury swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a tour of cities or travel let his tired feet rest in a thermal spa.
The book will show where the wellness is most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder was released for the past one and a half years on discovery trips, her luggage should not have been missing: her bathing suit.
Lying on the water, she looked up to the height of the artistically shaped dome, she swam across from the marble putti (characters of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)), waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she put it in her notebook in a flash - even with remarkable details of the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the historian of the architecture Meder and are now presented in his published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing)": People's Floaters in Munich, the historic palaces of swimming pools in Schwarzwald, "The Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led it on the road to the most extraordinary spa in Central Europe: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for swimming culture.
With sports, it doesn't go too far, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
The only thing to be angry about is that fans of swimming have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine smell, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why swimming pools must be so ugly," says the living Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Scrub in the diving pool and ethereal oil for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real eye pasture: "Instead of the floor, a person has water levels in the spa."
"It is transparent, on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically duplicated: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (Bathing Joy)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis of wellnes - but above all it makes you want to jump into blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by the collector of Mrs Meder's swimming pool in her search for Hungary.
In addition to the magnificent healing spa, like the 100-year-old Széchenyi Spa in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the cave spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as thermal baths whose pools are filled with alkaline water and located in a building shaped by a bottle (Város Termalfürdö in Jaszberéna).
On the other hand, many heated swimming pools in the open air in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful spectacle. While a person has from Zurich roof swimming pool in the eyes of the whole city, the outdoor pool of the spa in St. Anton can watch the snow covered by Arlberg - and: In the steam spa there is a window from which to watch the activity on ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Out of three open pans in the winter, steam rises while the Ötztal mountains move towards the sky in the background.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not every pool collector in the pool, Mrs. Meder, the smell of chlorine went up into the nostrils.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the bath of Arpad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells of heating oil to the extent that you can hardly believe that you have reached the healing spa.
The odour comes from a medicinal water containing alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather strange experience of wellness.
However, one place was also Iris Meder in her search for a nice spa disappointed: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902 the architect Dusan Jurkovic designed the spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the decaying windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds growing massively between the tiles.
They faced the demise in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already had three stages of construction; one can discover not only the new Romanesque elements, which came from the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa resort of an expert at the Iris Meder pools, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's been quite a feat, connecting so diverse building styles to such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At a palace like this, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal issue.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank has the commodity trade checked
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann instructed the task force to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, it is clear: 84% of Germans, according to one study, find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
In fact, two thirds of the people questioned demand that Deutsche Bank and the other credit institutions step out of this business because it deepens the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of the Forso poll under the responsibility of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices up high, and therefore the banks are complicit in the world's hunger problem.
The Consumer Protection Campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank's boss Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk business have withdrawn from supply and demand - and have made profits on behalf of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: he promised to examine the complaints and said that no trade "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Working Group controls complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's Board of Directors - together with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
Then, at the end of January, the bank's representatives want to tell us what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in trade in commodities or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices is particularly drastically showing how unscrupulous the bank is today harming the general welfare."
Let Ackermann, as the highest-ranking bank lobbyist, fulfil his duties.
"Deutsche Bank must cross off all items for which money is used for betting on food prices' said Bode.
"Lhojno, whether Mr Ackermann is concerned about hunger suffering people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Group Chief would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
By averting disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - he should eventually deal with his successor.
Any other investment in raw materials would give rise to
Foodwatch is trying to keep high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Institute Forsa questioned 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
According to this, it considers it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with which food price bets are attached.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they were to know that their bank is involved in such transactions: each other would have given notice of all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials as a result of the poll.
43 percent would warn a friend of a bank like that, 49 percent would say that he would think about giving up his account and move on to another institution.
The house of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy end: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won the prize, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and desolate.
It is now opened again as an exhibition house.
When it boasts for modern postwar architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold explosions and new building materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is an excellent and famous example for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958.
At that time, the Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and exalted construction of steel and glass.
The construction is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He celebrated the architect by building a pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder palace plus as a key performed by secondary construction in Munich, 1973 became internationally famous.
As a temporary exhibition building, the designed pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Railway Station), reconstructed and opened the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - it was named "House of the 20th Century."
But the building was not suitable for the museum, either in space or technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Yet it was used until the present art had reached a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been decaying more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now bearing the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery, has been promoted.
Husslein-Arco, a renowned art historian with a distinguished career, i.e. a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, promoted strongly reconstruction with politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same-name foundation, there should be a cafe and bookstore, and an office building must be built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
Krischantz was the ideal cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer's Technical University in Vienna and the Pavilion was a "very important place" for him, at which he "almost every weekend" saw exhibitions.
He knew the original project and he also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness in its relocation to Vienna and the change of use.
In the current reconstruction there were much bigger problems: the building was a "catapult for energy," says Krischantz.
Glass façade window profiles have been replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were saved.
The two underground floors provide a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still an upstanding Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door is preserved, the building is painted in an old stainless red-brown colour tone.
And the cinema hall is even the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Monument Office and the low budget.
"Often a material that is good and cheap and also liked the Monument Office," says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," said Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-History."
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place," yet it wants to "awaken the right self-esteem."
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, as urban luck occurred: In the Schweizer Garten circuit, a completely newly designed "City District near the Main Station" with office and residential houses is created.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: the house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, already talks with the city about the neighborhood at the Schweizer Garten location.
The runway is planning a package for the winter crisis at a million-dollar rate.
The runway has patched up a crisis plan to prevent train failures during the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That's gonna cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn issued more than 70 million euros this year, according to the newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper brought a preliminary report referring to an internal group plan, saying that a total of around EUR 300 million was expected by 2015.
It is supposed to make better use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
The plan is to double the number of internal and external staff per 16 000 people to remove snow on railway installations and platforms.
The aim is to rid the platform of the start of operation and 90 percent for operation of the necessary switches during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Rüdiger Grube Railways warned of train blackouts and delays during this winter.
In the last winter, the passenger rail had considerable problems because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, it had a shortage of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, there is a delay in the handling of ICE trains.
For years, the runway has also not been able to handle the fact that ICE trains must be checked more frequently when one ICE train at Köln Central Station has been destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the USA
After the commotion around Josef Ackermann, there are new tramps in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, a giant caught up with his past in the US: the Frankfurt institution pays $145 million in one balancing procedure (EUR 106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's a mortgage sale.
The NCUA financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for leading cooperative banks to buy financial products with false promises; that risks have probably been reduced.
Such papers lost considerable value in the course of the crisis and pushed banks into the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," said Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admits no guilt by offsetting it.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The president of the NCUA, Debbie Matz, welcomed the kindness of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and helps in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the billions of damages suffered.
Now completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clung to other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The dubious mortgage certificates are so called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They're based on bank loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became fatal for a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place a few years ago, the banks are now blowing a sharp wind at the outskirts.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous actions to remedy or to affect errors.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 international wholesalers that two state-owned American real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have put around $200 billion at a disadvantage in mortgage business.
Deutsche Bank, too, has to face the FHFA suit, with more deals totalling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "material losses' without, however, giving any precise amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requests as unfounded and claimed that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett entering with 10 billion to IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT business.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, a major US investor Warren Buffett has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term corporate development is difficult to predict.
However, he has now read IBM's business reports and changed his views on investment in the industry.
He had a long time ago to understand that IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the IT department of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is considered knighted.
As a result, it may be called the matte rock IT IBM now "Sir IBM."
For Buffett revealed at CNBC's US economic radio station that he had purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett sagte, that IBM didn't know anything about his involvement yet.
He praised management, which even sought proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres for a long time.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting and powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has been rather avoiding technology companies to date.
It claims that it only invests in companies whose activities it also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, lubricant manufacturers or machine products.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns in addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
In the 1960s, an 81-year-old master took over a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, and made it one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore an iconic figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM shares increased by one percent before the stock market started.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, and is considered to be the world's most valuable technology businesses, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, there's so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to get on.
The Founder Bill Gates is said to be his confidant friend.
Threatening is palpable
Following the discovery of the Zwickau cells, the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
The newspapers are even talking about the "bloody ideology," which is now coming back to life.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was responded to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For for many of the German Turks, this brings back a spook that has long been considered dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
There was no doubt about this in Germany.
But the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals an extent the dimension of which can no longer be seen.
"Is the blood ideology coming back to life?" were the headlines of the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
On the other hand, the "Sabah" newspapers point out that one of the perpetrators should have been a secret police agent of the Constitutional Protection Service and fear that also the German authorities might have been involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community responded with a serious response from Germany: It remembered on the weekend with a demonstration of silence at the Brandeburg Gate of victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, remembered the ceremonial act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as the history of success.
There are reports of several Turkish media: "A gift from Germany to the fifties" is the title of the article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which reports on the background of the murder series.
The publication of the "Hürriyet" sheet for Germany also does not allow it to make this connection of thought.
"It's starting to stink," the headline is Ahmet Külahci's column.
It points out that people who paid taxes were murdered and made an important contribution to the recovery of Germany.
The police procedure and its late success in the search are most critically discussed in the German and Turkish Internet forums.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically quick to use drastic means: 'If this activity continues to be so superficial, there will be nothing left for immigrants but self-defense and armed'.
"That would be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and proportionality of punishment for the entire network depends very strongly on internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen."
What it means if internal peace is threatened in Germany, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the burn site in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has shown the living Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence
But the attacks have made the Turks feel a more visible sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German policy after the assassinations was criticised at the time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a wishful telegram to the Turkish state president, but at the funeral ceremony in Köln, he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech then calculated what fees the Turks had passed on.
Pretty much as if the value of a man was measured by the height of his taxes.
The current news of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local state-law order is.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate the right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal Bank at Zurich Lake
Europe's most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis, and has been slipping from one crisis to another ever since.
Now some German is supposed to make it right.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that 2013 would take on almost the same speculative new job: the President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank of UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed himself publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound integrity and said friendly remarks towards future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached its turn."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was already clear in September that everything was going to be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London has bypassed all the bank's security systems and has wasted approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, a respected banker, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS board has also been on fire - and everyone is asking, "When is Axel Weber coming?"
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Board of Directors will take over in May - not just in 2013, as the Bank said on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough on Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emissary banker, and he would certainly need time to process.
In the near future, he will take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once again proved that he deserves the title "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
For UBS is both huge - until recently the world's largest asset manager - and has been slipping for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing seems to be spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had excellent reputation.
Image of a silent and solid, but also a cunning asset manager combines with ambitious goals: it also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So she managed UBS 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she advanced as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
The former banker and later longtime professor of banking in Zurich, Hans Geiger, says: "I used to refer to my students at the time to UBS as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one asks," How could I be so wrong? "
He was quite wrong.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the head of the board of directors, who has been considered to be a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he knew why he left.
The Bank's investment division wasted Subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
In order to keep it up, UBS has shown a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
Indeed, it has found investors, but one that would have recently turned its nose: the opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab state fund, which was so discreet that one could not even know its name.
But that was just the first hit.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS, owing to its failed investments in the financial crisis, faced a meltdown and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought out of UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to the mandatory convertible bonds for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of Switzerland's economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save UBS again," says the banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by a second disaster.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in a tax dispute with America and showed willingness to issue data to wealthy customers who, if possible, were cutting taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on unjustified profits from these transactions, including a fine premium.
This made UBS more or less openly aware that it was helping to cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in a rich client competition: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it was before.
It was followed by the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board of directors.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, over a few months, the bank has lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking due to poor speculation and asset management for tax cuts.
And just as it calmed down again, just when UBS was thought to have recovered, this unfortunate business anabasis came: the only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it is clear: with risk management in investment banking, it is probably still not working.
"In the case of Adoboli, it appears that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz finance professor at Zürich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it cannot handle risk control."
After all, it was precisely the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers made a long time ago to become keepers of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - the world collapsed again on this side, too, for the Alpine Republic.
Swiss banks' safes have become a symbol of unshakable reliability, such as Lindt and Springli for especially high quality chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the clichés of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The Bank has its main headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße, Zurich, which leads directly to the Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry shops like Tiffany's will be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Springli Confectioner.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
A heavy revolving door enters the reception hall of UBS.
Inside there are walls lined with marble, standing in front of them are massive leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large rudder to the "safe."
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.
However, this idea of a Swiss bank was sometimes repressed or betrayed by both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the paper, eventually closing business with both banks, like all Swiss bankers.
UBS has probably grown too much, it finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
I guess the Swiss have nothing more to say about that.
"And if they had, they would have adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which changed UBS, brought it high profits at first, and then disaster: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, a government coalition of a small seven-million-dollar country decided on the greatest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If they talk to Swiss bankers, they see you as a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks merged into a massive group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and was growing ever more.
In doing so, it helped that both different banking predecessors of UBS were complementary: one rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a centre of gravity in asset management and poorer but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came to a great deal of money, with which they could spin a big roulette wheel.
Two names are associated with this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future," says the banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, a man who drives his feelings around his stomach, who has come up from banking science."
But Ospel was supposed to rely on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "I guess he thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The obvious thing is, pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall meetings of executives in which the Group Chief Wuffli repeated the same motto again and again: Knock Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She listed "League Tables," a waiting list to document the success of the banks at that time.
In it, UBS tried to place it at the top.
She's done a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she took part in the game at the very top.
But the business advisors who have been entrusted stress one weakness: in international interest-rate trade, in the speech of "Fixed Inside" bankers, there seems to be a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has loopholes in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS committed itself to an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
The hunger for growth has invested both the bank itself and the fund established by it to secure risks in US investment Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that changed securities into US mortgage loans and passed on - but it also kept the risks.
Also when other banks were looking for a way out.
"Back in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says the banking expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, how deep a fall.
One manager after another had to leave when trying to clean up was more difficult than thought.
The positions at UBS have become a catapult seat, and until today, they're swinging.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
They need to find a strategy for a bank that's gone missing from all the nearby business models.
The banking expert Geiger already has an idea: an end to investment banking, a concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to fall apart, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has asserted itself: It is to run UBS's long-term business, which was communicated by the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats will be crossed out.
That's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But to date, all he says is publicly that he and his mistress will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe is burdensome by the US stock market.
The impending recession in Europe has deprived US investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome has not achieved the intended impact.
The subdued production of industry on the Continent has suffocated hope of stabilizing the debt crisis.

In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye to a 1.2% drop at 5985 counters.
Industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and has prepared to end the boom.
In September, companies produced two percent less than the previous month, as communicated by Eurostat.
This tuned investors in the US sceptically. "We are not an island but an addict," said Steve Goldman from Goldman's management.
Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The legend of Warren Buffett's investment only confirmed this outlook: he said in one CNBC-interview that it might not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That is probably why it is too early, from his point of view, to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the old principle for decades and entered the American technological industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM boosted the stock exchange rate of the traditional group and let it first quote almost one percent higher against the trend during trading.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, field ravens are regarded as "troubled birds": however, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, the experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been in the city's image for centuries, yet in some municipalities the complaints of the population are building up to impurity and noise caused by animals.
Meanwhile, there is no means of preventing "problem birds" from being seen.
The ravens of the field may no longer be evicted from the cities, experts on the first symptom of crows in the East of Léer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory have consulted on possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
Nature's protectors also derived the city's problems from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: the use of chemistry in agriculture seems to be increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Chasing, growing construction and cutting down typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are, among other things, in Soest, in the north-west, among other things in the Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and Leer.
There, the 2005 disputed project of mass killing crows in the rural district caused negative headlines.
Critics have called catching animals into bird traps and killing sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal banishment, alarm, nothing brings," so much was discovered by the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said also the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies break down and divide into other places."
Sobbing is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the view of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
The combination of driving animals out of sensitive residential areas and luring them to settle in other places is conceivable.
On the other hand, a psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens promoted the information boards instead of chainsaws because of a completely different treatment of animals: "We can finally best survive the confidence of one face-to-face."
Mrs Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg Trail, on which they provide information boards on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been accepted by tourists in the meantime.
Also, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is every volume of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: the field ravens use not only tools to achieve a treat, but even make their tools as a tool.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested behavior on four field ravens, as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must cause the structure to collapse to reach the pier larva.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically erected cylinder, researchers placed a small vessel with a larvae pier.
With a beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
But the researchers put bits of wire in there.
From them she shaped all four animals with a hook, using it as a pipe to hunt the container by the holder.
Three of the four field ravens even managed to cut it.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks didn't work out for the Cup.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won their last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoffs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronald (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and made 0: 0 the fifth time in a row in the European Championship perfect after the result of the first game.
The Czechs were satisfied with the result 1: 0 (0: 0) in the rematch of the Play-offs with the outsider Montenegro Hora, when the first game was already a clear thing.
The goal was not even given by Croatia with 0: 0 against Turkey, Ireland reached the released 1: 1 (1: 0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored another goal for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Federal League of Zvjezdan Missimovice, transformed by penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has failed already in playoff matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a custom-made start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters to the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his quality in long-range shooting and adjusted the hit from 25 meters to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not act in the first half hour, had their first clear chance at goaltender Edin Dzek.
The former Wolfsbur player from English at the head of the table of the standing Manchester City Club settled the ball on the lower edge of the plank, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
In the end, the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood in the center.
After the intervention against Helder Postig in Bosnian penal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36).
On the other hand, Stark made a questionable penalty kick after the Fabio Coentra event, which Misimovic had definitely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Master cleared everything up with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts in 81 minutes.
With this, the European champion leaves from 1976 for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
But the team of coach Michael Bilko with the legionnaire of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.
The goaltender Petr Czech prevented possible own goal of Thomas Sivok (9.) in the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo stevan jovetic and dejan damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the turn of the border of the criminal territory just around the goal of the Czech Republic.
After the break, the transverse harvest had to be saved instead of the already collided goaltender of the Czechs of the world class, again reduced the assailant FC Soul (50.).
The goal finally cleared things up shortly before the conclusion.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that point.
Four days after 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0: 0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is almost sure to relax his place on the third bench during the 2002 World Cup, the Croats may enjoy their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before 31.000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fabulous start.
Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance only a pole, the assailant Kazim also could not hang the reflected ball in the goal.
But after this terrible second, Croatia has increasingly taken control.
The Croats also didn't get the goal after the break.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who released the Dortmund Ivan Perisice from 62nd minute, the legionaries of the Federal League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Einacht Frankfurt) were in action.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of 4-0 in the first game for a preliminary decision, in 32 minutes to lead.
Konstantin Vassiliev (57.) settled for guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but it had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last minute did Estonian defense prevent a possible goal leader.
But in the 32nd minute, it was pretty far away.
After a failed defense of goaltender Pavel Londak Ward was in place and pushed the ball across the line at 1-0.

SAP wants to double its staff in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, invests billions in China in the coming years, almost doubling the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about $2 billion (approximately €1.5 billion) will arrive, Dax announced on Tuesday.
"We will create other research and development facilities and employ relevant staff," announced Deputy Chief Bill McDermott at the Beijing Customer Fair.
The plant now has an increase of 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of world-class business software branches doubles from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are in the country experiencing a boom.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's strategy for 2015.

SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal, supported by extensive research, is to promote sustained growth in China."
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's emotionally powerful new book entitled Beauty and Grief: The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War begins with such a long list of performers that your head turns.
One piece of advice on how to behave in that moment: carefully rip this page out and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know all the people very well in Mr. Englund's novel story, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a beacon - at times when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it quite well, as "antihistorical work."
It contains several well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, but it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists, and debates on tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as it is a "book about what it was like." It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Grief" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives twinkle like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones join in the mix of fates, while others quench.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classical historical novels.
It edits the idea that World War I was only about the fearsome trenches on the Western front.
"Beauty and Grief" has also skillfully explored other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve the problems of falling bee nests, spending Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or facing the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning, it's a very moving reading.
War consumes people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina reeking of gunpowder.
When there's a gun fire in the distance and you're a woman who's home with her children, will you run or stay?
Who's coming, anyway?
Almost no one understands what's happening, not even why the whole war has been unleashed.
"The vacuum resulting from the lack of facts," Mr Englund noticed, "was filled with conjecture, supposition, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and Grief" follows stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound terrifying and engaging, but they are absolutely alive and believable thanks to the integration of tiny moments and details.
Many of them talk about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Replacements everywhere are replaced."
"Coffee substitute, aluminium imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to "meat made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with fake bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato husks, shoes with wooden soles'.
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes'.
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner impulses to savagery and brutality in himself, and then he says about the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarian hiding behind the starched self inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will soon die with the greatest probability, and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When you finally accept that you sacrifice yourself, you would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict he will secretly hang."
Other comments refer to the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"Conflict was becoming more and more economic competition and competition," says Mr. Englund, "the war between factories."
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a custom-made dress who carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People act completely unexpectedly, malice alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some STD from prostitutes in order to avoid duty at the front.
"The grotesque example of this behavior was the trafficking in gonococcal pus that soldiers were buying and rubbing down on their genitals in the hope of ending up in a hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate of them have put it in their eyes, which has often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish language by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose is rapid, but not spectacular, which suits his human subject perfectly.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which war "unleashed completely unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on the First World War mostly, rather than with complex storytelling, worked with hints, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "At the Western Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming endings that he does not have in popular learning literature.
But I won't tell you.
But you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page out of your list of heroes and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute planned raid
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because by that time the Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except for a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the action, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
The cases of recent weeks, for example, when pepper spray was used against demonstrators, were not allowed to be repeated, thereby breaking the rules of separation and, moreover, the public's sympathy wave spread over to the squatters' side.
Therefore, the police operation aimed at cleaning up the Zuccotti park from the demonstrators was only launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
A massive exercise in the event of crisis situations took place in the Randall Island section, which was the preparation for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have intensified the so-called riot control training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on Lower Manhattan city.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "last minute" by someone who was originally explained as "exercise."
"I know a few police officers who were also called into this event, and they certainly weren't told that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on the condition that he remained anonymous.
"Only the highest-ranking department members knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, city officials were planning to clean up the park, but then they withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, they rolled up hundreds of them before the operation started.
Tuesday's event was attended by officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with a higher level of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people are coming into the park during the day, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do so when as few people were in the park," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up at the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplitude.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the ampllion scared many protesters.
When the law enforcement members entered the park in their blue windmills, many protesters packed up their things and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1: 45 in the morning, giving the protesters time to pack their bags.
Other police teams were spotted gathering at the edge of the park so they could break into it in case there were any arrests to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesperson for the police department, Paul J. Browne, claimed it was for their own safety.
Many journalists, however, take the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action and, moreover, some police officers have been rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street, along the west border of the park, could easily be filmed.
The police were moving in the western direction and intertwined with a dense mix of personal items protesting, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing. After them, teams from the health department went out to collect everything left in the park immediately.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documentation image materials appeared shortly after that on the Internet.
The most entrenched group of protesters had resorted to a kitchen near their campsite, which was located near the centre of the park.
Some set up a roadblock and the police started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the campsite tied each other to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called in to cut the locks.
Until 3: 30 in the morning, no arrests were made in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, and the police said something.
Mr. Browne said that some 142 people were detained in the park.
Most arrests were made because of "organization of riots and resisting arrest," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Detectives at the department, also participated in the operation personally.
Mr Kelly was present, but "was not involved in the management of the operation," said Mr Browne.
A second group of cops were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case there was a need to call her in.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were erected.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt further away from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they push people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5: 00 a.m., a demonstrator was spotted south of Pine Street jumping onto the hood of a police car, and several others were blowing air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The Union of Auxiliary Workers will sue the city for release.
Unions representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option left for the District Council trade unions in their attempt to reverse the discharge decision.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who were among the worst-paid employees of the city lost their jobs. Their release members described the city as retaliation for not allowing him to access the health care fund last spring, managed by the working parties, with the help of which the city wanted to seal a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the town council meeting last month, Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the board immediately checked that there was no specific talk of the release of auxiliary staff in the budget.
County Council 37 officials have announced that they have already completed the necessary documents and have warned the Ministry of Education that they will sue him. On Wednesday they will call a press conference to formally announce the lawsuit at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be a party to eight redundant workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, said that the city has not yet seen the lawsuit, and therefore will not comment on any individual charges.
According to the draft complaint that the New York Times managed to obtain, the unions focused on the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, thereby supporting their claims of unfair behaviour, because they consider that the poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while 17 school assistants lost their jobs in schools in Staten Island and in Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, and in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, 46 assistants were released.
It recalls that in Harlem, Public School 36, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, although it is a school where 68% of students live in poverty.
The Public School 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated bonus funds for every student enrolled.
The departments claim, among other things, that the directors of secondary schools may have been confused in the way in which the document authorising the release of parental coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's payroll to a database of available staff whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," he says in the complaint proposal, "and not just moved into the database at the position of available staff."
Mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something concerning the uprising in Libya.
But before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of United States troops stopped.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thank the American troops for their "bravery."
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who began to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may look innocent, but there has been no debate on Libya until now.
During the summer, legislators from both sides were constantly arguing with each other and the White House about the wording of a series of statements to approve or, on the contrary, to reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising limited use of the U.S. Armed Forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
By doing so, the US mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress criticised the way President Obama was running the mission, but it clearly did not deter its members from supporting it in its actions.
Congress's hesitation has finally surpassed other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August and killed Gaddafi on October 20th.
Nato's mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations in its statement 'congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable resilience they have spent in their efforts to free their people' and 'praises the men and women of the United States armed forces and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for exceptional bravery and professionalism'.
The statement also "confirms the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the Commission's full support for international relations receive a new proposal, or will legislators be split again in two, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party on the Commission.
On Monday, Lugar's spokesperson said that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will be voting this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (V.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other subject to be voted on by the whole House or the Senate.
For now, despite considerable efforts, other legislators have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals all the way to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution, which were presented in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal put forward by both the House and the Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget supplement and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending."
While some of the proposals are identical, their advocates - especially starting Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authorship."
The budget regulation decree approved in August required both the House and the Senate to vote on the balanced budget supplement.
In March 58, the Senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss restrictions on the number of periods in which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be President.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Il.) has offered a number of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
The amendment prohibiting same-sex couples' marriages and the amendment prohibiting the burning of a national flag remains a permanent proposal.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be annulled if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various amendments, they do not significantly deviate from the average compared to previous years.
In 111 Congress, they offered 77 amendments, whereas in 100 Congress, there were 66.
Their activity even fades compared to the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics of the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment, which was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated," says Gifford in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after the shooter injured her at a public meeting with the voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declared that she wanted to get better than to return to Congress.
Giffords showed up on "20 / 20" at ABC News with Diane Sawyer. She was seen to have trouble making sentences and needed help walking.
The whole show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to the wound caused by the bullet that penetrated her skull in the front, penetrated the left half of her brain and came out of the back of her head.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first TV interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special of the episode of "20 / 20," which was broadcast on the eve of the release of this couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope."
Special was tracking Gifford's entire recovery from the January 8th shooting.
The videos that Kelly made during the first weeks show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than lift one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair, and therapists are teaching her how to perform simple activities.
Head nodding.
Lip spatter.
And then, her first word was, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in the recovery of Giffords: The congresswoman sings along with the tune therapist "Girls Just Wanna Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who spent two hours a day in therapy, Sawyer revealed that she didn't remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said the Giffords read newspaper articles about the shooting on March 12th, when she first asked him who the six were who was killed in the incident.
The shooter is a suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missouri, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Terrible, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer was told that at one point, his wife, during recovery, said, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," described Kelly.
"You just got beat up.
But you can do it, you'll get back together, and you'll come back even stronger than ever. "
Military forces meet with compassion rather than respect.
The event was a gala on Wall Street that brought millions of dollars to war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines were running around him.
The ceremoniously dressed crowd rose and clapped enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who held the spring benefit.
In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was present at the ceremony, but he saw the role of military forces somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect, it was regret.
Such completely opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often distant, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is baffled with praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise costs something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for an individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and soon left Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This subject is very sensitive to military commanders who don't want to look ungrateful or mess up the public relations they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops coming back from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken in silence and privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from combat events where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be viewed by people outside the army from two angles.
From the perspective of some he will feel respect and amazement because they have defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But others will wonder if "an evil, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who was involved in the fighting in Iraq and took a seat in Washington's government upon his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him inadvertently indicated whether he could resist the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning with the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian lectured his sons.
The military's concern partly stems from America's indifference to war.
Success on the battlefield rarely gains recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own army and finds little self-benefit in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer respect military heroism as it used to be during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are decorated for the number of events they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to intervene hard against rape.
This week, it will be decided whether the trial of 28 women and men against the military will be initiated due to alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, they're prepared to file a lawsuit against hundreds of other plaintiffs.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old the night she was allegedly raped by her military colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a 12-beer box.
He asked her if she could join her, that they could have a little drink in her room.
"I have a warning light in my head," Lyman described.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they walked into her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact, which will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will determine whether the charges against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by the Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at that time. However, over the next few months, they increased to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army, and that the army failed to investigate, punish, and any pursuit of justice.
Burke claims he's after the highest ranking military commanders because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a direct system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent an effort to take action against such acts? High Command."
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of further actions brought in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - she has laid all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says - she will sue in several different cases if it is necessary to keep the pressure down.
The Defense Department's defense team is headed by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his associates, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents received by Newsweek discuss in detail the defense strategy - in principle, the fact that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under the order of the 1950 Supreme Court, known as Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," is written in the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this matter.
But things have changed since the '50s.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in combat, it is just word-making: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly significant role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed between these wars - two-thirds of them in combat.
The time has come for modernization in the army, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, and there are three other lawyers dealing with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies for the alleged development of an atmosphere promoting hatred for women.
Independent of this, a non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans is gathering evidence for his anti-military suit. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of a "personality disorder," which was allegedly found in rape victims, so that the army had an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati, a group of human rights fighters, Service Women's Action Network, this is a very common practice.
As early as December, its group filed a motion for action against a state organization for dealing with veterans, which it accuses of discriminatory practices that should have taken place in the processing of aid applications by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were tabled by a group of senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Ministry of Defence's Office for the Prevention and Management of Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13,5 percent of the estimated 19 000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In a report issued in March, the level of prosecution of suspects is also discussed: 20% of cases reported in the military - which is half of the civilian justice system - were brought to trial in 2010.
In the case of Deputy Burke, the plaintiffs describe the attacks only as the first in a series of traumas.
For example, Private First Class Lyman reported alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she says she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to 11 different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine rape, and her attacker's blood was found in her bed from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which she was asked questions about whether she had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were called to testify as witnesses to the alleged perpetrator who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the sentence was passed," says Lyman.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer," It wasn't his trial. "It was mine."
The Lymans ordered to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder, calling her unfit for duty.
She was discharged from the army in January 2010 without honour and therefore without any claim for service.
Whether the Lyman case and the other prosecutors move to the next stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, the law professor at George Washington Law University.
Of course, it says, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stage of the hearing."
However, between them and the verdict, the said doctrine has been criticised since the first time it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind, because their obligations do not allow them to follow the same level of incentive and deterrent.
He says, "Chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
The only way to change is if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided on their behalf, Burkeva, the plaintiff, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to file a lawsuit and start working on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists study you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July killing rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on a computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We have realised that it is not at all that difficult to get them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of the recently published report by the British Research Team, which concerned European digital populism.
The personal information supply on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says that scientists were enough to simply use the ad on the website to identify, with absolute precision, an idio-demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, and then they focused on them and sent out advertisements. However, instead of inviting them to a newly created group or offering them some dietary products, they called on them to fill out a questionnaire with questions about the level of their education, relation to violence and optimism in relation to their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from over 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not as surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are generally young men who are inciting an increasing level of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends, hidden by stock updates, wall posts, and pressed "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users, each providing three different data on average daily basis, making this social network literally "information supernova," which is behind the development of many new research.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"In the past, when you wanted to do a survey of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a side where they'd never let you go," says Bartlett.
"This all comes down to Facebook - you just go straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken editions on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moreno proposes that students' peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you cannot diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Centre for the Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise not have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly searches its users' data.
The information team developed statistics on the relationship between the relationship status and St. Valentine's Day, voting participation in 2010 and the national satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information to the site.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"In my opinion, most users did not even think that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they thought the information was only between them and their friends."
Subsequently, it is also a question of methodology to consider.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and on the wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two totally different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best tool that can be used in research.
"When you go to the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still happening off-line."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik is taking part in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among Norwegian Templar knights," he declared in court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you have been given a mandate by organisations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not plead guilty to them."
Judge Torkjel interrupted Nesheim Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could make his views known."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought his prepared speech, to address his victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, to ban any media contact for four weeks, and to announce that the authorities of authority will have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept under lock and key.
They all took part in order to move the case to an early closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," said NRK's commentator one of the survivors of the attack.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I went a little further mentally."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When coming and going into the building without any difficulty, looking at the journalists and surviving in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion of being part of a larger resistance movement, the judge admitted that he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
It may be a consolation to some that the attacks of June 22 appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it's not," said the relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, things would be so much easier."
7 lessons learned from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie headed to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, the views of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge, and they elected him to be his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
On a recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted for a special film headed to the movies this week, the fact will be for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and working flows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who matched every little detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs were suffering "from the idea that a really great idea was 90% of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent resulting product is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on a TV show called Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the shooting there was a unique, more than an hour-long interview.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company, NeXT, and he was eagerly looking at the broad public's acceptance of the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were reported lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
Just this material, slightly trimmed, forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which is headed to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has become famous for his reluctance to give longer interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly excited to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during an interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds to think about when you can see Jobs' answer perfectly thought out in order to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism is surfacing, where Cringely, he seems impatient and drives him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was made before Pixar, iPod or iPhone, and there are scary prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It's one thing to read Jobs' post-mortem reviews, but there's something raw and inspirational about Jobs, who we see here as a eager dreamer in the bloom of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things should look like.
It did not take long, and after he had expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How did he learn how to run a business:
"Over the years of business, I always asked," Why are you doing this? "and the answer was always the same," Well, that's just how you do it. "
No one knows why they do what they do, they never think about business stuff in depth.
That's what I found out.
The Commission therefore concludes that the contested tax ruling does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
He was completely confused about the way in which costs were recorded - often starting with the word "standard costs," he could only assume their amount. At that point, he decided to go his own way - developed an automatic tool to guarantee that they could determine the business costs within a moment.
How he did the rascals on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack into the phone company effectively and make free calls anywhere in the world.
There have been many written about the device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and let them switch from one AT & T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times, we got tangled around the world like this, so when we screamed something on a pay phone, it came up a minute later from the other phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found ourselves able to build a thing that is capable of managing billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
The two of us made a tiny thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would have ever been made without it.
Jobs continues to describe a joke that he and Wozniak almost made to the end. Through the blue box in the middle of the night they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, impersonating Henry Kissinger in their best behavior.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called up to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and only just before they woke the Pope himself to the phone, the couple laughed and put the earpiece down.
How he fell in love with technology (and on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12, looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett's phone book number and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company really is and how it's supposed to treat its employees. "
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher at HP, hung around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How they invent innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products while he's running.
In the early days of his career, when he set out to sell a couple of circuit boards, one customer asked him to put together an entire computer for him.
He only had 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he remembers the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having a pretty wild fight... yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that cost $300] until I got tired of it, I went out and found myself a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are running out of breath:
A long time ago, before leading Apple's resurrection, Jobs foretold with foresight that many industrial leaders would waver in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what else?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are in place, so the companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led society to its unshakeable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it is, it could have been Microsoft in the '90s...
But instead of winning, they made a loss.
How does he take innovation as an art form:
"Between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product, there is still a long journey and a lot of work... and as the great idea develops, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to make a whole series of compromises - certain things you just don't force electrons, glass, robots or factories to do.
You have to remember 5,000 things all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things mankind has ever created, and in some way you try to project them into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and, incidentally, also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the opponents of the Health Care Act at the time of their trial.
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would object to President Obama's health care bill, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a formal dinner sponsored by a law firm that would take part in the trial.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals put forward.
One of the cases under discussion was the lawsuit brought by 26 states questioning the radical recasting of healthcare that Congress passed last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges have agreed to hear the action, but in March, a 5.5-hour hearing is expected, with the result of which, in addition, will stir up the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who stands before the court and tries to get the law dismissed will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clemente's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society Group, which has been engaged for many years in defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Entrepreneurship.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court debate on the subject of the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Supreme Representative in the Senate, and a confirmed defender of the Health Care Act, took part in it.
Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: This pair of judges has been taking part in the events of the Federal Society for years.
And it's certainly nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to respect the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
If this had not been the case, however, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in actions which the relevant organisations and other organisations hold for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be listed on the agenda of the action."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas with two law firms in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was far enough to alert the activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and had dinner at the social benefit together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case in court."
Their presence and help in raising funds through this action undermines the feet of all claims of bias, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics and told them that they also have no problem combining their judicial duties with group actions such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, Conservatives argue that judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia, has a ethical problem.
Kagan worked as the Attorney General under President Obama's rule when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
The Kagan critics are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought for the law so much that she could now be unbiased.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she was going to resign.
Boeing received a record contract for jet aircraft worth USD 18 billion
The Emirates airlines order 50 two-aisle Boeing 777 jet planes with the possibility to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of their products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if the company is the manufacturer of the Boeing Co. aircraft and the price of these 50 aircraft together is a record $18 billion, it is something else.
The same important news is where Boeing obtained the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast issued on Monday by Chicago, the airline in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth USD 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history on the weekend as regards dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-aisle current Boeing 777.
The sensational order came from the Emirates airline based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines had the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would make the total value of the contract up to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger facilities.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole of Boeing," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
This means that not only do they have money to pay for aircraft, but an increase in the price of fuel - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself makes money at higher oil prices.
This is important because it is not as likely for them as for other airlines that they could cancel or delay aircraft orders due to the increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from the Emirates airlines strengthens Boeing's leading position on the wide-hull aircraft market and brings to a narrow company Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to undermine Boeing's dominance with its A350 traffic model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after representatives of Airbus announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER, will be postponed.
The redeployment took place because customers demanded a greater payload of the aircraft and range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the machine more power of the engine.
The price of Boeing Co's events increased by 1,5% to USD 67,94.
Apparently, Mexico's president's sister was defeated in the Michoacan election.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderon lost in a violent state election to become governor in Michoacan, and on Monday she later declared that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug dealers.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the governor's election of the Western State of Faust Vallejo by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of organised crime members in the entire electoral process, and especially until yesterday's elections themselves, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for the whole of our country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion group... confiscated ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and let people vote for PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
But he is planning an early return to power, and winning the election in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Calderon, who was leading the election the day before, very closely.
Calderon, the candidate for her brother's conservative side of the National Action Party, aka PAN, refused to acknowledge Vallejon as the winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who had been in control of the governor's office until now.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacan has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's native state, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
Violence, however, persisted.
The mayor of the PAN, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the election, and many candidates for the election resigned out of fear.
But whatever the outcome of the election in Michoacan looks like to the PRI party, victory will help the party to gain a new impetus.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallejo and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging in the coming year."
The Bank of ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help rescue the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise an overall decline in the world economy could have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of Manila-based ADB, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help a rapid recovery of the currency block through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the Bric countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were all following Europe's difficulties "too unexcited" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and means, would help to eradicate the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
For several months, the European Monetary Association has been severely tested by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have increased dangerously and both Italy and Greece's governments have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could bring the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge to bring emerging leading economies together to help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of European Union Financial Assistance Fund bonds, institutions for European financial stability - would provide Asia's partners with more negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do its best to help the Eurozone," because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a dry flow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are faced with a difficult task and must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It is not an alternative, it is a simple fact, because how else could we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to do with helping European economies when forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the USA, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from USD 2 or less per day.
"One day they might find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would be difficult to explain," he remarked.
Lee Howell, CEO of the World Economic Forum, has similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatening 'a dangerous domino effect'.
The bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 / 2012 is now facing a "risk of decline" due to a European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must develop "plans for unpredictable spending" in order to protect them from the decline and significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon warning regarding possible defensive cuts
On Monday, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta put a big lid on Congress when he warned that the looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion budget cut over the next ten years, but it is now afraid of a further USD 600 billion reduction if Congress fails to conclude an expenditure agreement.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," wrote Panetta in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or ship. In addition, further modernisation efforts could be seriously damaged," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will almost certainly also have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts touch the combat units, announcing Panetta.
"Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," said Panetta.
"There will be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in negotiated contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The stocks of paid staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and a consequent breach of both legal and political support."
Both Senators wrote off Panetta ten days ago and asked him for details on the possible impact on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure at the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panette's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign under it."
"Planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It remains to be seen whether Panette's letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress's authorising budget and increase the votes calling for the Pentagon to be omitted from the list of cut-off areas.
Panetta has recently been more and more open in talks about possible cuts, even though he has moved himself to a high position at the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense indicated a brief picture of what his resort might expect - an army shell, but inside it will be missing the core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade with no ammo."
"He'll be like the Air Force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of a speech at the Pentagon.
"She'll be like a morale-free unit, unprepared and incapable of coping with a possible enemy."
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed..."
In an annex to the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant reduction of privileges and deployment opportunities worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects might be expected to be terminated, including those already tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35 project, the planned new bomber, the new generation of ballistic submarines, the new coastal battleship and the new ground combat vehicle to which the army and the Marine Corps wanted to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save USD 80 billion over the next ten years, but its advocates claim that it is a necessary further step in improving the army, which is needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognise a lie
A glimpse of recent headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with allegations that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim that the other is lying.
The administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught with the microphone running, telling US President Barrack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
A lie could destroy entire careers and break the stability of many countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately disproved by undeniable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using his campaign funds to try to hide his illegitimate affair.
And no one ever forgets the media circus that went around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It's crawling with stories of cheating in school and college.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many scams are we dealing with?
Studies show that on one day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let's assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
Determining lies, or "recognizing lies," is an essential skill that should be acquired by everyone, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that is similar to, say, the Sarada, when one says, "I have you." Recognizing deception is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected during the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of research is that most of the old lie myths have been refuted.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're stuttering, stuttering, blushing or twitching.
But don't take it from the fact that it's somehow difficult to spot and detect liars.
A trained lie identifier can detect the truth from a large building, tiny expressions in the face, the way in which questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from an extensive and emerging industry on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be of great help to you in today's complex world - especially if your duties include hiring, holding interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more lies "aimed at others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (but the lies they say are usually "outrageous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's normal behavior.
It's called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he'll have a later finding out what to compare to.
Notice the subject's posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone is patting their feet all the time, so that you don't wrongfully accuse them of lying just because they start patting their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But just think of it as a warning signal, not as proof of a lie.
People who are telling a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they're trying to remember their imaginary story, the toes of the shoes can turn to the door, lean towards the exit, significantly change the posture or show "relief after the conversation" - excessive cost relief and change of position when there is a difficult confession behind them.
Interview people often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see what relief will look like after it's over.
Feel the subject's language as well.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once misspoke and used the past tense when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which triggered a nationwide search for her body.
The deceptive individuals can also express themselves in a aloft manner: 'I had no sexual relationship with Mrs Lewinski' or repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are very slight.
Some people can use a lot of "mitigating language" when they answer the difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In such an answer, we will not know too many facts, and it is often another warning signal.
There is no spell to uncover any lie, but it is possible to acquire skills to spy out a lie.
With these skills, one will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a cheater in his personal and professional skills.
A controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delay of approval by the U.S. government has emerged.
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thereby turning the trade unions against each other, but calmed down the environmentalists - the company in charge of the pipeline construction announced that it was willing to redirect the project to get things moving again.
On Monday night, TransCanada announced that it would move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
The degree of TransCanada Alex Pourax claims that the company is convinced that eventually the construction of the pipeline will be approved, even if it leads to another route.
This notification came after the Foreign Office announced last week that it was delaying a decision on a federal permit for a project, from which it would not conduct studies on possible alternative routes that would not be able to interfere with the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala waterborne layer, the vast underground water supply plant.
"This is a real move forward," said Republican Deputy Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, a year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to play any part in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support.
1,700 miles long pipes will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Alberta to the refineries in Texas, 700 000 barrels of oil flow every day.
Six states will have to be crossed this way.
This project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by workers who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear in the pipeline work.
However, the legislators in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala waterborne layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but the source from the energy industry said that the Ministry General ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study and focused mainly on two issues.
One was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, was a conflict of interest in the programme.
Another is whether the company that was hired to carry out the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of throwing up on a toddler.
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan house and scared their daughter into vomiting.
"Lady Marmalade" startled the performance of "Lady Marmalade" by 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family claims in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk landed the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of their house in Riverside Boulevard and brought Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a while and put the baby down for a while.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said," Do you know what your daughter's doing? "I said," Yes, "and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle was irritating to a pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said," You shouldn't put your daughter at the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her," I don't care about your opinion. "
She got angry and started talking dirty - screaming loudly at the meanest words...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started splashing water at me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
"I said to that woman," Look what you did to my daughter. "
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her when her escort, who then dragged her into the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so much she puked, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting apologies from LaBelle, but they didn't get any answers.
LaBelle's lawyer and speaker are not responding to our calls to comment on the whole case.
The prosecution is demanding an unspecified compensation, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that the family is planning to dedicate all the money to a charity organization dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"Such behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a schoolteacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate failure has hampered the economy
During the first year of the reign of Maria López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability grew in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined, and the economy with them.
The year 2011 will be written into the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, which is called the government of change itself. This government has brought with it great expectations of economic progress, but due to the adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and even the main indicators of economic development have fallen.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the potential for growth of the state economy, led to a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first semester of this year. In agriculture, there has been a 31.16% drop, which has undermined the dynamics of other economic sectors as well.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded at 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78,03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found to be partially damaged.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased during the first three quarters. From January to March 55 053 of the population of the state of Sinaloa was unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4,53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and August average unemployment increased further and reached 6,19%, representing around 74 000 unemployed people.
Less liquidity
For unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy, according to Gerard López Cervantes, the Director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment related to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the reduction of resources due to legislation approved by Congress in the context of the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who are illegally possessing dollars to earn, invest or use it."
Stopping migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad to the United States has decreased, both because of difficult entry and because, even if these people get abroad, it is hard for them to get a job. Thus, people remain and demand work from our state and thus unemployment is growing," he said.
Unreliability
The labour market analysis in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the increasing unreliability that prevails in terms of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the people employed in the state work without paying benefits to the social security administration.
Other features of the labour market, such as low salaries, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are from all over the country, as stated by the registries of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Labour and Social Planning Secretariat.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5 352 pesetas until September, well below the national average, which ranges to 7 375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Together with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment over the last 10 years was recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment amounted to $630 697 between January and June, representing a decrease of $87.74% compared to $5 143 312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government of the State indicated investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year, which were mainly directed towards companies in the field of services.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government asked the state Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million peso. By November, no debt gains were recorded in any sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, Mario López Valdése's first year of government pointed out a lack of governing skills.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Transformation Industry Chamber, stated that in 2011, there was no reconciliation of the will of individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, missing harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
The slowness of the economy
Loredo López stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year had stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frost. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough so that it could restore dynamism, which would enable it to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year we found ourselves far below the expected forecasts," he said.
Re-definition of the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, President of the Labour Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we see that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan is needed to redefine the objectives and economic direction of the state, because it is important that all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has is mobilised," he said.
The work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
It stated that the current administration has shown progress with regard to the conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is a view of the work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work before us," he said.
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
The resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General has informed the Republic that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval.
According to AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican military forces on 7 June 2010 on an errand in Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in El Castillo district, called.
The dealer was driving a pickup truck with a black bag in his car, and a small backpack in the passenger seat.
For these reasons, the man secured remained at the disposal of the Judges of the second department and the management remains internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impact of Crimes.
It owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, the Rescue of Public Seats and 3x1 for migrants, are in danger of not being reached by the end or of being very late due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Urban Social Development has stated that, if the construction work has gone ahead so far, the government of the State is now in danger of not being able to provide the relevant supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million peso per three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until this time, only the Federation and the city have supplied the resources for the work, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They are supposed to provide almost 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. Even though we were supposed to get part of it in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started the projects and continue very successfully, but we lack money."
He stated that last year, for the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State failed to meet the relevant supplies and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million which the government did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to raise funds to cover what the state had not completed," he explained.
Despite the fact that there was a commitment by state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that an application had been sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, to speed up the procedure and to arrive at the appropriate percentages as soon as possible.
"They were to provide us with 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we have not yet received a peso."
The Court approves the "end of analogue broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "switch off of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. It stated that there were no necessary eight votes to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree stating the steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to comment on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid, were not attained.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero provides for the possibility of declaring a decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter which, according to the law, is reserved for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), thus violating the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein leading to the transition to digitisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a debate on a proposal which is also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the proposal's arguments in the sense that a federal executive could not structure measures through general standards to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and recall that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of a federal executive with a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in years. It relates to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It believes that delaying change would delay the benefits of digitisation, which requires a decision on public interest, because digitisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "also affects economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he pointed out, these questions "require the operation of the entire system in place, in line with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences entrusted by the Constitution to the government of the state."
He recalled that many countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and did so through their governments, even though they had high-level technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it is not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree, which, to some extent, interferes with the powers of Congress, to introduce compliance with the laws of the legislature into the administration.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is less than 27 percent.
The possibility of adding "voice after voice" appeared in this year's election in Michoacán, where, in line with the figures published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the Governor's election is less than 27%, and the 879 votes of the total 6074 constituencies have not yet been counted.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed its political constitution or its State Electoral Code or the Law on Electoral Justice. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal period for their entry into force was due to expire in this parliamentary term and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted their publication within the prescribed period in the Act of the Official Gazette, with some objections against them.
9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the voice of the head of state on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal," because it has no right to "nor approve them nor veto them."
On the question of the possibility of counting "voice after voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council, it would be possible for the local electoral authority to carry out both partial and overall census.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more electoral bales, will be possible under the following conditions: voting results do not agree; there is no record of the census and the calculation in the relevant box or is not available to the President; or if errors and obvious violations of election results have occurred.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; each time an explicit request from the party representative and / or the coalition proposed by the candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
The overall recalculation of the votes will also be possible if, after a proper census, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has finished second place, in which case the election packages for which partial census has been made will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirmed by the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a ceremonial ceremony and a memorial service.
According to the family, the Lieutenant Colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After he and the other persons who died in the accident received the highest honours, the Bacio Cortese family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. The family and closest friends participated in the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the Lieutenant Colonel's ashes arrived at a chapel located in Nazario Ortiz Garza, where also family and friends came.
At 5: 30 in the afternoon, there was a farewell at the Technology Institute in Saltillo, which was organized by his former classmates from the technological high school and members of the American football team, which Felipe Bacio was also a member of at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the Lieutenant Colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire Air School in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "barely arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, like when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapan to graduate from his uncle, which is why he believes he died in what he loved most in his life: flying a plane.
They gave him one last farewell.
With Felip Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we parted with all the honours he had come to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in study and sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the days after the helicopter that he was driving fell. On board was also the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of this state.
At 18: 05, the remains of Saltillen native Bacio Cortés (cremated) arrived to be handed over through the funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the direction of Major Jaime Martinez on the premises, where the family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on Cadereyta NL farm.
A few hours before the discovery, military officials introduced 11 people to the media who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by gunfire to various parts of the body and the head were found on the abandoned estate of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on a 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the beige-coffee-fence cabin had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One person was wearing a sports shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not wearing a shoe. Next to him, a man was also lying in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few metres away, another person's body was dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were lying face to face.
According to the location data, all three persons were likely killed in another location because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime the other and also a series of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects have been apprehended in Cadereyta.
The National Defence Secretary presented 11 persons, including teenagers, who were members of a criminal group, who operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and who are associated with abductions, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the published information on the first attempt in the Los Alveros colony on 11 November, 8 persons were detained and one person was released.
Three properties and a cell phone have been secured, confirmed to be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
Another raid took place on 12 November at 6 o'clock. Military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when they noticed a car without a license plate and in it two persons.
After stopping the car, they did a search and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 bullets.
Then, based on these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was apprehended on 13 November around the 14th hour. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country above the abyss of economic disaster.
Tomorrow, the appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that has kept this country above the economic disaster and put the entire eurozone at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said that he would present the President with the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating government in less than three days, much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has led to debt levels rising to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the hard package of austerity required by European leaders, and only in this way will it be possible to restore Italy's failed credibility.
In Monti, there is a great deal of pressure on him to hurry, and because of the instability of the markets, the interest on BTP's Italian bonds, with a 10-year maturity, exceeded the 7% threshold, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Employers' Organisation Confindustria, said to journalists after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes for success have increased considerably thanks to PDL support from Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," said Angelina Alfano, secretary of the Midright Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant, because until now, a number of its members have opposed a government with a technocratic majority that Monti has compiled.
Parliament's support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women organisations on Monday.
The round will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who made it possible to proceed very quickly in response to the crisis.
After a short fall from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, the interest on Italian bonds returned to a critical threshold, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would reap success.
To save Italy, whose public debt amounts to EUR 1.8 trillion, would be beyond the possibilities of the euro area's current financial reserves.
Monti said that his government should remain in power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the general forecasts that say that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has gotten into because of financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that mutual mistrust and dissent between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate political figures into government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Out of 22 Spanish football players, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 called players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15: 05 at the San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, the number one monthly rating of the FIFA, have a wide range of class A inter-selection games, Costa Rica has only the defenseman Michael Uman, who only played 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday during the game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish football players, who play in the Star Match and Powerful Clubs of the English First League, have maintained intense activity for over a year in league championships and home championships and high-level matches within European cups such as the Champions League.
We must also add to the previous experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches for the European and world championship.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited possibilities of foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within the FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representation are held by goaltender Iker Casillas, who reached former goaltender Andoni Zubizarret last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will continue today against Costa Rica and get a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 games on his hands.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA, along with other Spanish players, who hold 100 matches. Among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle assailant Schalke, Raúl González, was 102.
A hundred even approached Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
They follow Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and near Michael Uman move left wing Junior Díaz with 48 matches and goaltender Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 crossed the border of 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shot in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bass player Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity for them to play in Costa Rica represents a dream come true.
That's what the bass player and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate twenty years of existence and on Sunday 20th will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will appear at the National Stadium at 7: 30, along with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of an interview that you can find on La Nación's website.
For your Costa Rican supporters, it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which is coming true.
We are barely the second time in South and Central America, and so far the experience has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they love the group here, the fans experience these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most vicious supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long.
Some people have been talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have arisen over a few weeks.
We did some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that's how we got into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, we're looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf it, we like the jungle. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its surf-worthy waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a great show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there are no limits to what we can't do.
We will try to show the best possible show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce to our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them, and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
That makes the show more interesting for us, which is why I think it's more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of art.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given and we are moved that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the genre grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which all the great ones are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group is created in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and it's an honor to be part of a group from Seattle.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a long time longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, firstly, we are all lucky that we are still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you balance?
The way we grew up, it became increasingly easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave her, and you can't let yourself get carried away by being famous rock stars, and neither one of us has ever really cared about that.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at the beginning it was something spectacular.
We existed as a band for three years, and we never published an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most importantly, even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I hear a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The Las Robertas National Band will be in charge of starting the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the opening act?
Yes, production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter in person?
That's the question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's adding the first thing he can think of.
Who affects you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to attack Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about the bassist I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge even though he's not in fashion anymore?
I think we've all always felt a little detached from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I think of groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time, and if music is still valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly bleak character, and now it's more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting, because I have a feeling that there are a few songs in the new album that are light, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they may sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and you have some kind of trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or your boyfriend, these things start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dreary music.
Peru:
Fujimori has been hospitalized again for medical testing.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss suffered in the lower extremities, informed his attending physician.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), is suffering from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, for which he has been operated four times and is under the control of doctors at the moment.
Member Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television station that Fujimori will be taking tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where he should find out why he's hurting and why he's losing his strength in the lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and other diseases like severe erosive gastric disease, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs were added to these problems, by the doctor.
Fujimori has served his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his government.
Mujica visiting Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of an extensive visit full of meetings with political, business and representatives of the Uruguya community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries, "published the Uruguay Presidential Office on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, the Latin American country has concluded an agreement to exchange information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to specify fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "blacklist" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), on which are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has enhanced the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he has never yet appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month to all shops around the world has been created from the beginning to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how a stereoscopy without glasses is to work," said a press worker specialised in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of a video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier," because up to now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adapting existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson stated that in addition to the 3D image, the "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple," whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can start the "second round" at the levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and "do not succumb to optical delusions."
This new entrance of Super Maria in 3D also assumes with the return of the character to a portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays into note to those who watch the saga and repeat a successful formula from previous episodes. It consists in the fact that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous minted platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in surroundings, in disguises and among the enemies, Luigi will also appear "playful."
Colom approved the release of Portilla to the United States
On Tuesday, President Álvaro Colom announced that he had taken steps to release former President Alfonso Portilla, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process aimed at having Guatemala respond at the request of the northern country, which demands the release of Portilla, so that it can be judged.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he had taken note that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that, during his mandate, he "did not" interfere "with court decisions and allowed all the editions that came to his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious assault and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloma's move is a step in execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead the trial against the former President, who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued once its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights are respected.
Portillo was found innocent in the matter of embezzlement of $120 million at the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency, and this process was preceded by extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and brought the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6000 young people in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children with no education, so they wouldn't be on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of social support organisation Trinijove is very important: 6,000 young people who were at risk of social exclusion have been helped. For 25 years, the organization has helped them overcome difficult situations.
To this we must add a long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary was also used to present a balance as part of a solemn act that took place in the former production premises of Fabra i Coats and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was established in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, drug addiction or in situations where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organisations and institutions who have cooperated with the association in the past 25 years participated in the meeting in Sant Andreu last night.
A diverse political representation, at the time of the election, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Maso, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Adviser, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Councilman Ricard Goma took part in the ceremony.
The present social welfare and family advisor, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and Director General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also came to the Grand Chamber of Fabra and Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was created at a very difficult time and that today also offers a wide range of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to date "is a good basis."
The President referred to Trinijov as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and to encourage people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organisation and for the work it does," he said.
There was an eviction of an occupied house, where there were giant parties.
The intruders claimed 11 of the 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All of this suggests that the nightmare that the neighbors of number 51 on Balmes are experiencing is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon last night, which they were illegally living in, where they organized giant parties that woke up neighbors, leaving the building under court order without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
Occupants who took 11 out of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest of them inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind the garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that, while the building was occupied, sales dropped 80%.
The disco owner points out that the occupants of the building were giving her unfair competition because they were selling drinks for 3 euros, while the disco is worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to the actions of neighbors due to noise. However, the problems were not caused by visitors to discotheques, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house, and especially by those who participated in the parties held here, whose frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the area.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and forgave her rent for nine months.
The city police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the past few weeks about the situation.
The Chairman of the People's Party of PP at the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for "the building to be evicted immediately and ended with the problems of civil cohabitation suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area."
The Chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor was taken a summer ago, but in recent months, the occupants have reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and one of them has even been stolen.
In this respect, he added that 'impunity must be put to an end and that we should be consistent when it comes to actions against civil responsibility that have taken place in the building'.
Yesterday, the city police also cleared out a building in Nou Barris.
At 15: 30, the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four of them were immediately apprehended.
Park or mountains?
The architects have gathered on the occasion of a trial that carries more than controversy about royalties.
The municipal tender for 16 gates again opens up a debate about the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the greatest boom of the already extinct Corporate Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with Central Park, New York.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the upper border of Barcelona. Catalan metropolis is one of the few that are not oriented north - south - but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of Yogi Bear.
This was the position until September when City Hall announced a mega contest consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entry gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, records the idea of the park.
It's either this or someone's trying to put the gate in the field.
So there's only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organisational and reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all of Barcelona's architects.
It is already a subject as ominous as when two members of this old caste chosen to meet in the elevator shake hands.
And it was this act that triggered one of the rare events between what three Barcelona architects and university professors think.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has its merits.
According to Roldan, after the question of the Gulf Party began, "the" mountain side "must also be discussed, so Ildefons Cerd's speech on green apples was not followed to the end.
"We must base ourselves on the principle that Barcelona's most spacious park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex, "said the architect, for whom the name" gate to Collserola "carries a" lexicological trap ": we must not imagine them" as entrances to the park, but rather as delineation of zones where it can be applied. "
Modol, like Roldan and Bayon, with experience in the world of urbanism qualifies the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers."
The danger arising from the "uncertainty now posed by the public place project" after the experience of the 1980s, which had "its swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very delimitation of borders where it should be built.
"To define something means to take the next step," that is, in principle, to take a step further.
"The new urban and planning instruments should be remembered, because the current ones (referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more closely on the question, Modol believes that the bottom slope of Collserola can be "considered a park," but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there was already work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in a junkyard," although he welcomes the fact that the City Hall offers its grémie that it will intervene in the project from "the first moment."
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to get involved in the debate, but he "doubts" that it should be this technical profile, which will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill," he adds) that needs to be created: "Architects should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because there is no global vision of Collserol in the tender documents: "16 competitions have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This causes at least him to sign up for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may come across the concept and definition of the architect of the adjacent gate.
In his view, the City Hall should ensure that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should ensure the full length of the equipment zone, ensuring a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino has forgiven Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released.
After 72 days of imprisonment, legal agent Cadino Red has pardoned Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jomus Larrabál spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after a legal agent named Casino Red has pardoned him in front of the Second Criminal Court in that district, who has dealt with a case of extortion in which Mayor Monterrey's brother has been indicted.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jomus was to ask him to pay for his economic quota so that the City Hall in Monterrey would allow for illegal operation in a betting house.
After a public indictment by the State Prosecutor, she started prosecuting the brother of the Panic Mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of Public Ministry Agent Number Three for Property Crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, stationed in Barrio Antigua in the capital of the state.
He remained at this post for the next 49 days after the second arrest order was issued and an agent of the Public Ministry refuted the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with an amount of one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in a prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to stay in the city cells in San Nicolas de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of the investigation, sufficient evidence was gathered to prove Jonas' guilt, including, for example, the payment of 1.5 million peso to casino representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be made possible.
This Monday, the legal agent, Casina Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for a pardon for the mayor's brother of the region. On this basis, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal proceedings, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been rectified and which of the associates had decided to grant a pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197 / 2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. No complaint will be possible in the trial against him. Also, it is not possible to claim compensation or punishment.
After a trial with a legal agent around 3: 50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanez, has come to the San Nicolas de los Garza prison to report to Jonas that he has been granted official pardon and his case has been postponed to the archives.
He also announced that the judge issued an immediate order to release him.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of an accident involving the death of the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communication and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident investigation, in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons died, show that the helicopter hit the terrain with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft launch, the pilot stated that climate conditions allow flights.
"Parts that appear suggest that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings tangled in a tree branch 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull."
He also reported that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore met all requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, it stated that no parts were found on the ground following an investigation carried out in the area of impact.
"In the search it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 persons, meeting all requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary has assured that the most important thing at the moment is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the President's General Staff was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on a soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a normal overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome named six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aviation standards, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate launch conditions, according to which the aircraft moves towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds the crew searched for a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
The location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the helicopter from the radar are consistent; it is likely that there was no loss of control before the impact, nor was there any disruption in the trajectory of the flight.
Distraction of aircraft residues in restricted territory:
The information currently available allows us to assume that the impact has occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A sketch of the diffusion of the remains of the aircraft indicates that at the time of impact on land, the helicopter was solid.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident to suggest that there had been an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is levelled, the slope is between seven and 30 degrees.
Photographs show footage likely to break up along that route.
Information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After careful search in the vicinity of the accident, the remains of the helicopter have not been found in a territory that is more extensive than the area of laying, which reinforces the presumption that the impact occurred in a state where the helicopter was still whole.
The Mexican Health Insurance Institute has begun research on the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect an obesity gene in children and young people. Research called "obesity genetics in children and adolescents" will allow you to obtain results related to overweight.
In a report by the Head of the Research Medical Unit in the field of biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Health Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and students of post-graduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestan) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public may also be involved in the research, with or without authorisation. People can come to participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will be tested by adolescents every Saturday from 8 am.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (the Mexican State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Zahualcóyolt Sports Centre (the East of the Mexican State).
As soon as the data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independent Sports Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors to Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific dietary questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, girth) are made each Saturday, blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify genes that are involved in the formation of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects health care concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years only boys had an increase in obesity by 77% and girls by 47%. A dramatic increase also occurred in overweight cases' said the IMSS expert.
It stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic features, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in genes that are responsible for developing diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, obesity genetics are commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, which will determine whether they have any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-coloured wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm suggests that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
For now, the information is confidential, it is transmitted in writing to the parents and is explained by all measurements and changes in the lifestyle that have to be made in order to avoid illness by their children.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day and using means of transport instead of walking a short distance.
Overweight also causes a large calorie intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in the asphalt of UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty of UNAM, creates modified asphalt with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, independent of climate conditions and temperature
If paving was properly taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the metropolitan area of Valle de México, alerted Rafael Herrera Najer, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even it would be possible to completely remove them.
In his lecture, the Technological Causes of Potholes, which he made in the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership develops modified asphalt with polymers, creating a mixture of similar characteristics to asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najer believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is the grouping of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules of great molecular weight, which are called asphaltenes, and others with low molecular weight, which are called maltenes. Together, they provide asphalt with a typical viscosity elastic character.
The Viscoelastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it acts as a liquid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, added.
This means that the integrity of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, alerted by an expert in chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Chemical Faculty observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers there is a asphalt insert, made of small pebbles embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms a liner is covered with asphalt.
It is thus possible for the forces in the tile to decompose well when driving through cars or when creating pressure.
If it was modified asphalt, it would have decomposed even better, thought a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt insert, the last layer of the mantle, made up of fine stones, was placed with sand also embedded in the asphalt.
As this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must provide friction of the road.
As part of the paving will be exposed to heavy loads, the mantle must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken for the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to remember. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is damp, the water spreads in and it's hard to get out, it causes softening of all layers of tiles and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that during the creation of potholes, the film of the mantle will be first destroyed and then the asphalt liner will be damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one moment, but it is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in the formation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load on vehicles and it must be ensured that the load will not be exceeded. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent formation of potholes.
Rafael Herrera has pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries and allow for easy repair of potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus receives the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has not reached the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for finding herself on the stage of the winner, getting a silver crown and a sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multimiss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's finale in Cartagena, in which she won and scepter took over Miss Atlántico, the department received the 14th title of first multimiss. Melina thus joined the ranks of women from Valle del Cauca, who reached the reach of the winning crown, but eventually were announced by the first multimiss. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Isabel Romero (1983), Gincés Aljure (1987), Leila Giraldo (1987),
The question many ask.
The result is the defeat of the great favorite, who in all previous rounds has shown that she has the power to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain to become the Queen of Police and the prettiest face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by the Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which have subsequently taken away the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only the first vice-miss is the fact that it did not convince its answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?" put by Martín Murillo Gómez of Leamos's literary editorial.
On the question of the candidate, she replied:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of study-learning. The book that influenced me most in childhood was" Little Prince, "a very deep book.
I'm currently reading "Crime and Punishment." It's a book that is part of a world-wide literature that we should all know, and today I have a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author called "El ardor de la sangre."
This response did not like, on the one hand, because of the term 'culturalisation', and, on the other, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her had done to her.
After the ceremonial ceremony Melina declared that she was calm and pleased with the result: "The world is wise what is to happen, happens.
And you people, read if you can. A little prince is a beautiful book. "
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogott journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, the most celebrated from the beginning, and the one who received all the previous prizes (the Gastronomic challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the Queen, who then burned on the scene.
It was evident during the first presentation of the bathing suit on the Hilton beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she was shining on both, it was known that she lacked the strength and passion that the representatives of Magdalen and Atlático performed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Make Home" program at Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's first vice-press title confirms the fact that the candidate who gets the most titles during the competition does not end up leaving with the queen's crown. "
Moreover, in recent days, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude towards the media, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
For the record, two days before the election of the international jury member Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the Miss Colombia competition beauty alone is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates before entering the competition are involved in such projects."
It is also speculated that candidate Valle has lost points due to the lack of her background and fibrosis that was visible on her bottom. However, this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, correct nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orozco, who prepares the Queen, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on her bottom, which I think was not very noticeable, took away her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes the Valle native made a mistake by undergoing several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here she took her toll. "
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, there was a cruel prediction after the swimsuit show that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo gave Melina so that he did not have to give her the highest crown in the end.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina started the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be appointed as the National Competition itself.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the riveting success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of a Cali resident who identified Alfonso Can's corpse.
A fingerprint expert from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Can."
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, an expert on fingerprints from the CTI in Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: "Alfonse Can," by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week, Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada, worked in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked at Chocó Town Hall, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to a place where there were corpses that had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking the relevant courses he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of friction of the skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against Alfonsi Cano, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take a card with Guillermo León Saenz's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance.
He didn't have a beard, dressed like a peasant in a given area, with no glasses, much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Along with a gallon magnifying glass, ink and a transplant and light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with the card records.
The eye didn't disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, a man of Puerto Tejada origin was instructed to confirm to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed Commander General Farc.
Search for tracks
For the dactyloscope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in the investigation of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present fake papers or don't have papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall because at this point the thief was leaning on to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to be printed, but in this case we could get a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts, "he recalled.
Fingerprints may also confirm or refute suspicion in the case of murder.
They found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him a while back.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it is not 100% possible to confirm that he was actually a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of a crime.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the objects are "wiped with chemical or physical reactive substances."
When it appears, a transplant or tape is used to extract it.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that at present there are still many Colombians whose data are not recorded anywhere," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it turns out in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything that sparkles, it's not gold, not everything you touch, it's a clue.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Indignation" protesting in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were in the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them were waiting for an order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked representatives of New York on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square with a court order, where they were brought out in the morning, and then tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of manifestants were anxious to get to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order allowing the "outraged" return to camp. The second part of the movement responded to the exit by taking up the park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle in order to return to Zuccotti, both through assembly and peaceful manifestations," said one of the spokesmen of the "Let's take Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the reply to the "indignant" to the eviction of the camp, ordered by the mayor of New York itself, Michael Bloomberg, reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced removal of the place and allowing the manifestors to continue to set up here.
In addition, "indignation" took another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the rectory in Trinity Church.
They managed to take the job for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some manifestants. Bray did not know the exact number, but he said he saw that they had also placed handcuffs on some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the ground, and a delegation of religious representatives has also come to support them and also to try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed; a court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestants even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the members who were guarding the square, which triggered "some small clashes," Bray said, who condemned the fact that some officers were beating the manifestants.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or from applying "laws that were published after the acquisition began, or from prohibiting the manifestors from entering the park with shops or other places that they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg stated to the press that, in view of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of public space and the manifestors had pointed out that local laws did not allow them to return to their tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and to which it was acceded because the manifestants were "breaking the law."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it became "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases hurt others," because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared for the quality of their lives."
"The morning vacancy was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added the spokesman for the movement that accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
The representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" also stated that they plan to organise "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with the community and trade unions to commemorate the two months after which the protests last, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, it will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at Home Improvement, lifeguard at Baywatch, bunny at Playboy, wife of rocketing musician Tommy Lee, and now actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on the special Christmas show of Canadian television.
Today, CTV's private television station announced that Anderson, along with the singer Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will embody the Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV showed footage of a television program in which Anderson, also known as the Internet-based pornographic images, appears with his ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in the manger.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, has recently acted as a host on the tour of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheena.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Bublé appears on CTV's special Christmas broadcast, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York "the fox."
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is rising by 1.5% due to household consumption, ending the fall period that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have quantified material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, heals well.
After three quarters of the fall, the value of GDP between July and September became such that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - foresee the largest growth rate in comparison with the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines necessary for the recovery of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% from January to March. This is the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of Japan's economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to emerge from it, to strengthen it, or to restore infrastructure, and that is to use the lack to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up, owing in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1% thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when the yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a huge burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to the yen course in September.
While markets continue to besiegate the EU's peripheral countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukwa yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts inflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even reached below the average, which is at level 100. It has reached a level of 99.13 points.
Athens is spreading uncertainty again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment.
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that once again prevailed, Greece is getting more and more involved in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "consensus" of the new transitional Greek Government is given to Brussels's demands rather than the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100 days he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and repeated his request for a new election on 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the government.
The 24-programme package to support employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new anti-tax evasion measures will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message by Samaras does not clarify any doubt about his position: 'We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else'.
The Conservative President went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF; these organisations are to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but he also said that he will not support and sign any commitment to implement austerity.
Yesterday, the European Commission, already enraged by the impact caused by Papandre's referendum play, stressed that its demands were not insurmountable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Three will return "very soon" to Athens and discuss with the new government "what he needs to pay the sixth part" of 8 billion. However, the final date does not exist.
The Greek forewoman has a little more to meddle with.
Queen Sofia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen is highlighting Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance.
Spain "has achieved a significant global position in terms of microfinance '.
Yesterday, Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor to the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man."
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th global summit of micro-loans in Valladolid, believing that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve a reduction of half of the number of people who live with less than one dollar per day, that is, an amount that sets the threshold for poverty."
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all parts of the planet and takes this task responsibly," stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure that better capacities and opportunities are created for the poorest and, in particular, for women," to whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have achieved many" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The micro-loan summit is intended not only to be a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic objectives."
Her Majesty has explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-loans was extended to Spain and other countries of the world after "the pioneer of Muhammad Yunus's ideas" stated the Queen and added that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition."
She described the father of this instrument as a "admirable idealist who set out to fight poverty." She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to become acquainted on the spot with his lending policy.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006 followed this experience. "In all these meetings, I was able to conclude a constant development, explained by the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title" head of the family "which was awarded to her in Valladolid yesterday" the movement of the poor. "
Queen Sofia ended her speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thereby allowing them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity "is an ethical imperative," which must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balloying, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty," and now, more than ever before, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, the micro-loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept of giving trust to the people to whom everyone else is closing the door. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city, which "opens its gates to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious."
CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig without any serious problems for the Chancellor and Chair of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it was only in the autumn, especially in order to satisfy the members of the party who consider government policy today to be lax to the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow to the Italians.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were opposed and 10 delegates abstained.
At the end of Angela Merkel's speech, several minutes' standing ovation, and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in a slogan: the answer to the crisis is' there is not less Europe but more Europe '.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time for change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon, allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal electoral law 'in order to give Europe one face'.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom is opposed, and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, the delegates rejected, by a large majority, the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's board of directors depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a strengthening of Germany's weight.
Concerned by the calm of the climate within her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to get Congress to talk about "small" European states or countries that are in trouble, willing to criticise arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of 'Franco-German friendship', Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she reminded me that there was a bloody battle at Leipzig 200 years ago.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon army.
What does fraud constitute in the event of incapacity for work?
After the aid, the UMP party and the government are launching an offensive against incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak on a topic repeated since 2007 on combating social fraud and solidarity redistribution.
As an escort to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, due to budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start taking aid in sickness.
In clear terms, without the company's consent, a staff member who falls ill would lose four days' wages, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: giving public servants one day of unpaid work incapacity (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the right-wing majority is also launching a theme of fraud, this time focused on malpractice linked to work incompetence.
"The checks will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will be returned," said Xavier Bertrand during an interview provided by RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of notifications seem somewhat disproportionate, given the truth about incapacity for work.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political onslaught that brought forth their fruit.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance companies), more than 237 million euro of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008, daily compensation, with EUR 11.3 billion, represented 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% covered maternity allowances and accidents at work and 54% covered incapacity, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which contains some deviations: another poll published in 2007 on Monster.com's job opportunities website showed that 75% of the 40,000 interviewed French employees responded that they did not choose any day of incapacity.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37,8% of incapacity was shorter than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and 1 month, 15% between 1 and 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no more predisposed to work incompetence than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence (for health reasons or not) in France was between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in incapacity at work is a very small part of the job compared to black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are small-scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused systematic checks to be carried out on incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that in 1.5 million controls, 13,8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacity of "unjustified or too long," i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity of more than 45 days, 11% of the "unadjusted or unauthorised 'cases were counted to 1,2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
Thus, a total of 169 000 "unauthorized" cases for several million employees who had incapacity for work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work on the black.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent between 9 and 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos put these words before Parliament and added that the hundred days given to his government by unity would not be enough to carry out this task.
"To restore our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," said the Prime Minister, when he gave his first public speech on Wednesday at the beginning of the debate to vote on confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit will be a "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is at stake, added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be around 9% of gross domestic product from now to the end of the year after it was 10,6% in 2010 and 15,7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, the leader of the right, Antonis Samaras, expressed his support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," stressed Samaras at a meeting with Members for his party of New Democracy.
We have agreed to the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are opposed to any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the Economy and the Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all the parties that would support the measures envisaged, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would sign nothing under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the expert committee
According to a report from the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are denied death.
On palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and taking decisions in that sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, involving six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cite the recent survey of independent agencies, the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada has ranked 10th, the study notes that "the meditation of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medication yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to Canada as a whole, whereas in the province of Québec, this number is the highest with 86% of the deceased in the hospital.
As regards the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who also controlled all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this de-criminalisation is causing any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or disagreeing.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday in teleconferencing more than numerous cases of these misunderstandings in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assassinated suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia.
Let us remember that, according to an investigation carried out by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out a message that the life of old or handicapped people is less valuable.
As regards those practising assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents consider that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear on the maintenance or interruption of patient care, the authors say the news.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it be stated in criminal law that the withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires professional doctors to be trained to respect treatment rejection at the end of their lives without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian medical institutions, the Commission requires it to be considered as euthanasia when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signatories as "extreme" because he does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would have had more than 18 years could ask to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who yesterday studied the résumé reports.
P. Deschamps also points out that it seems as if the authors of the report are building the autonomy of a person above all other values that shape the social image of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
The specialist in medical law, Margaret Somerville, also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as" a manifesto for euthanasia. "
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular the data of the report concerning the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. the Netherlands and the American State of Oregon.
The King of Jordan is calling on President Assad to resign.
Damascus is talking about "the plot."
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's followers manifested themselves in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and talks about a "plot" against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension of membership in the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring countries, took a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
Yesterday, King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to send power to Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at heart, he would have had to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
On behalf of his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian regime, which had been in business since the beginning of the year, had not been crowned by success.
"Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, with a reference to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is applying an increasingly hard line.
The United States enjoyed "strengthening the consensus against Assad and the dishonest conduct of the Syrian regime" following decisions by the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" to the repression in Syria, marked by Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, 16 civilians and 19 pro-regime forces have died in Deraa in the south of Syria during this time.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed "in shootings and concentrated gunfire from heavy machine guns in Jobar," in the Homs area.
However, at the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouall estimated that the country had "embarked on a way out of the crisis."
After all, he has responded live to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus's membership, which he thinks is a "dangerous move."
Syria "will not bow," he added, with assurance, that "the conspiracy against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently considering a "civil protection mechanism" and is planning to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also in favour of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he thinks is "paranoid."
The new special meeting of the League is convened tomorrow in Rabat to deliver an opinion on the crisis plan decided on 2 December, in which the withdrawal of armies from the cities plagued by divisions and the liberation of prisoners was envisaged in particular.
Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov considered yesterday the Arab League's decision to be "wrong," while China encouraged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but it completely avoided supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and victims of the Italians
The next head of the Italian government Mario Monti has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include "victims" in order to regain credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties before meeting with representatives of trade unionists and employers today.
It should build a relatively thin cabinet consisting of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the designated prime minister.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express his confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on financial market nervousness and asked them for time.
In "democracy, precise terms" as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that he was "confident that markets would be patient and understanding."
His appointment as President was initially accepted by the markets, but concern was restored after the unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should draw up a team involving mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to accept "politicians."
He expressed the belief that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the next election date.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini's new government will have Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti, after taking up his post, promised to act with extreme urgency and in order to make Italy a "strong link" to Europe again.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The European Union believes that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria business association Emma Marcegaglii, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, has focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot respect deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, "Professor" symbolizing, according to the editors, the "call for seriousness" and "other Italy," represents for Italy a "epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism."
Big Jane Doe will be the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place government bonds at EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Soviet scientist, Viacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop an atomic weapon detonator, announced on Tuesday an American NGO specializing in atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN Agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA communicated its "serious concern" regarding the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS, widely drawn from IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he should have been involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by means of an explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the centre to set up a company in Kiev producing "nano-diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was then to cooperate on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear indications that the development of Iran's detonation system" was based "on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency about this - worked on this technology during a substantial part of his career in the military nuclear programme of the country from which he came."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or little.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen very easily to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which, according to the FBI, were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses rise again," stressed Human rights First dealing with human rights, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of Paul Legendre's leaders.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these evils," adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports of "hateful criminal acts."
The "hate crime" in American federal law is the legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This rule of law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
On Monday, a website providing Twitter microblog services introduced design changes to enable its users to observe the activities of its followers, which is somewhat similar to its Facebook services.
New offers of "activity" and "name" enable you to better and directly know the activities of other persons who are watching you or persons whose answers ("tweets") are being monitored by you.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor your contributions, whether they sign up to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new Twitter face was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being extended to the entire network on Monday, she told the AFP spokesperson for Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, follow-Friday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
On the network, users immediately assess the importance of this innovation in their tweets differently.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"Activity functions will help me better track some elements of my Twitter," sent @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
entry of the golden rule on a balanced budget into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, in power in Austria, decided to enter the "golden rule" of budgetary policy into the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and to avoid a possible reduction in Austria's rating by rating agencies (AAA).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of the ministerial meeting in a situation where Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% laid down by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than those of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA +, we would have had to pay three billion euros more each year in interest," argued Vice-Chancellor and Secretary of State, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is therefore following the request of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where Heads of State or Government have strongly requested that, by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be entered in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model," Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 onwards the public structural deficit of the federal state may not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to put public debt below the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020 / 21 horizon.
♪ Strong only ♪
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
On Tuesday, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on foreign exchange markets if he only had to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we find excessive volatility" in the exchange rate yen, explained to the Senate of Y. Nodo.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to reduce the value of Japan's currency, which only recently exceeded the dollar record in force since 1945.
But only since then has buying investors who regard it as a "safe haven" has regularly increased in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and European debt crises.
The dollar again reached below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic level of 105 yen close to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it costs the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the proceeds obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they transfer them to the domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami wave that devastated the region of Tohoku in the northeast of the country, emphasized Y. Noda, who fears that this healing of Yen will not kill a fragile recovery in an egg.
The Third Economic Power of the World restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households burdened with disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan."
The Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the Vice-Governor of this institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that the BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" suggesting that no additional currency weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Issue Institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euro) and increased the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various securities to flood with liquidity.
Euro area:
Rates are rising, exchanges are failing
European indicators continue to undermine the risk of debt crisis.
Despite the appointment of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European exchanges still concerned about the stability of the euro area are now falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris at 10 o'clock, CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions surrounding the revenues from euro area countries' loans that are in trouble, stock markets worldwide continue to make only part of the recent profits."
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, the broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo exchange closed down by 0.7%, which it suffered because of the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the shift will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stable," says Mitsushige Akino, the fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This restarting of uncertainties about the future of the euro area is damaging to the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is worth $1.3570 in decline by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, the currency backed up after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party accepted a proposal at its Congress on Monday to assume the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries in difficulty without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday this morning, Italy's ten-year bonds yield is 6.85%, and Spanish ten-year bonds yield is 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates in South European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the euro area summit will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in an intentional line of markets when elections to the House of Deputies take place in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates (spread) between Germany and Spain's ten-year bonds reached a new historical maximum.
In anticipation of euro area growth figures
The statistical figures say that France experienced growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downward figures for the second quarter to a fall of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in fact, this is the fourth quarter that concerns economists the most.
On its part, during the same period, Germany registered growth of 0,5%.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 o'clock, while the European Commission has just drawn attention to the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over dogmats
If there is a topic that cannot be taken on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that occupies energy from the core.
The debate will only succeed if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will trigger a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 if we do not want to rid a large part of the world's population of an important part of life.
At the same time, the lack of fossil resources will need to be faced with in order to continue producing electricity, while forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a theme that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany itself remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case, however, in Belgium, which underpins its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which it considers appropriate to build only the power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by renewing the construction of one power plant interrupted after the crash of the Three Mile Island power plant.
If a German model based on renewable energies is ever presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
Berlin's choice will be reflected in the price of electricity, increased energy dependency on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions resulting from the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will experience all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European wind-power champion, of which 30% of its electricity is withdrawn, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, making CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65% or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the inconsistency of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay our electricity bill 40% higher than the payment made by French households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs represent a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has enabled the industry to build 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 successive jobs.
The heavily exporting sector is dragging a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad to international markets.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost 6 billion euros a year, which the country receives for the export of nuclear installations and services.
What kind of power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while planning the decline of its manufacturer?
When dealing with an energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, and that there is no evil one either.
The development of installations producing low CO2 emissions, nuclear installations and installations using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Department of Nuclear Security, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants, as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of security in their blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place under normal conditions of operation and remained without human sacrifice and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused reactor concepts and inexcusable human mistakes.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this crash as it did from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and engineers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AreEVA and EDF's competitors and loosening the way to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations take over the debate so crucial to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the overcrowding of police, courts and administration subject to a number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the "country of human rights" that France boasts.
Recently, it was administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of the Interior (see November 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses."
But so far, it has rarely been dismantled at an economic angle.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad agreement in this area between the left and the right.
On the right, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where 2 million immigrant workers are located" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invading the hordes of Polish plumbers in French territory was shared both to the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we encourage immigrants to provide.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to banality when he states that joint development will enable us to solve our "migration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be true in elections, but it is very expensive economically.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesising the latest knowledge of immigration (Excessive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
Limiting immigration is crippling growth and harming employment.
Concerns about the effects caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and put pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more of a complement than substitutes for French employees by carrying out work in sectors with scarcity of employees.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that are not attracted to French employees and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive effects on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between the French and migrants cause the arrival of immigrants to have a positive effect on French workers' wages and employment.
So Giovanni Peri calculated that growth in migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
In doing so, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been set up).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in Europe on average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, one immigrant who is 30 years old will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 in his lifetime to public budgets.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed a desire at the beginning of his mandate to come for missing growth rates "with valued teeth."
These teeth used to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The continent should remember this, after having invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, holocaust, gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece during the 20th century.
Some people could believe that it would be sufficient to make the choice and to make it as direct as possible in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies.
But it has been known from Napoleon that it was the ease of thought.
General electoral law, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient and can become a "instrument of oppression," as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organisation of separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as and since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The admission of a yes-no Greek referendum will have the value of double disclosure in this respect: the discovery of the need for a great return to political power, but also the unnerving sense of its impossibility, its impropriety.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganized.
A Bianca exposed to a European absolute monarch or a leap with her legs tied to an empty nationalist depth: what choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe bowing down to the dictate of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is an entire Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it every one of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty must be returned urgently.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to rid themselves of the market government, and to prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will anticipate decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After a long time of fighting against this socialist and Jacques Delors proposal, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage in European building.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
A revolution of interest couldn't have been enough.
This lesson continues.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contact-free" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere it opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world's chip card trade fair.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an increase in the world sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones) of 11% in more than 6 billion units.
The most carrier is a segment of contactless technology that allows you to pay in public transport or to deal with purchases simply by approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards should be sold worldwide against 320 million cards sold a year earlier!
Their share should increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After long been in the tow of the APEC countries, Europe gains terrain in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, beginnings are more modest: 400,000 visa-free cards have been issued.
But the big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million no-contact pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to classify a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically to their clients in future contact-free bank cards," reports Gérard Nébouy, the CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test pay by cell phone
But this is only the first stage of the future means of payment: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for the execution of transactions is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They're late."
"But their real boom should happen next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world of 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready to move forward.
Yesterday, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société of the Général announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay with a mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sector.
The long-term suspicion that there are volumes of Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Niger sector of Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Secretary of State Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had "gained confidence" from now on.
"The way both organisations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great cooperation between them ', he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January 2010 could help to shed light on the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by members of the AQMI from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by special French troops.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other leads to a man who is said to be close to the AQMI and sect.
"It is progress, but it is without doubt necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between the AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it manifests itself more and more actively," says Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwa.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by the AQMI.
Since then, the international community has put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
Indeed, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little good interest.
Quick success
Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in Haoussa means "Western education is a sin," approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The sect is being politicised and requires strict observance of Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are starting a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government's reaction, as usual, is still the same.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf sect is captured and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its position in the north.
At Christmas 2010 he will perform an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will die, then another in the capital of Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN's local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda has surrounded the Islamic Maghreb by Mali and the iger and Somali from Al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of emergency and ready to "pass on all information."
World by presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are overstepping in simplification and ignorance on issues relating to China, Iran, or helping Israel.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating the lofty statements and brief guidelines on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, or Israel's assistance intermingle.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race to nominate the Republican "Grand Old Party," threatened the occupation of the Chinese in front of the World Trade Organization and accused them of "tampering with their currency," which is a bearing topic in America fueled by the migration of entire parts of its industry towards Asia.
All the worse, if this must contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost got caught up in an attitude that "smoothes" emotions.
It required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is in the last place in the polls, remains unheard of.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in fanfaronic.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel's military assistance, accusing Obama of failing his duties towards this partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, proves the embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, because Beijing has "tried to develop nuclear capabilities" - clearly ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to hit Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far away from the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, the heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses for Libya, and thus attribute him to the weak
But the attack isn't easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which was removed by Ben Laden, rather positively.
Since Iraq, he has no confidence in military intervention that leads to impending.
And with the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking at the right place.
Nord Stream, a new Russian gas port to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline directly connecting Eastern Europe to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
They must supply gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte, turned together the control wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas will flow into Western Europe each year through the first pipeline of 1 224 km between the region of St Petersburg and the Land of Meckleburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, a quantity equal to the entire French consumption.
And it's already reminded of the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being led around the country by any third State (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries are losing a little bit of power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats to shut down its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
It was most strongly expressed by Warsaw when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying it's a politically sensitive subject.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created cracks between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia was only five years ago able to assert its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose deposits are coming to an end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," confirmed François Fillon in the ceremonial opening of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the large gas contracts of things are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom's leaders present in a large number in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with a concrete casing to protect it from the anchorages of seagoing vessels.
It rests at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
In its construction it was necessary to avoid minefields from World War II.
"For security reasons, almost a hundred must have been removed or destroyed," says Jens Muller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not cut anywhere on its entire length by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were very little eager to see Russian state society permanently settled off their shores.
"In the event of a malfunction, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute," Jens Muller states.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline will leak into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely to the contractor, for the welds were designed to cause leakage every 100,000 years.
The external control of the gas pipeline is carried out by an underwater ship-drawn robot, while the interior of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pressurised by gas.
At the end of the 3-day journey at a speed of 3 m / s, it shall provide accurate information on any deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to function for 50 years without the need for any repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains in charge, holding 51%.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15,5% each) as well as the Dutch company Gasuni and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has its registered office in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased this company for five years with a contract that can be renewed, all its gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will benefit from total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," Jens Müller states.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was secured by 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs thus increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will come back to them, because Gazprom is the only one who takes the risk.
The pipeline leaves the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the gas output gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskin - brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskin, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to give joy to writing again.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskin notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangle plates and its leaves of drenched white colour as if aged over time.
After all, Moleskin, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan at that time decides to launch a new design but distressed notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, a consultant working for the company at the time, is taking up the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of leather), which is used for e.g. to adjust the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskin returned to favor an old and forgotten object, which was the icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading person of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Sales increased by 26% between 2006 and 2010 to settle on 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskin crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to build some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook captures the businessman as well as the student or professionals.
The image of Moleskin is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirits.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early years, has almost a hundred of them today and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to a bookstore and through a chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the city centre, where he could assert his identity.
"We have watched the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, despite the turbulent development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the Moleskin notebook: the brand recently opened the exhibition "Tácházka," where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of a film festival in Locarno, she also presented new notebooks resembling a leopard.
Moleskin benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases... The brand extends to a variety of carriers.
Success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006 Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe Investment Funds, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the proportion of unemployed disabled workers so high?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today opens on the 15th week for employing handicapped people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the whole population.
Is it depressing?
"No, he underlines Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organises the week for employment of handicapped people."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of the unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
"Nevertheless, much remains to be done."
It should be said that for unemployed disabled people there are many obstacles to their entry into work.
These are older people: 37% are more than 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% of them are undergraduate and of 2.3 million university students are only 10 000 disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the handicapped compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent the 'core problem', according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of the Tremplin Association, established in 1992, to help businesses accept handicapped workers.
So much for objective brakes.
It remains unsaid, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slow.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that interrogated managers had a "poor level of knowledge of handicapped persons" with "an exaggerated idea of persons in a driving chair and mental or mental deficiencies."
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employing 6% of the disabled workers provided for in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures, which come from 2008, show a figure of 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, in charge of collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "fined 'enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59.000 guilty enterprises between 2007 and 2011 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The Law of 2005, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before they invite French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens on Tuesday night (20h45), they did not hide the pleasure of bringing them this friendly match.
We're not going to go that far to say that there was an association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other in the stands of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have simply and well reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in a fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," says the player of French Lille.
As for the difference between his performance in club games and national team games, "it's one and the same, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Gambling, investigated against Romania on Thursday night because of this struggle against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
You can't forget the term "joy."
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged since the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the 'special' nature of this meeting.
All the more so, because across from "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We crossed immediately."
"The power to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Leekens was also a good reminder of "pride."
"Proud" to fight "the game - the holiday."
"Proud" also states with the quality of "neighbours," that France, a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna, "has once again become a team of very high standards."
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he was so excited.
Although Belgium will be absent from the next European championship, a technical football player would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014 heading... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next match," including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is starting with great optimism against Bosnia Bosnian (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese football team, whose helm he has been at since 2010, has qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
One game left and one opponent, Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenice, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of advantage, but it was not able to score such a rare goal to ease it.
"It's a good result, however, which contains a risk, because we didn't score a goal out there."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of the audience, which should create a boiling boiler, although the match certainly appears to be "very balanced," says the optimist, but a bright-thinking bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are fully convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being on Euro 2012," yet relativated the successor of Carlos Queiroze.
The indecisive Friday's match in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A fiery match can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
"It is a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we did not score a goal outside," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that they "do not give them time to think."
A good idea, on the condition that he turns out to be realistic this time.
