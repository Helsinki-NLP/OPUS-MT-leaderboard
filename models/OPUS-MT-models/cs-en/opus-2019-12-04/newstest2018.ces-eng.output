The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Favorite of Color People (NAACP) has published warnings for colored people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory state principles and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay greater attention to cross-state travel as a result of a series of disputed racial-motivated incidents currently taking place throughout the State," says the Association.
NAACP stated that it has taken this step on the basis of the current Missouri laws, which make it difficult to defend racist acts in court, as well as as as a result of the conduct of law enforcement authorities, which are unduly targeting minorities.
"There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped only because of the color of their skin, are attacked or killed, "said President NAACP for Kansas City Star for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We have the largest number of complaints so far."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the US state.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated insults directed towards students of black skin at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances early this year after he ran out of gas when travelling across the state and the police put him in custody without charges of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent declaration by the State Attorney General of Missouri, which states that black male drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared - they should bring money with them for possible bail payments or warn their relatives that they are going to travel by state."
According to the current FBI program, there have been reports of hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, hundreds of cases of hate behavior, which puts the state in the 16th place among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of that law, which according to ACLU is designed to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for Foreign Countries, but recently the advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family doesn't have peace after 12 years!
The murdered is Sally Anne Bowman's model.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by Chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant where she worked, who gave her stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched a thorough criminalistic work on the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to prison in 2008 in the amount of 34 years for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only confessed in court to a juvenile assault, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted the attention of a taxi driver," he said falsely.
According to his testimony, the girl was supposed to defend herself for what she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's story was proven to be a lie, and she accused him.
After he confessed to Dixie, he talked about his horniness and his taste for a girl.
When he dressed her up after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light up marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, and that's what Dexia told the police himself.
He said he smelled adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth, "added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people on the loose who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," told the Mirror's mother Linda about the disappearance of the ashes urn.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrator costs tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are not prude or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague Intimity boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mareš.
It started in a quiet way, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling tour of Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of extraordinarily looking vibrator.
"Different moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with another partner with the German manufacturer of Fun Factory's design erotic tools, which impressed Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the partner left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today he runs an Intimity boutique in Prague's Benedict Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such a prude!
The Berlin Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like perfume.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to take up the Prague shop, where he should be and what his name should be.
The name Intimacy has been a fan of both of them.
"It has something to do with intimacy, and it is, to say the least, tender," he says.
There was a purchase of internet domain and a search for suitable space that went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the option that broke down the shop was won in the garden of pleasure and the bedroom that is dominated by the bed.
Dagmar Stephen from FormaFatal has prepared it for us.
We found space in 2013.
At first we didn't think he was ideal because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting on Intimacy again.
She's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so no one looks at the customers, "says Martin Raze.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a deal that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they even entered such a trade.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to the sex store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there's only a woman's service in the store, it doesn't mean that a man's foot won't come here.
Most of the time, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't tell the right size and choose bigger ones," Martin smiles at a common mistake.
Those are the prejudices, the clichés, that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessary vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black underwear, whereas women tend to tend to pink.
The absolute best seller is currently a product well called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a no-touch clitoris stimulator.
There is an adolescent need for me to giggle with admiration at what a serious tone my interpretation is given to me.
It's like it's not smirking.
And it doesn't really talk.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't believe he'd be so well-received.
It's some sort of revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a sea horse vibrator.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a couple vibrator, We-Vibe.
He completely demolished the taboo that may persist in some men, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Different variants are made," continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a popular category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a remote control in her hand and determine her vibration intensity.
On the contrary, the category of encapsulating vibrator is a certain failure.
At least in our house, then.
The Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrator, even though they may only use it externally.
In Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to tell if a concept like that would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men, "Martin thinks.
"We, too, have tools for them, but to a limited extent." Most of them are sold mainly by a masturbator, in this case by the Tengo manufacturer.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and experience during use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were a lot into erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," is explained to me.
The mundane one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and vice versa, they are taboo for women. "Just out of interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not a prude.
On the contrary, we are quite a friendly nation.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years old and "already has a certain experience with both sexual life and with some tools.
She comes for something nice, better quality to make up for her partner's life or herself. "Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka care so much that every product is convinced that it is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to go into the specialties of bondage and latex, because we do not have room for that either, nor it does not exactly fit here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid something like that would come up.
A lot of the products on the shelves really like them.
It is also given by the selection of reputable brands represented.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the said sea horse 'and this triggered a change in the whole sector.
It started to drop cheap materials and work with health care, other designs, different colors started to be produced...
The pleasant thing is that behind the design of some is the Czech Republic, which is the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I was quite pleasantly surprised at how many people buy their design stuff from Whoop.de.doo from Anna Maresh even though it's relatively expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus' marbles from Anna Maresh.
She has done a great deal of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present within the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started as school work.
It is now a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not a large production, it's a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may be going a little upstream, but I think it's important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It might well happen that in a few years we won't be able to produce anything anymore, "explains Anna, who agrees with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
A negative or a negative attitude is not met.
At most, people are embarrassed.
"But even they will start smiling." Currently Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer, which you can get a personal message for, and this year she also plans her own lubricating gel.
In the next year, there should be vibrating eggs and other news.
The boundary of healthy sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's okay lie.
Is there anything Martin March wouldn't sell already?
It's so hard to define.
What one finds normal may seem completely abnormal, so we define ourselves with a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them are going into any extremes.
Before we say good-bye, I have one last question: what was the craziest demand they got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in asking a lady to masturbate to her boyfriend with a natural, 28 centimeters long.
Well, we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
The question is whether anyone made fun of us, "Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
Even that happens from time to time...
A blow to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's!
His friend, Charles the Generous, is fighting a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend fights a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately it's true," confirmed the sad information to Lightning himself by the singer.
I know about my illness, and so far, under the circumstances, I can handle it.
"I take drugs to slow the disease down," he added, thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole branched-up family has come together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife is trying to be at home as much as she can, and her dad is coming to the house on White Mountain with his daughter from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa, and his son, Karl Charles, is taking care of her.
He fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Nightingale to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's had 60 chemo.
He managed to get back to work on the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I have a forecast from an astrologer that I will be here until 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of songs so I don't forget them," said Charles.
The same disease is now being fought in the institution by the actress Květ Purple.
Do you have a Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will assess the RTC.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be performed for health reasons either.
"I am sorry that the legislators have lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in Parliament for more than two years," said Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should receive a new President at the end of August, who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law will attack in court because it claims it violates the right of an unborn child to live.
The Members postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, Members approved the proposal and the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, the criminal abortion of pregnancy should cease in three cases: if the life of a woman is at risk, if the fetus does not have a chance of survival, or if the pregnancy was caused by rape.
Similar exceptions existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile, since 1931, before women were granted the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Other are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind bars who serve up to 30 years in prison for breaking up their pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, this was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The White House Trump is now targeted by the Statue of Liberty.
A false sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could tell it just as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue at Firdos Square, Baghdad, in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what was coming when, in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the presidential proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty.
It is fitting to add that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem of Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta with the words, "I don't want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that throws light on the world.
A poem which has been placed on the pedestal retrospectively, and to which you refer, is not part of it. "
Miller's actually right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
These are, above all, the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which reflect today's times - not only invites immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let the poor go down to me, who the poor, who the poor, who can barely breathe freely, who the poor worm in the midst of the full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these "wretched worms" on our screens than ever.
Miller was not trying to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of an extensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue, knew well enough that she was going into a high political game.
The statue should have expressed the connection between the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem, a woman's character is not abstract, but she has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: the mother of the exiled.
Merging a poem with a woman's imagination is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wing worshippers have long tried to reverse that meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan the Baptist in Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to a backward world: "The Statue of Liberty moves forward.
It brings out a torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States. "
Limbaugh, oddly enough, comes across an important thing.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of a exhausted and damned passenger who often, after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, comes with hope in his heart to a new country.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance of a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praise to Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team only had two Scottish members.
The head of the United Kingdom's athletic federation Neil Black said that a strong squadron of 16 Scots on the World Championship team would be a "huge asset to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the London 2017 World Series, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that something strange is happening in Scotland, and British athletic might learn a lot from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," said Black.
"I talked to the people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The leaders of Scottish athletic school think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.
That's what people on the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing. "
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000-meter race, while Eilith Doyle has been elected captain of the team.
"Eilish is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing, "said Black.
"Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came from a room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The passion and unconcealed feelings with which Eilish spoke were unrepeatable. "
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete to run over the obstacles at 400 meters at his fifth world championship, stated that it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The runner in the middle line Muir has set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
The MS will participate in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track on 1500 m. This season he won the British team races and annual games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team captain has led to the fact that she is "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues have made it to the team, but in many cases they will also attack the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is all about the pleasure," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves where we've moved to.
They're athletes who will think of the front spots on the stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it's a good one.
I merely pointed out that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'm gonna enjoy the incredible atmosphere. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: do not apply for public office if you do not accept voter criticism
Our country's father knew his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the papers to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he wasn't trying to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and the foolish and dumb will be led like sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on starting acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties for these crimes.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as unfounded, and a lot of "who cares" opinions appeared in the comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
It still matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not irritating.
As you can see, he runs his own state with certainty and strictly adheres to principles.
It turns out that it is also skillful in using Facebook as the main means to connect with its constituents - the exception is not even the publication of the first photograph with a bald head after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, designated as official and administered by its employees paid out of taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with Washington Post Hogan, spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor, saying that blocking comments took place from the post of moderation.
But using an image of Internet trolls, spamers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed some real people whose contributions were erased.
And that is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
The lawyer at Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Ms Ramani, asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current reports," she wrote in the section with the comments of the Washington Post.
"I do not like the idea that when a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are described as promoting the so-called collective effort, rather than being recognised as a larger group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam interest" would probably call "defense."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require the posting of workers on the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism, or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticised for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The President of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she stopped one of the voters from accessing her Facebook site.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who write under pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical papers collected by people in the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions in his office criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disapproval and intimidation lie within the very foundations of our nation.
And a true leader must accept that.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
The Czechs use more of their tariff abroad than at home.
They are the most popular in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse on the web, and usually do not have access to Wi-Fi under the umbrella.
Beach, bathing, and a smart phone in your hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of their operators at home prices.
This results from O2's recent statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the flat rate than at home.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum number of people travel during the winter, data consumption has even increased 50 times in this summer season.
In second place, Italy then placed itself in the list of data consumed.
The Czechs will call for the most minutes from Germany, where many go on business and during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia visits 800,000 Czechs each year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book to share experiences with a mobile phone.
The record was July 7th this year.
"Tens of millions of photos would fit into the transferred data," the mobile manager in O2 Silvia Cieslarová specified the details.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is located in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is the fourth and Italy the sixth.
We are going to Austria for hiking and active holiday, where we do not have that much time to browse on the Internet.
"In addition, over Austria, the Czechs are headed for the Adriatic," said Cieslar.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growth in data after the release of roaming charges, for telephoning, growth is much lower.
The number of minutes in roaming has increased to twice that of last year.
Germany dominates with a huge leap in front of other countries.
"Roaming calls are more used by business customers on business trips," said Cieslar.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
The former golf leader Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxed atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in East Lothian Scottish administration, which hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open in the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archer Links golf course on his way to the finals, succumbed to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of ambassador to the tournament on behalf of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," said Rafferty.
"Players will be able to enjoy a first-class playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen advocate of this game and he is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands. "
The Englishman Eales will first defend the title, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I have a good feeling about this," said the Southport golfer.
"I had no opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open, because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year, when my wife Sharon and I had a really big win.
It was a beautiful time I would never forget. "
Gary Orr returns to home land, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year.
This event will be his first participation since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said about Helensburgh.
"You want to do well and feel a lot of pressure.
I was really happy to play again, and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far. "
The three players will also be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance competition are among six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free of charge. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In its wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "note" - right into the fire.
After half an hour, he takes out the potato, and he likes to eat it with his unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she does her day-to-day work, such as laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof is substituting the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late nights is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. Moreover, soldiers are housed in the village.
"After 5: 00 in the afternoon, no one dares to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of the daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared a part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of public upheaval before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly reversed its anger against the Yakarta government, which controlled the entire region, except for foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and ravaged city, where you will reach after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach clutching with a ride.
Mass transport doesn't work at this point.
The town with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty colour.
There were very few Indonesian people looking at this place, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the Christians arrived, the locals worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Bardina, pointing at her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to wear leaves only."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and children's mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from American Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province approximately the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 did Freeport extract gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports the extraction of wood with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, this wealth is a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
The investigation conducted in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including an amount of $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the Papua Tribal Region during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as stated by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We will lose everything, the 2016 British Archdiocese report, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, raping and electrocution are particularly popular - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher from Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has been exacerbated by the fact that Papuan resources are attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% claim Christianity, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteen sells fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains the 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura Province.
"The original people of Papua - mama-mama (women) - so they lost their jobs."
In 2014, Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised a solution to inequality and violations of law.
The former carpenter secured and made his way to the presidential palace in the yakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papui, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope of answering our call for justice," said You.
The fact is that just two months after the October inauguration of Jakawi, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian motorbike soldiers emerged from the dead of night.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers mentioned this complaint and the tone by which she was spoken and later returned with four other soldiers, the local vicar Yavett Tebai.
Two of the drunk soldiers pursued a group of children and beat them with the arms of their weapons, presenting victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby Election Commission building, and on the following day, things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field outside the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came up with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waite dance - in which they run in circles and mimic the singing of birds - the Mee Pago Papuan tribe.
Several Protestants started throwing rocks at the buildings.
With increasing tension, soldiers were given an order over the radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot," according to TIME weekly in an official document, the content of which has never been published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali district, Kego Koto, recognized the imminent danger and called on residents to disperse into their homes.
But no one cared about his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said TIME weekly on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but in his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Young, was hit three times by his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," said the TIME weekly with the sad voice of Yohanes, who, like many Indonesia, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told journalists that his officers only "secured" the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman for the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many got away with injury.
The report on the murders went through the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would implement an out-of-court mechanism to resolve violent acts that have occurred in the past.
But almost immediately, excuses began to ring up.
"Most violent acts have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task, "he said.
However, in an interview of 5 June for a weekly TIME held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning on introducing any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All cases will be brought to trial."
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor - said that 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniai, had been settled so far.
The families of the shooting victims in Paniai welcomed his allegations with mistrust.
"In the last three years, I have been questioned four times in total, but so far I have had nothing," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many citizens of Paniai who are afraid to talk about the incident.
In his words, he was beaten by military members after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at the villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
The struggle in which one person died and the other 17 were injured occurred between the villagers and the construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravian Douw (24), who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing at the members of the rocks, and the response was a warning shot.
But the locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) started shooting into the crowd and killed one man.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said the 29-year-old Domingo Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous people from the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes that live in central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai. These include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papuai as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Oil is pouring poverty into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is just as unattainable.
The people here grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each one has four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport opened more routes and new immigrants started to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to get into business.
"Young people move from villages due to lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua because of the "lack of cooperation with the authorities," all despite the fact that they were given such a rare permit to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious eastern areas of Papua and Western Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and inclusion on the blacklist," he said.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - were urging the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian State Department, Arrmanath Nasir, shook off the charges when he told the journalists in Jakarta that: "In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people called according to a source that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto "we want freedom."
Further elections are scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of a robbery army - are lying in poverty, poor education, and a health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their vote as "debt," which Jokowi must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting, they continue the last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the victims' bodies on the property across from the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy picked up a huge supply of cocaine in Australia.
The French Navy has seized a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
A four-man crew of the ship was arrested during the intervention, which is probably made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed out of South America, and after being detained, the police dragged it to a port in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Service stated that it would seek, in cooperation with its international partners, to identify exactly where and where the drugs were coming from and to reveal the 'Lithuanian syndicate'.
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs going to Australia," said Cole Blanch, its CEO.
Drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive target for its smugglers because of high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first one these days.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, attempting to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, drinking needs reminding them.
The problem may be in the homes of the elderly, the solution, according to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Madlová, could be infusions of saline solution, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But they're only used in medical facilities so far.
The older you get, the lower the amount of water in your body.
"And in addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so that seniors generally accept fewer fluids and very quickly become dehydrated," said Madlová.
They should definitely drink two liters.
"But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem," she added.
She often doesn't think there's a doctor in senior homes to keep an eye on it.
He usually solves dehydration in hospitals by infusion.
"I think that even there should be introduced gradually to allow them to receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-litre bottles of saline can be delivered to old people in a day.
Fluid deficiency can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, there's also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with sheets, maximum cotton sheets.
Disposable diapers may also be a problem.
"It's more nurturing, but the ideal would be to occasionally expose the patient and let the skin out," said the doctor.
The Torch skyscraper was on fire for the second time in Dubai
On Friday, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers caught fire in Dubai. Firemen had to evacuate all residents 337 meters high and 79 storey buildings.
In the last two years this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Torch).
All the residents of the building have been evacuated and there have been no injuries, the cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor, "said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the skyscraper.
Dubai's civil defense said that firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4: 00 in the morning (0: 00 GMT), after which they continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for disabled people.
The incident could once again trigger a discussion on the safety of materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation initiated by the leadership of the Torch skyscraper after the 2015 fire revealed that the linings and external panels used for decoration or insulation were most damaged.
The British police said that the system of insulation and linings of the Grenfell Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in the June fire, in which nearly 80 people died.
The survey results show that more than one in five passengers to the United States are carrying prohibited items on board aircraft.
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20% of them knowingly or unconsciously carried out prohibited items through the control posts of the US Government Agency Transport Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have found out belatedly that they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition, or explosive.
The results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1000 queries replied - revealed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to travel knowingly with an object that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours flown compared to less than 15 percent of members of Generation X.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly expressed a sharp object through security, while 2.2% of the women questioned and 3.7% of the men questioned also admitted that they deliberately brought illicit drugs on board the plane.
The company stated that it was conducting research among passengers around the world in order to determine how many of them accidentally passed unauthorised items through airport control and how much it did on purpose.
It is no surprise that the majority of people who have transferred unauthorized items - whether knowingly or unknowingly - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what kind of fluids and how much they can carry on the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA seized the most of the currently banned fluids.
For some time, people thought that TSA would treat books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Fluid transport is permitted within domestic flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of the planned emission reduction directives of the Obama administration
After 15 states were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, its boss Scott Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes within his plan. He responds more quickly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge brought against his previous position at the federal appeal court.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October, when States should start to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the level of ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interference with local decisions or threatening economic growth."
Pruitt, who held the position of State Attorney General Oklahoma before being appointed head of EPA by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
A sudden Wednesday's turn is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executor exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with states through complex processes and the implementation of new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the rule of the previous EPA administration, it often did not meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and set up plans," said Pruitt, who, in his previous position, filed more than a dozen lawsuits on EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take fulfilment of the term seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that follows from it. "
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may, at a certain point, use "the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities' to ensure that regulation" will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information '.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcript of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has still not been passed by the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was head of the coalition of states that sued EPA this week, said that the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
"Turnover in CEPOL's views - following our litigation - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," added Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-floor ozone occurs when common harmful substances discharged by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in a solar atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to change the minds of those responsible and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological pull of Trump's administration to help polluters and special interests."
He spilled acid on a man, yet he's not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family laughing, the next minute your whole life changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopher from Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The Reuters website reported the information.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christopheros' house.
Andreas got up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents to the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
A man he'd never seen before in his life, right after opening without warning, he spilled acid on him and said, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I only felt incredible pain on my skin, "said Andreas.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones got terrible news there - doctors say he had no chance of surviving.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate into his wounds.
His wound was very serious.
Ninety percent of the time, the face that the doctors tried to put together was hit by skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A great complication for Christopher was the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most agonizing thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today, Christopher has had 12 surgeries that are far from the last.
The injuries suffered by the victims of the acid attacks, according to plastic surgeons, may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformation and deformation all their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesperson of the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The assailant was wrong.
As far as the attack is concerned, Christopher is sure that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
Because the perpetrator believed he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the whole case properly and then tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later on, the verdict on the amazement of the Christopheros family has fundamentally changed.
"In the end, the three judges concluded that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopher.
In the last few years, the number of corrosive attacks has increased considerably.
The Ministry of the Interior has expressed its views on the issue by planning to provide new guidance to prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
You should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But victims of similar attacks are not going to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose more severe and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for stricter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often available in different stores, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to Dubai's civil defense, the citizens of the 80-story building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out at the highest levels and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were sleeping.
The alarm woke us up, people screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," described the events of the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that about 40 apartments were caught in the flames.
At least two cars were destroyed on the ground when the burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to a civilian defense report, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
The extensive fire damaged Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over 100 flats.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, no one was hurt because the inhabitants were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and then it became the world's highest residential building with its 352 metres.
Another Dubai skyscraper took his record the next year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping compounds in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, there was a varied collection of illicit devices in a sample of 23-year-old Ippolita - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson 's disease or anorexia medication.
Ironically, even this wild mix didn't help him win the title, he ended up fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing four-year distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italy's rugbista David Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which until then was a record amount for athletes caught.
A third-class player started taking steroids in his words the year before he failed bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged her ex-lover passionately!
Lucka Vondráčková has hardly set foot in Czech territory, she is busy.
And it also attracts attention wherever it comes.
Her former lover Michal Longý, with whom she lived for three years, fell into her arms for the last time.
The actor was 12 years older at the time, and he was already longing for family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly didn't want to hang up her career.
So they went apart, but they stayed friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they were both in blue.
At first, they didn't notice each other, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she fell by the belly.
Then they hugged each other, and they were willing to pose for the photographers.
But their encounter was no accident, because they will play a couple of lovers in the new Primy series Captain Exner.
The Islamists have been sentenced to life in the UK for preparing their assassinations.
On Thursday, the British court put four members of the Islamist cell behind bars, who called themselves the Three Musketeers, and according to the prosecution, planned a terrorist attack against the police and the military.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had been convicted of similar acts before, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities thought he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "infidels," and a make-up gun.
It happened the moment the MI5 Secret Service agent placed a listening device in the vehicle.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror the defendants may have caused if they were not stopped," said the prosecutor, Sue Hemming.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, men claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then dismissed the defendant's claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In Hodonín, they measured 38,3 ° C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius only stayed on top for two days.
With 38,3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín, it was overcome by Thursday, which has become the hottest day this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
But there weren't a lot of heat records on Thursday compared to Tuesday.
On Tuesday, records of 35 out of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years were broken or even.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in the Keeper, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Břeclav Lednice, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths and in Pohořelice the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records came from 2013, just like the Keeper's.
It was ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Strážnice was the biggest heat in Dyjákovice in Znojemska and Broda nad Dyjí in Břeclav, where mercury was soared to 37.8 degrees, but the record failed.
On the other hand, for example, in Western and Northwest Bohemia, according to the ČHMÚ website, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures didn't start there until later in the afternoon," said the meteorologists.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade according to the ČHMÚ and more heavy rain could come on Sunday.
In most places, however, the temperatures will remain high on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China's missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without using the means of force.
They spend ten billion dollars a year supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing their entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is not doing well.
The state media there is talking about the plan to turn tourism into a driving force for economic change and modernisation.
Last year, however, the number of arrivals rose by only 3.8%, and roughly 80% of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, judging the situation in the world's most populous country, the professor of economics from the Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China; the citizens of the other countries have to get their visa in advance.
Therefore, at the Chinese authorities in the US, the crowds are comparable to the Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in line for it, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of the population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when it uses tourism to realise its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transportation to South Korea in the spring as part of the rupture around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year on year, while Japan grew by 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Central Bank, the Fed may have left China as much as $190 billion due to China's foreign trips, while China will receive about $35 billion per year in its currency sale to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on balance of payments developments, last year China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism, equivalent to 44% of the total Chinese surplus in the goods trade.
A small number of tourists, therefore, who are anxious to prevent a capital outflow, are causing a very painful blow.
However, the above mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
There are several cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has twice as much.
A number of scientific works show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
In China, however, you will virtually not find them.
It will be politically difficult to solve these problems, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian states, in particular India and Vietnam, have been making a great effort recently to simplify and lower visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, they multiplied deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Pilsen Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the cubs of three rare, deadly, poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine fresh-born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"It also grows meters long," described the spokesperson Martin Vobruba.
The chicks of the other two species, the reapers and the red cobras will be gaining strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australian vipers came into the world eight, they are descendants of a breeding couple from a population in the vicinity of Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the reapers from around Perth," said Vobruba, saying that in human care it is necessary for the reaper to winter 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a collection of African spitting cobras of red.
The couple at the Pilsen zoo hatched from four eggs, a total of four cubs.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobrub.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of four meters.
It's aimed at the eyes, can cause permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species feed on mouse pigeons in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they expect the cubs to hatch from a pack of black mamba, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of a phone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with Mexico and Australia's leaders.
In a phone conversation on January 27 with Mexico's President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American president blamed him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, supposedly saying, "You can't speak like that in the press."
Trump, as part of his campaign, promised to build a wall along the southern border and to announce that Mexico would pay for it.
He also leaked the transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement for refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama's rule - he would look like "drugged" after he proposed a ban on refugee entry to the US.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk testified again at the D.A. 's office about Smolensk.
"He has nothing to worry about," said the brother of the dead president, Chairman of the Government Party PIS Jaroslaw Kaczyński at Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," said Tusk, and read the country's current leadership that he is attempting to abuse the judiciary against political opponents.
On leaving the D.A. 's mansion, 24 crowds waited for Tusk according to TVN TV, which Donald Tusk chanted! and wished the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
In his words, the prosecutors do not blame, but do not doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against opponents, opponents or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He's been in interrogation for the second time.
The Prime Minister has been questioned at the prosecution for the second time, this time he was to be questioned about misapprehension during the autopsy of the victims of the Smolene disaster.
In addition, the bodies in the coffins were replaced.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there had to be some reason.
And the reason was that they were afraid of a scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relationships at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," said Kaczyński on the Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would thwart Tusk's chances of obtaining the most important seat in the Union, but Poland has absolutely nothing to gain from it.
At the same time, Kaczyński said that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not acknowledge it.
Tusk had an eight-hour interview with the prosecution on April 19th.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many considered his subpoena to be part of the obvious attempt by the Polish Government and the head of PIS Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by linking him to various scandals.
The prosecution is under the authority of the Minister of Justice in Poland, who acts as the Attorney General.
The subpoena for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as Head of the European Council, to whom Kaczyński tried hard but failed to prevent, inter alia, Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to revote on the composition of the House of Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices.
It follows from the decree regulating the delivery of ballots to foreign countries.
The State Department has prepared an update on it, and it is currently in a comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," explains the Ministry.
"New representative offices have been established in some countries, some offices have been closed or the level of representation has changed," it is written in the material.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which includes the representative offices to which paper ballots are supplied.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press version.
It's their list that's changing by decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs were able to vote, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also abolished its representation in the Malaysian Bamako and Japan's Kyoto.
There will be no election at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in the East of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the capital of Dakar and Zambian Lusaka.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation to include the Consulate General in Irbil and Chengdu, Iraq, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to select Members in the polling rooms at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the National Electoral Commission shall draw lots to determine the region for which candidates are to be voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when it was decided between South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, some 3800 people came to vote, around 6700 in 2006, four years later, 8222.
The early House elections four years ago came to the embassies of 10.571 voters.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: activists remember racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the watchers of Monroe, Georgia, and digged toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns had blocked it.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - long pulled from a cigarette and looked at the windshield of a car.
Inside, the passengers were shaking with fear.
"We want the n--and Roger!" a man yelled.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence breaks the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is simply a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over Roger's neck, the audience sigh with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have regularly returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kuklux Klan members.
No one has ever been tried for murder before.
"It is a wonder that in all these years no single person has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the reconstruction of the event, has been heard.
"It's a stain on our history and the burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call for action. Every year, the Monroe community is reminded that justice has not been done.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," said Brooks.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner covers one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files that received NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were scheduled to participate in lynching.
But no one has ever been prosecuted before.
Despite the fact that suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all citizens of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, the inhabitants of Georgia, for the first time ever, gained the right to take part in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And just during the summer election, according to the FBI, a black-skinned farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab the owner of Barnett Hester's white-land claim to be his wife.
In the city, Brooks said that Hester was loitering with Malcom's wife Dorothy and bringing her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the prominent owner of the white-skin property, Loy Harrison, posted $600 for Malcom.
Dorothy and cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
On their return from the prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects made their way through.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison," led by the FBI.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and hid the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks made his point more briefly.
"It was a massacre for election law," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all black people:" This is how you end up if you sign up and vote. "
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge has been organized for almost ten years by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is figurative, captivating and concise, showing deep-rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
It's not easy to watch this reconstruction, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it has a purpose.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so, we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," said Greene.
"But there can't be a relationship between us unless you hear what I've been through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the very first day about 30 actors - a dozen white people, the rest black people - rolled into a room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is performing as assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this because it contradicts who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, namely Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcom is arguing with Hester and blaming him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n-e!"
Rascon can't be helped.
There's a fight going on.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) explodes into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascone.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," says Greene merrily.
"I just don't think white people used to say" n-r 'in that tone. "
"Exactly," one of the actors shouts black skin.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility makes up for a sense of rapprochement.
They all want the show to be authentic, just to make it worth the four victims of the massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct expression of the word on N.
Now no one's laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of actors and sings Billie Holiday's grieving song "Strange Fruit."
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
Against the background of all this, about a dozen bystanders are wiping sweat and tears out of their eyes.
There are virtually the same number of black and white people in the audience.
One couple has travelled all the way from New York Ithaca, many of the bystanders are from nearby.
Each one of them bears the local wet climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks in line leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders could have been viewed at a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words of the song, Greene will be challenged by a crowd watching the body inspection.
Children kneel to the heads of the victims, watch fake blood and dead bodies, whisper something in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
A few minutes will pass, and Greene will thank the audience.
Actors clean up the rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actors and cries in their arms; in the end, emotions come upon him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know you hate the part.
But you had a reason. "
Later that day, the audience meets the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express her feeling about tonight's performance.
"It's hard to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... that people do that look like you and do that because they look like you," she said to rebuild.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic," she added, "it's just called police fighting."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in a courtroom, enjoying his dinner, talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear that we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it. "
I love instructions for use.
A friend of mine says only a coward reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything were rather a rare phenomenon.
So, for example, my first gramophone only contained one piece of paper that had hieroglyphs showing the connection of some parts, all of which had some secret tags.
After years, something went wrong inside of me, I offered the shaman's deed, who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a smirk, he told me what the labyrinth of the lines was good for.
Yes, it was a used device for chronic toilet paper depletion.
He found a loose wire and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl buttons again.
New times have brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply held on to the grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
A sketch with a description of how to insert one piece into the other was particularly good.
The kit was two-piece and another procedure was simply not possible.
To put it in reverse required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic parts.
My contempt for the manual ended up at my Seat Leon vowel.
The year of production of 2003 still had such a book with instructions for small repairs, which included, among other things, the exchange of light bulbs.
It was easy.
Three steps in total, and the work was supposed to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual failed to state that while the bulb on the right went to replace it really only in three steps.
1. Remove the cover.
2. Unscrew a broken bulb and screw a new one.
3. Insert the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of a battery housing.
At first I thought that by inserting the upper right limb into the bowels of the car I would pick up some spring, a screw, to which I would easily move the cover and then follow the points of the 1-3 saving author of the service book.
A bridge error.
The shelter had no space, no room for a thin hand of Cinderella, let alone an obese Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life without any success whatsoever.
The condition was still amplified by my wife's entry into the garage, which was called by a lyric and words that I hear very rarely from my mouth.
"What are you doing here?" she asked without a doubt.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss the vulgar terms, there are only two published words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked a sentence that could be her last in a long marriage.
I slowly explained the problem to her, and I placed the main emphasis on the torture process of the author of the manual, where the blessing of the hot iron on the hand which wrote the manual, and then its comfort so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of witch hammer instructions, including his agency burning on top of the Losin Castle.
"How about we remove the box?" the woman meant to remove the battery.
In pure despair this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of his collapsing state after checking on two of the state drug control officers.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field and who can also tell wild stories with an unexcited voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having put up a manual on hand washing," he told me in a weak voice.
I gradually dug the whole problem out of him, which was that he didn't have a picture manual to wash his hands over the sink in the patient's bathroom.
His argument to the committee officer that adults can wash their hands as a rule, and that there is no need for pictograms to handle the usual activity of decent people, it has no healing effect, and it has cost him considerable money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of the soapy palms of flowing water was a primitive act at the level of a cromanian, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
Then it must be said that water must be released from the faucet.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end is a joyful finding that a man has washed his hands exactly as he is ordered to do by the Hosudar of SOKL.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the toilet operation.
On the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, for urination, due to certain differences between the sexes, it will be necessary to post two instructions.
The problem remains the pictograms, since creating the perfect procedure also means an accurate drawing of all anatomical details, which could cause some outrage to the prude visitor of the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has wiped the hole completely with the wrong procedure throughout his life.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce the dividend in an attempt to revive the business
On Friday, the British educational group Pearson stated that it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, is followed by the company's previous decision to release 4000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of another £300 million ($394 million) in May under the third cost reduction programme in an attempt to resurrect declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company that agreed to sell its stake in the Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack of the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Kabul, Afghanistan. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, official officials reported.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, reported in NATO's statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died in the attack in Qarabagh County.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bombing - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in an explosion in the Herat mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In its statement, NATO stated that the Tuesday explosion occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, had been attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement also states that all wounded soldiers are out of harm's way of life and are located in an American military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice web link: https: / / www.interpol.int / en / notice / search / un / 1427578
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people in the Shia District of Kabul killed a car bomb.
The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city centre killed over 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to help military forces and policemen in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have shaken the public's confidence in government, regulation and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin in recent weeks.
EPA reconsidered its decision to delay smoking rules in response to the lawsuit
The US Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the Obama administration law, which ordered states to cut emissions just a day after 15 states sued the Agency.
The CEPOL announced its decision to refer "Ozone Standards 2015 'in Wednesday night, with the words that it submitted an undertaking by the Agency to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and hear their views," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in the statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the efforts of EPA to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine, on the basis of measurements, the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 of most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a suit on Tuesday on the grounds that EPA negotiations are illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
But the efforts of the new government have begun counter-measures by democratic and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA on its website states that ozone-containing air breathing can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood was flowing!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event on Czech terms, to which he hosted such leading personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krain and many others, and nobody else hosted the event but Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show yourself to the public and to present your music video to Sara, whose baptism was attended by a person of just name.
But few people already know that the recording of the video that took place in Russia was not without problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it didn't go without the embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, in the video of the singer's rival, he was supposed to give a slap.
But at one point he hit him so hard and right in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, immediately my nose was bleeding," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers made up the situation on the set that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav failed to respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not severe enough to affect the continuation of the next shoot.
We now bring you the mentioned video of the young artist, you can also record the scene with a blow.
A failed version with blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting light boxing match, met for the first time on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - an undefeated heavyweight champion of the World Boxing Council - came down to the hall where Lomachenko, World Boxing Organization, welcomed.
After Garcia's victory, based on a unanimous decision against the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday's Showtime, both boxers made the list of the top five heavyweight boxers.
Garcia pulled out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck. "
Lomachenko is defending his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN at 7: 00 on Saturday.
Boxers pose for photographers and the manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former cock-weight champion," says Garcia.
"I had to gain weight because of the fight with Broner (67 kg), but I'm not that big.
I'm a little short on my 60 pounds.
I'd like to go back to the light weight category.
Lomachenko needs to put on some weight again to make it easy... then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
"Why don't you tell them?"
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxu would be good for this game."
Klimas made a request for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should complete his debut in light weight at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed an interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on 23 September for a light weight title in the Forum arena.
"The match should take place in the style of payment for viewing, that is what fans want," said Garcia, who later said that the opportunity to broadcast the game is open through the television station, which will come with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw that kind of attention to themselves.
We'll wait for the right opportunity... "
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could participate in his Saturday game.
Lomachenko, however, could not be lulled by Garcia's praise when he said that the champion of the three divisions of Riverside looked "very slow... I'm sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension before the duel.
"You won't forget this game.
No other game is getting that much attention.
And with great comfort I will add to the fire, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game. "
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
Their car was just found at the bottom of the Volga.
The couple of young Russians Ilya Zirnov and Kira Cherkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There's been an extensive search for them, but no luck.
And in the end, for lack of evidence, the police ended the investigation.
The families of the lost couple were uncertain that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad ending to the whole story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the river Volha in the town of Čeboksara in Čuvašsk.
Thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify a couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without them, it would take the police a lot longer to identify the found.
The couple were last seen when Zirnov borrowed his father's car to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous so far.
He reported his finding to the Chooksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation shall continue and further details shall be published after the investigation has been concluded.
Latest results of tests for setting the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers' tests in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people have been questioned as over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rèttsmedicinalverket) began to carry out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the framework of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Sverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted a total of 2481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 to investigate 6880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results.
80% (2002) were assessed as over 18 years of age, while in the next 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the respondent was "possibly older than 18 years of age."
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was "possibly under the age of 18."
Tests shall only be carried out if the age of the respondent is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ ¶ ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics stick to the old tracks and the numbers are very similar," he said for The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the person questioned was 18 years old or older."
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would be 18 years old this year.
A medical method of determining age was also found to be critical, which includes X-ray of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is involved, among other things, in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person underwent puberty.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise, "said Metro for the newspaper.
The forensic medical agency Agency's GÃ'ransson advocated the decision: "Generally speaking, the risk of misassessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person questioned is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10% of all questions. '
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump, on a January phone call to Mexico's President Enrique Pena Niet, threatened not to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that the funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be provided from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This results from the transcripts of the interviews that the Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican President shortly after taking up office as Trump Peña Nieta, he was undiplomatically reprimanded that he was critical of his plan to build a wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You cannot say this to the press," said Trump repeatedly in an interview on January 27 and threatened to break contact with the Mexican President if he continues to make defiant statements.
They say the funding's gonna work out, and it's gonna work out.
"But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I no longer want to see you gentlemen, because that is unacceptable to me," said Trump, according to the American daily.
The wall was called the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it may be the most important thing.
The executive order to build the Trump Wall was issued shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a wall of 3200 kilometers in length, which is why both countries' relations have escalated.
At the end of March Trump said that the project will be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also informed about Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
To that end, he was forced to exchange views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the acceptance by the United States of persons from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but later he agreed to it.
"Surely you can say that this is not the agreement you have created, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump appreciated the Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation escalated.
"I hate the reception of these people," Trump remarked.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people to go work for local milkers," he said.
He also pointed out in the interview that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
At the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, Trump had telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
In the end, the call with Turnbull called it the least pleasant one in a day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father looked up, too.
The execution took place on the square in the capital of Yemen Sáná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari as his victim, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has hit an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd who gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi has been convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, shouting "Long live justice" along with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was dragged out.
Cops tied him up on his stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired at close range.
The crowd here celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr. al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia's law prevailed," he added.
I was standing in Sana Square, waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
Me and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hateful madness, grab the killer and lynch.
The execution was ordered by a court under the authority of the Shiite Houti.
Initially, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes right after his arrest, but his actions caused such outrage that the judge decided to take the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
She knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, she discovered evidence that a man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family had no enemies, and the injuries that carried Rana's body were terrible," he said to the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we looked in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held and demand immediate punishment.
A representative of the Justice Department read a record of the investigation to the crowd present to calm them down.
The accused did not appear to show remorse for his actions.
Right before the sentence was served, the police read his sentence, but the condemned only took a quick look at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were a lot of footage on the Internet that was taken by the crowd.
Governor of West Virginia has announced a change of political party
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at President Trump's assembly Thursday night that he was going to another party.
"Like it or not, the Democrats turned their back on me," said the governor of Justice.
"Today, after long prayer and reflection, I tell you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer support you as a democratic governor."
A crowd of bystanders exploded into joy.
"Tomorrow I'll join the Republicans," added Justice.
"As coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at the West Virginia assembly.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, the only billionaire in the country was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The defection of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party, which puts obstacles in our way rather than raising our country."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is the last straw for an already miserable party without a leader who is in vain seeking to find a positive and uniting report," said President RNC Ronna McDaniel in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "sincere" apology for the doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated once again that it was not the right time to return Russia to the sport world.
The head of Russian athletic Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Athletics Championship - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
In spite of his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report indicated that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think we have seen a very honest response and presentation today," said the President of the IAEA Sebastian Coe.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and worked hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation."
Coe said that he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have progressed to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to preserve the sentence that has been imposed on Russia," added Coe.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilise the situation.
Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest, "he ended his speech.
At MS in Athletics, which starts Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have fulfilled the strict rules of the IAAF.
On Monday, the Head of the IAAF Rune Andersen Crisis Staff said that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still unsatisfactory and excluded coaches continue to operate, told reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF board.
The state contract CzechTrade was obtained by the company František Savov, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was obtained by the publishing house František Savov, the Young Front.
The officials awarded him 100% of the points in all quality criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his release to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade launched a four-year contract in April to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A contract with a total value of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publisher Young front of entrepreneur František Savov.
In 2014, Czech police accused him of tax evasion and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov has fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his release.
The case was alerted by the server Current.
According to the original criteria CzechTrade was to decide on the price offered and on the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
It was Savov's company that helped the second criterion significantly.
According to information Dotyk.cz she received 100 points in all subcriteria of quality.
It was the result that she was moved to the next candidate, Vltava Elbe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with an amount of CZK 404 900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324 350.
In contrast to the Young Front, however, it received an under-average assessment from the assessors in all quality criteria, 62 points in total.
Tendru also participated in the consulting company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Updatálne.cz under the publishing house Economia.
The VLM published several objections against the outcome of the tender, with its assessment considered unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it decided to contest the competition with the Office of Competition Protection of the ÚOHS.
He believes CzechTrade was in violation of the law.
"The appellant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public procurement contractor on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly the preferred participant of the Young Front, a.s., at the expense of the promoter and other suppliers," it says in the proposal to initiate the procedure at the ÚOHS this week, published by the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the VLM Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an uncredible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Each independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," he said for Currently Klím.
CzechTrade has yet to comment on the situation.
CzechTrade does not, in principle, comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published by the contracting authority in accordance with the law and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"A full written report will be published after the end of the contract, but during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on it," said Dotyk.cz media representative Štěpán Dlouhý.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economia intervened with an article in Upstaalne.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this was mentioned in that Article.
In tendra, what might have helped her was that she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was first won in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martim Cuba ODS.
František Savov is guilty of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions by his companies, which caused alleged damage to the Czech state of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrei Babiš, is behind his criminalization, under whose influence Mafra publishers are responsible.
Last year, the London Court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have still not received any information from the UK regarding the acquisition of legal power of the judgment," said Spokesman of the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, Štěpánka Zenklová.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was based in Cyprus, which was the owner of the Czech-Budějovice brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying at risk assets.
It should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of assets from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker was on the pavement and the park, ended up in kotrmels.
The biker was attracted to himself by reckless driving on the streets, pavement and park paths in Ušovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to take her in the direction of the station.
"The police followed the city with extreme caution when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lazne and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," said Police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, which transported the injured biker to Pilsen Hospital.
Then the police discovered that the biker's driving licence, the motorcycle registration plates were stolen, his serial number was cut and the production plate itself removed.
It's so possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The presence of alcohol in the driver on the spot was excluded by the breath test, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," added the police spokesperson.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The rules limiting the financing of European football clubs will not in any way interfere with Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The financial fair play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million only to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will claim a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions for Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a rich Qatar family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts to buy players, but, on the other hand, they have to prove legitimate sources of income, allowing them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after being placed as Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were owed in pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, FFP's rules redirected its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend a hefty sum on players to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
In the current three-year test period ending in 2018, clubs may report losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Cheferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," said Andrea Traverso, the Associated Press last week, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules.
Although the PSG paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, it may spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer can be broken down into EUR 44,4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of FFP's highest sanctions hit the PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi.
The PSG fined EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and the order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is careful about teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatar company is sponsoring the PSG once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
In 2014, UEFA decided that the amount of funds provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar's income in the PSG could be paid by the MS Organizing Commission in football 2022 in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the leaders of MS 2022 in Qatar denied the fat that Neymat should become the ambassador to MS in football and that such maneuver would easily reveal UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's insider statement, UEFA has not initiated any investigation into Neymar's transfer to the PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as it was not entitled to comment on the PSG situation, the Associated Press stated.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchanting and selling jerseys.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
The leaders of the Spanish League, clearly concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG would violate FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of" financial doping 'of the club and of the state, "said the president of la League Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG by the Qatar syndicate.
Arsenal's manager Arsenal Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports mogul, shares La League's position on the club's financing.
"It is the result of ownership that has changed the football world from the ground up in the last 15 years," Wenger let himself be heard on Thursday.
"Once he becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club. "
Spartan Backup Rosický: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand floating fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the set.
Same scene as the Bohemian game on Sunday.
The Spartan Backup moved the game against the Crilled Lighthouse, invented several goals, but his teammates did not aim into black.
The flight team, pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the opening match in European cups.
Was it hard to do anything else with the game after the goal of Belgrade?
After the score, four of them needed to be scored, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted to lose, raise our confidence, so that we had something to bounce off to the next match.
We had our chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the game for so long?
The game is so worked up.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we fired a half-time shot like once.
That is, of course, very little if you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final period.
But you have to push your opponents into positions like this more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains of creating a new team.
We only played three competition games, and the lineup keeps changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging that you've already played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition is going to turn out and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, there's no other way.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta made a decision, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was once again a wonderful visit, just like with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
To do something that they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing each other, so it's not an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, a businessman is supposed to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is expected to serve 10 years in prison for tax cuts to a considerable extent.
The damage calculated is CZK 645 million.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary violated his fundamental rights, that the facts of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges found the complaint to be unfounded and found the CTK from the court database.
The TSA is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as the fourth instance, assess the errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a breach of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," says the resolution.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, it was also at the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage suffered.
The Supreme Court has described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of World Service's Board of Directors between 2005 and 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million arose only during the period January to July 2008, the total leakage, according to the expert, exceeded a billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, they paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
The World Service and some companies with which the company has been trading have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomír Přísláral, whom the judiciary has appointed for VAT machinations in fuel shops for 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court a while ago.
The series "Summer for Life" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string
This story iteration is nostalgic for characters from the famous' 80s; and for the dirty '90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter put the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd ran for bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is an easy parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the point of view of franchise, it looks like someone's out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (an example could be the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, which was concocted by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors diverted from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel of "Ten Years Later," in which adults play not so much on emotional level and satire is sometimes sporadic, including a parody of thrillers from the 1990's as "Hand on the cradle."
At one point, the character finds Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "a lot of other stuff from 1991" in a pile of junk.
Many of the main stories are repeated.
A kind-hearted Coop (Mr Showalter), now a writer, has still not moved past his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
Especially fun to watch forever young Rudd with long hair, aka Matt Dillon's character from Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
Franchise could start up moments of random madness, such as the Seven Up series coming back, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical resolution: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene, the whole group sets out for the premiere of "Summer of Life."
In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: Cold War revalism of the series "Such normal Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regret," and even the series "GLOW" in which icons of the eastern and western wrestling scene collide.
The comedy of the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, is supposed to act as a television set: the drama of two Bucharest policemen from Romania of the 1980s who are fighting for truth and atheism after the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and idealistic Isosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Street, which were dubbed into the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (like police officers watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
Many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - gave their voice to the series.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a killer with Reagan mask - and it looks like it is.
Six long episodes are too long, and comedy moments aren't enough.
With shorter footage, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, where two fat men eat hamburgers stacked up in a big pile.
A clear message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
Romanian creators were right: we do so with our own culture, as well as theirs.
Russian athletes have not been able to get rid of the iaaf launch ban.
The International Athletic Federation of the IAAF at the London Congress confirmed an extension of the international ban on the launch of Russian racers due to a state-supported doping program.
The vote at the stage of the World Championship, which will start on Friday, has been very clear, as expected.
There were 166 delegates to extend the ban, and there were only 21 votes against it.
First of all, the main reason for the rejection is that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before the Congress by the head of the Special Investigation Group of the IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some of the older doping cases remain unsolved, many suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and there are still coaches working in the country with a damaged reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-doping Agency, is not fully operational.
However, Rusada can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said the chairman of the IAEA Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians will participate, who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
But at the championship, they won't be able to start in national colors, and if they win, they won't play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will hold the interest rate to 0,25%
The Bank of England should, as expected, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following modest economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has suffocated speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to remain "behind" in the context of maintaining interest rates - despite squeezing family budgets.
The politicians of the Committee on Monetary Policy (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain an interest rate of 0,25%. The results of the vote for an increase in the interest rate supported by a slight increase in economic growth.
In its annual report on inflation, the Bank predicted growth at 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue; the Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that there should be growth over the next few years as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that the rent on movable assets should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was intended to support the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, from next February, the fixed-term financing plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start to apply, although the Bank of England said that it will now offer £115 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: "The MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with the pressure on real household income and consumption burden."
On the subject of tariffs, the bank said that it would be necessary to "tighten the belts of money policy" to calm inflation, "to a greater extent than the markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual 'and" limited'.
The Bank has reduced the growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried hope for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it should be slightly increased, according to the bank.
The latest report on inflation is a slight consolation for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases.
The report also states that monetary policy 'cannot prevent' income cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly 'towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow because of its great interest in British goods, thanks to its weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after the rates were reduced to 0.025% last August in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a decline in the pound.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will last at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which was putting ever more pressure on households; three political officials demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Last month inflation fell back to 2.6% of 2.9% of June, despite the fact that the bank stated that it expected such a change and that inflation would rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess over 2% of the target was "entirely 'as a result of the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Due to the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only rise once creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook at the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and mortgages - there are free options in the offer, as well as low rates that they enjoy. "
NHS prescribes controversial HIV medicine to 10,000 patients
Patients have been given access to "transformative 'treatment for HIV prevention since September, following a decision by the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the probationary period after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court of last year, stating that the NHS had the funds to pay for the PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England from the mouth of Director General Simon Stevens as a "major intervention ', while National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a" decisive moment'.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will be connected in October and by April 2018 will be fully implemented throughout England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug administered before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that the PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among patients at risk.
Pre-sex application of the PrEP means that there are sufficient specific medicines in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The patients tested include homosexuals or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign the consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also register in their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will cost taxpayers £10 million, and the NHS of England signed a contract this week to distribute drugs after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of the PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: "This important intervention should complement and make full use of the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges for human health. '
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT (National Aids Trust) said, "We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If the PrEP is administered correctly and the patients are threatened, it will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients who are at high risk of HIV infection with a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and is not subject to any need to talk to a partner, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement. '
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to every patient.
We now have the PrEP trial drug and are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection. '
The shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of the PriEP.
It is now important that we start tests as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to end the spread of HIV in society together. '
Life on high foot: the mezzanine and smart design turned this little apartment into an earls court spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate banker, traded a big house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment on Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is an illustrative example of modern design, which uses the maximum space available.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same height of ceiling.
I fell in love with him right away, and on the same day, I nodded on him. "
Since then, an apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-bedroom apartment with complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage spaces and a mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, big windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands, "she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the Duck & Shed Design and Design Studio based in Notting Hill and used an almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such height as to fit two gaps above each other - the challenge for architects was to create an intermediate floor on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only a matter of building a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that at the correct height above and below the ceiling. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full rooms on himself - while adding to the dramatic.
On the mezzanine the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storage of cutlery and jars.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Tilt kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," says Erfan about reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is equipped with counterweights to roll away very easily."
Thanks to smart use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a living space - or an appreciation of your property," said Erfan.
"The real estate agent essentially when entering the apartment calculates its price on the basis of the residential area."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," added Erfan.
"You're not gonna love the wiring in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts won't win. "
As it turns out, a quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an extraordinary work.
And like Joanne, you can decide to stay in the end.
The United States is uniting.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on its citizens travelling to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee paid her back and declared a retaliatory ban on his citizens travelling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word; US citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.
It is that California has banned spending state money on its citizens' travels to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for the LGBT and considers any expression of opposition to the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted a law of reservation of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients from the LGBT community is not obliged to provide it to them, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states, in turn, have adopted laws according to which religious charitable organizations, which received from mothers after birth for adoption, do not have the obligation to provide these children with uniform couples for adoption.
Due to these laws of reservation of conscience, California has banned the funding of its citizens' journeys to eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have trips to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas paid for by their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel for tournaments or competitions to Tennessee, for example, with financial support from their schools.
They either need federal grants to travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and his parliament has passed a resolution that he doesn't like California's high-tax policy, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but he still doesn't impose travel embargo on California for it.
He's putting them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to every Union State that would order a similar travel ban on another State for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, none of it is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money goes to and what it is not allowed to do.
Second, what's wrong with the reservation of conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why not just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of punishment, force him to sell pork when butchers offering pork are enough?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and leave him alone and order the relevant cakes from hundreds of bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all Federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies, which are not federal, to their own preferences.
Then there's diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas, and seven other states to be California!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community live by the rule and let all reasonable people live by it, but some activists strive not for tolerance to themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one must ever show moral, religious or philosophical opposition to the LGBT lifestyle again, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They're modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know the situation in American history where states have deliberately done this on political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in times of civil rights struggle for black people, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political causation was slavery, and there was a war on the North against the South.
Of course, there will be no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic and red Republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disintegrating.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic got a greasy ticket.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules before the presidential election next year.
The court fined him for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to apply for the post of head of state in March next year.
Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling on people to demonstrate through videos placed on the YouTube Internet portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny cannot take part in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of fraud.
However, Navalny, who is considered to be a combatant against corruption, considers the judgment to be politically motivated.
The court also imposed a fine of 300,000 rubles, i.e. 25,000 rubles on Thursday for two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny joined Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
Authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing from Kirovles.
In May, the verdict was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.
The sentence is so final, which prevents the Naval from running under Russian law.
Brothers fighting for an empire worth over $500 million.
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire by their Italian family, are pulling one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides at Toorak Manor, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who caught up with a dispute over common property and business assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the sharp feud is constantly being debated before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, his own brothers total 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first shop bought the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family was founded by Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold an entire company in exchange for $85 million.
Other properties and portfolio of the De Lutis family have been purchased for money now includes offices, building sites in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who, in Paul's words, is "an important driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court files state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
It was the division of assets and funds that became a problem for Paul.
"Colin's proposal sounded strongly in my eyes in his favor," Paul wrote in a sworn statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul said he cut off Colin.
Colin contradicts the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of misdealing with certain properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian background dictates that family is the most important," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Keck Cramer Charter are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defense attorneys.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had run dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and in the 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
With the money obtained by building the property, they bought the property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a young, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that, along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of assets to sons would go well.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family's group of companies. Colin said that Mark was compensated for $10 million on his way out and Luke was compensated for $26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, "they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL, as stated in his 2015 autobiography, Eddie McGuire, a famous television personality and best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied through a text message, in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, "I have nothing to add to that."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin stated in one of his statements at the Court that he was attempting to adapt to the requirements of his brother.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he let himself be heard and added that "he still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was in sight.
"Our disputes will be resolved soon by court proceedings," Colin wrote.
Hot in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower babies.
The public transport drivers like water and summer clothes.
In the kindergarten of Na Chodovec in Prague 4, where about 35 children now occur, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and the trees planted do not yet provide a great shadow.
There's no pool, but teachers shower in the nebula.
In the afternoon, the children remain in classes where the blinds and the curtains are closed.
The air is trying to cool off with the air cleaner because they don't have air conditioning.
It's hard for teachers and chefs, too.
"The temperature, which is both interior and exterior, exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergarten, so we should not even have open operation during this period," said the principal of the kindergarten Miloslav Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in the nursery, where it says the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We open the morning after 6: 00, the windows close, and we have the blinds on the south side to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hraz in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut, under it is a table, and there we do all sorts of things," said the director of the kindergarten Barbara Kompana.
The teachers are trying to go to the woods with the kids, where it's cooler.
The children's wet hats and the program have different games with water.
"We have a hand pressure sprayer, which is used for flower spraying, and we use it for showering children," said Kompanová.
Also, the principal of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street at the Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that the teachers tried to keep the children in the shade and sprinkles them with water.
"We have a relatively large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3: 00.
Every child has to wear a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose for example a low-sweetened tea or diluted juice and in the garden they have water saws.
They also have a vegetable salad every day and they always have fresh fruit and vegetables for their snacks, sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"For example, today a mother brought here about 10 kilos of watermelon for children," said Makovičková.
Drivers get water or a summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
Tram and bus drivers' cabins are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková.
In addition to cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tramway tracks have not been seriously damaged.
There was minor damage in the loop at the Hostivar.
At current high temperatures, we ensure that drivers have sufficient drinks at their disposal.
"Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and roads," said Rihková.
The workers have so-called sodiums in the road and some of the alternating places, which produce chilled sodium.
Drivers also receive soluble ion-resistant drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," added the speaker.
The hot and dry weather of recent days results in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firemen in the whole of the Czech Republic liquidated 108 of them, twice the long-term average of the day.
On Tuesday, during the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firemen were mainly employed by fighting fire.
"There are fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with the harvest works," said the fireman's spokesperson Nicole Zaoralove.
Even the evening change of weather did not bring relief to the firefighters, when heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and torrential rainfall.
In connection with the storms, the fire department was on its way to 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing the trees and branches that were seized.
"They intervened most in the Central Bohemian Region," continues Zaoralove.
But it was also necessary to help the firefighters in Creations in Czechoslovakia, where 60 people from the children's camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added work to Prague's rescue workers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances went to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the curry.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warning the rescue workers.
Carbon monoxide is a odourless colourless gas which is released in an imperfect combustion process.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media diet
Before him, many tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Political Portal said that the new Chief of Staff in the White House plans to limit President Trump's flow of information - including news on television - in the hope that he will keep Trump afloat.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met on his first day as a new employee, he outlined the key issue of the White House Trump, which he intends to correct: incorrect information that comes into the President's hands.
Kelly announced to the staff that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or on the spoken word - because the President can make a better decision on the basis of the correct information. "
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but a lot of his predecessors broke their teeth to control Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump was upset as a candidate with honest reports, it was convenient to show him that in a positive light he was spoken of by many other media, which was easier to convince," said Politico Sam Nunberg, a former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmeri from Politico then wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least in the words of six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that praise him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something other people don't know about - Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't checked.
We'll most likely never know about the tweets Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts were in vain.
But no one has been able to stop Trump regularly from inciting controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by subjecting Trump materials - which may or may not be reliable - to support their world view.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the advisers' tendency to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of the following information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials claim that the president often responds very angrily to negative news from the media, especially information leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the President a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of many leaks' from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was banned forever from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already made false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement the system for managing and documenting information received by President Trump."
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push through the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just disappear, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These unchanging factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to "Millionaire Quarter"
Several of the most wealthy homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again fighting with determined tourists who negotiate with local authorities the right to regain the field behind their homes.
Tourists have parked 20 trailers in a field near a thriving street in Solihull, which is known as the "Millionaire's Quarter."
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravan, tourists return after being banished in May. They were not even afraid of the ditch that was dug on the spot by the authorities' orders to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found gaps in defense and penetrated the fields with the caravan unprotected by the gap that served for the journey.
The angry residents of the district attacked the board of directors of Solihull, saying that it was "unable to solve the problem '.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said, "They took the place Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at other people.
The Management Board should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to a different location and now they're back.
More arrived last night, and more will probably arrive today. '
She added that: "The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't intend to pay my taxes until the board deals with tourists. '
Another anonymous resident said, "This is ridiculous. Just recently, we watched the last departing tourists and now they're back.
And this time, there's more, and this time, they brought their horses with them. '
The spokesperson for the Solihull Board of Directors said: "We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem successfully.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any dissociative or unlawful conduct to the number 101 police.
This will give us the overall picture that we will present in court. '
The European Member's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special delivered the wounded Róbert Žitňansky to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight was without complications.
According to information, Robert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After transport to the country he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanski by NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.

The Italians are harden in the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board.
Italy has announced that it will prevent NGO rescue ships arriving on the coast of Italy with Mediterranean immigrants unless NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Home Secretary Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin Daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship from the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet due to a suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which significantly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization refused to comment on the whole thing on the charge of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us, the number one priority will always be saving people's lives. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at the moment," said the organization in the declaration on social networks.
"We can only comment on all the current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa ship by Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the ship that were handed over directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the plaintiff's file, only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in rescue operations have yet agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
On Thursday, the latter said that the new rules were not necessary, but acceptable, as they did not constitute any "substantial change or obstacle 'with regard to rescue operations.
The adoption of the new Code of Conduct was rejected, for example, by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
Meanwhile, Minniti has been told that the sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks who have landed in Italy in rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
"In recent days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations to take place this month with Libya's mayors on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of achieving Europe.
Shameless Mesarosova: She had silicone and cellulite coming out of her oval!
Hot summer days are all about taking on the most necessary things to cover up the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaroš does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, just crawling, covered their bodies in mini-overalls.
And all it took was a few normal moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her ass.
Because he'd cut himself in between her cheeks so many times, he'd caved her so high, she'd have to fix it all the time.
The attention of the masters and the photographers present, she certainly had no need.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages inciting Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to prison for two years for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said in court on Thursday, "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was facing up to 20 years in jail, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood in the scene with tears in her eyes, clenched with hands and eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility, "she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's attorney said that it was "unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental illness do not have a significant impact on her actions."
The plaintiff read Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statement, "It won't take a day not to mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters, and together we will endure the great pain that we will carry with us forever, "said the statement.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and never be an aunt to his children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I will carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that affects a person helping to kill another person, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after the text messages by Carter, which incited suicide, were published.
"Hang yourself, jump off the building or stab yourself, I don't care," it was written in text messages that Carter sent just two weeks before he died while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from making any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who took Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007, who was acquitted two years ago.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Audi modifies up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just the day before the Audi notification, the BMW car manufacturer stated that it would offer its customers an update of the software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The BMW President said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of the BMW - which consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would adapt three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted to a large extent the use of diesel atuoms in Europe and the United States in order to comply with the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide which emits diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and may cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of installing equipment to neutralise diesel engine gases, making it difficult for cars to be competitive.
While German car manufacturers face careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its vehicles, which reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions, the software has been deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been indicted in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, a former head of thermodynamics was arrested by an engine development department in the Audi.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and therefore does not apply to him extradition, so he can face the trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, the Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into the Volkswagen car company by the German police after the authorities accused the Audi of installing a system to circumvent the European emission limits - thus widening the accusations faced by the Audi in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can have an unfortunate impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane crash landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident took place on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, approximately 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the SIC Noticias TV channel said that the plane was flying just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people on the beach supposedly ran from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl died on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the scene," described local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people aboard the plane, both of them getting out of the accident alive, and the cops took them for questioning.
D11 or how to not build a highway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even possible to complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unaccounted for, even though it started to build back in 1978.
Even if it's not enough, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the castle highway D11.
The children of the Earth restopped the construction of another section for at least a few months.
We easterners get highways in pieces, like when they cut salami.
The wheel will be cut, and then we'll see when and if we get any more.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless flows of trucks go right through the cities of Jaroměří or Nákoda, which is not a reasonable way to go around.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was launched in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a peep since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradec Králové recently began to be built, and on other sections to Jaroměř, the archaeological survey began with the construction of the construction at the end of this year, you could hear loud banging of the plugs in Eastern Bohemia.
I mean, nobody believed it anymore.
Last week, it turned out there wasn't going to be a building this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Earth-Club Children's Movement for Sustainable Transport from Brno has submitted decomposition.
The children of Earth are repeating their strategy from D1.
They attacked the decision on the building permit in its entirety.
They request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned in the decomposition.
For example, the Hradec Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So far, we're coming down from D11 near the village with the eloquent name "Funeral House."
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and all of a sudden, we're on the side road, and we prefer to get into a motorcade.
The worst part is, you see stories like this all over the Republic.
Scary, constantly blocked road to Benesov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do the Earth Children require?
What is the nature of the problems of the construction of roads in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually impenetrable in the current system?

Provence lavender threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the South East of France, but they are now threatened by climate change.
The lavender declines due to dry climate and harmful insects, causing horror to the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
It is also the cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate. "
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil they make is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, smaller. '
A more efficient distribution of water and slowing of evaporation of water from the soil may be a possible solution, but also a spray of lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and the breeding of several species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoka weekly staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the riots taking place in the Sinaloa area involving organised criminals, corrupt officials and constant drug wars.
Today, however, it meets under the strain of recent events mainly for its own safety.
They learn it's important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked by a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to name every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and premonition.
Picking them out of what - drug traffickers, politicians, traders, and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job is to cover crime.
Violence does not stop, and the bodies are piling up across the country; journalists are constantly increasing among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pen Niet came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them was the co-founder of the Riodioce Periodic, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence linked to drug trafficking.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice," on which he points the middle finger, hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - aged over 30 years, have a shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the establishment in 2010 of a special federal prosecutor to deal with journalists' cases, she has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, and journalists' killers are so rarely brought to trial.
The journalists of Riodoka insist on informing about the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; even though they are destroyed by grief, the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about murderers and a vision of justice, the safety meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoce, Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently due to the title of the article - which can be translated as the 12th River.
The shooters then boarded his vehicle and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown-up kids.
Rumors seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
But in Valdez's case, silence is suspicious.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January edition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest fighting grounds, as rival factions are trying to fill an empty space.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoleum for drug kings, many of whom are bigger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "ceasefire" is thought to be that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of America with drugs.
In spite of the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, continues to rely on the fact that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damascus Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels who waged war with Joaquin Guzman's sons.
The peace could upset the sons; suspected gang members bought all copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counter.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper in which the same story was published.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In Noroeste's periodical he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and set up along with five fellow Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without mentioning the drug trade," said Boboorquez.
Over time, the Riodoce has gained a reputation for brave and true reporting; the newspapers have begun to thrive.
Journalists liked to embark on the search for problem topics and publish texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for a story about Latin America.
The same year Valdez won the International Freedom of Press of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was scared.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when accepting the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "way of life," said Valdez in October last year in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What were you doing in the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
A man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo's bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like you getting involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, said that "sense of smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then there was this thing with Javier."
According to him, as well as others, the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where the employees of Riodoka meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief from 40 degrees of heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the State to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the town district of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of the fact that these police officers are not one of the 50 percent of the law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists have gone to mountainous areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first is the murder of a former boxer's brother Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloa.
They are also blessed with suspicious government spending that took place in the governor's hometown.
There have also been several abductions recently in one of the most luxurious Culiacán restaurants, just a block from the D.A. 's office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were on the lookout when they were about to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who controls all levels of the political scene almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of the sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán escaped the military task force.
A month ago, readers would have read about this in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information on abductions.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal (46), whom he calls "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out to demonstrate in front of the D.A. 's office the following morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western state of Michoacan.
Only a burned body has been discovered, and the authorities say it's based on the DNA analysis of Adameus.
Journalists' activity is escalating across the country, many of them organizing protests and scribbling on pavement and buildings called "SOS printing."
The director of the Boboorquez newspaper is on a visit to Washington, Washington, where he's trying to get international support and get justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa, which took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of following journalists and killing them for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organised crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the orders of politicians and security forces working with organised crime.
The media supervisory group, Articulo 19, has accused more than half of all attacks on journalists by police officers and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders work.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel, "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
There was a keyboard and headphones next to the severed head.
Some branches have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper based at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of the rapporteur, Miroslava Breach.
The others are still going on, just like they did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez approached the public drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly stalking you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruze.
For those who choose not to give up their work, every day represents a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight, and the employees of the Riodoce are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - sipping beer when suddenly the phone rings.
They're hearing that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the website of Riodoce.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shooting.
Boboorquez is throwing a glimpse at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodicals - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for all of Sinaloa - all of the employees of Riodoka follow his steps.
"How could we even think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her on the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first discovery of an amazing creature the size of a rhino whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called the "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs" - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the red-brown colour of its scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a "troubled past."
The article in Current Biology stated that it was "the most preserved yet found armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world."
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved state literally shocked researchers who described him as "truly remarkable."
According to the National Geographic, the armored whitelighter is still the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossils on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada, is behind the discovery.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a giant piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
When the work is done, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
"All you have to do is turn a blind eye and believe that he's asleep, 'said Caleb Brown, head of work, and naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
"He will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaur - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
The study of his skin researchers found that this herbivore - even though it was covered with armor and resembled a walking tank - was most likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
A heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system that uses many of today's animals.
Experts say that it allowed him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in the paper in May. Currently available for consultation at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers named him Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the technician at the Mark Mitchell Museum, who spent over 7,000 hours with the team, carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the wonderfully preserved state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered the cloaking method that today's animals normally use in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part.
Although this cloaking effect is common in nature, researchers' findings are surprising, because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution chose camouflage over confrontation to survive.
Many modern animals with camouflage - for example, deer, zebra or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
"Predation of a giant and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the Cretaceous period, 'said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was probably red-brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and seek further knowledge of his life, including the well-preserved contents of his stomach, to track down his last meal.
They believe the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta area at that time, the climate was the same as in Florida today, and the rivers and oceans went far further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size, 'said Brown.
"For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to turn a blind eye and it seems like he's just sleeping. '
During the Cretaceous period, giant teropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, walked the Earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopeltao, this armored dinosaur may have been a favourite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 11,5-metre-long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossils on March 21, 2011, is behind the discovery, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from snout to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He had two 50 cm spikes sticking out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivore roamed the territory of Canada today until he ended up in the river that washed him out into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote wrote for National Geographic, "finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking he finds.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the scales on his foot. '
How did one activist know the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native from St. Louis sat on a bed in Airbnb's room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across some high school student's contribution.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," stood in it.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @ TheePharoah constantly retweeted her posts on the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter his posts on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old male shot by a white male cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body lying insolently on the street where no one took him even after four hours.
"That's crazy," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put the phone away to go back to him the night she watched tweets about the people who were gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign with the word "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son" in his hand!
She was watching live news - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and at the other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she said, held a gun in his hand, pointing at the crowd, screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
"This isn't the kind of murder we used to call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After she landed at 11: 00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document "Whose Streets?" which will be launched into the cinema on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and indignation, told from the perspective of people living in the community, who go out on the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headband - on a topic that had been discussed many times before - "about experience with black people."
"Remember when I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" remembers the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"There was no way I wouldn't take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"Today's events are the culmination... of the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time it had to know the difference between different layers of experience with black people and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is no different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I could protect her from this experience, I would only harm her. "
On arrival in Ferguson, South Florissant Road was the first stop across the street from the police department, which became the base of the activists who were expecting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for the others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped deliver it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9," said Ferrell, and added that she was President of Minority Student Nurses Ass., and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities when studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
"I had no experience with organization.
It was natural. "
A few weeks later, Ferrell met a later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a document or trying to find a story that can be used?"
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As the Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the topic of death row prisoners.
His participation in the project was also inspired by Ferrell, along with six other locals, who were followed by the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"In this document no one speaks for us, but it is our testimony," said Davis.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about the Savior leader, but about the community's rapprochement," said Folayan - it proved that she is the most open to participation in filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment when she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I have to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of Black Lives Matter.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of a teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under # BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leading positions are ultimately behind the movement," said Ferrell, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the burden of these events. "
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a great many eccentric black women."
However, he insists that "this is not just an aphromatic matter," and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her views.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she was the one who found herself in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy surge in front of the screen. "
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television station cameras have cleared their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving two and a half years probation for blocking the highway in demonstrations.
She described the social political atmosphere in an area she calls home as "disorder."
Yet she hasn't stopped her efforts, which she committed herself to since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose is our chains. "
There was a fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, helped out the helicopter.
Near Český Brod in Cologne, between the municipalities of Bylana and Liblice, there was a fire from 14: 00 field with an area of approximately 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 3: 15, the fire department declared a third-degree fire alarm out of four possible.
According to the fire department's spokesman, Ladislav Holomčík helped put out the fire from the air and the helicopter.
At 6: 00 p.m., the fire was extinguished, the fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
Tens of professional and volunteer fire fighters fought the flames on the ground.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the combine engine compartment.
There was also a helicopter that helped put out the fire, which carried out six drops of water in total.
"We gave the owner the location of the hit, until 8: 00 tomorrow, a volunteer fire brigade will be watching him," said Holomčík today.
And Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and dark - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each one of them seems to have fallen out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorised disclosure of classified wikiLeaks cables.
The new exhibition, launched on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines her experience with technology, informatics and art, and Manning - a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he left the presidency of the United States.
An algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, produced a Dewey-Hagborg razor-sharp, if not an intellectual comment about DNA compliance - as well as the many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken since she was a young woman. She was sentenced in 2013 by 20 indictments, including violation of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photos were held by prison employees. Only one black and white photograph of a lower quality was leaked to the public, on which Manning, visibly concerned, is sitting in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, there were still positive responses to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and gum - to create a picture of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were preparing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait," explained Dewey-Hagborg at the opening of the new exhibition.
But neither visitors nor photography were allowed, so they contacted Chelsea asking if she was interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her trapped muse became friends in two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea had been pardoned and could have participated in the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama applied for Manning's release a few days after the release of the comic book, which was a welcome change after several insufferable years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people who are seeking to release government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incite resentment in areas that he should support with his tweets.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything is happening for a reason."
Under a statement by an artist on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the last name is dotted with the heart) after the end of "self-fractionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centipede letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By placing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to a sophisticated scientific dictionary artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"I hope that people will take it away from us, that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is a single page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning as she emerges in the form of King Kong from United States Disabled Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never let yourself be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not visited the exhibition personally - which was predicted in a comic book - but when she does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genome images, lined up as a mob of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including an almost 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which its genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"In the past they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to feel the crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg about portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor of Northwest University and an employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
In these days, a nationwide search is under way for a professor of Northwest University, and Oxford University employees who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment have been reported by the police.
On Monday, a first-degree arrest warrant was issued for a man named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, stating Cook County's court file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago PD said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
The police were alerted by phone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments they found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau has been declared dead on the scene, and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while the police are looking for both suspects, reporting to the authorities.
Latham worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of the Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Latham is now on administrative leave and has been banned from the university's school premises.
"The entire matter is now under investigation by the competent authorities and the University of the Northwest is fully cooperating with them," said Cubbage.
Warren is the executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
The university spokesman and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are also ready to assist the American police."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked at the whole thing and wish to turn himself in to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations with the Chicago Police Department, has stated that he calls on suspects to surrender themselves to the authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is escalating," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are helping police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
He added that Lath and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza management has issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working on a time list and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
Deputy Prime Minister Vitala Mutko said that it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the reprovisions of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the Code does not contain anything that concerns Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly, "he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which Richard McLaren investigated, of the government's alleged sponsorship of doping by Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said, "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot therefore confess to something that never existed. "
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview for Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: "On many occasions, we have said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservation, "Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected Rusada of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to Moscow's headquarters in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli stated that Rusada was "on the right track" to restore its validity.
The police have accused three people, one is juvenile.
Police have accused three men of setting Wednesday's fire to a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech on Frýdecko-Place.
One defendant is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationalities.
They're facing up to 15 years in prison for a general threat.
This is what the Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kuzel told the press today.
According to him, it was an intentional crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," said Kujel.
He said the police would discuss the possible arrest of the accused.
Further information according to the Director shall not be made public.
"I cannot say more yet, because there are indeed criminal police and investigation officers working on the matter and the prosecutor who oversees the case," said Kuhali.
The wooden church of God's body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will be estimated at tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, a rebuilding of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the other costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabo also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by a glitch in the wiring.
The exact copy was then created in his place.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for associations available for State defence, voluntary shooting training or a team of training trainers, he is counting on the substantive intention of the Act on the preparedness of citizens to defend the state.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been given the task of processing it from the Government, promises to improve the physical fitness of the Czechs and their capabilities, which could then be used by the State in crisis situations.
It follows from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the industry.
The basic objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech people to defend the state, outside the exercise of a military obligation and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the State would support, financially or materially, associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists, and would enable their members to increase their capabilities.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing, if necessary, to come to the aid of the country in times of crisis and on their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or training.
It also involves organizing meetings with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One of the possible options foresees the creation of a new office in charge of administration and project coordination.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the State would use their capabilities only after declaring a state of danger.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wiping of previously obvious borders between different types of threats," it is stated in the intention to refer to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that, therefore, we need to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the project is to create a very broad base which will enable every citizen to respond with expertise to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself or, where appropriate, to protect others, and to avoid making it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to carry out their tasks," states the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their level will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre was set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to extend the scope of regional military headquarters to employ 42 additional soldiers together.
Ministerial officials have previously stated that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of a European Union directive on arms possession.
It would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons the directive prohibits.
Startups that help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Erretto wanted to measure the satisfaction of her e-commerce startup employees, but she didn't find the appropriate research.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And even though she promised anonymity to the survey, some employees expressed their mistrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Erretto, the owner of the hair care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New human-resource startups are constantly emerging in the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific purpose of measuring employees' obligations, startups allow companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer the complete anonymity of employees and the hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass their superiors and contact the directors directly.
"There are tools on the market such as Meal and Fitbit, which monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint startup based in Reedwood City.
Erretto said that Glint made her more aware of what her employees thought and felt in three years.
In addition to rapid surveys and the voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company thermal map and a brief overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - enabling the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is wobbling in scandals after a former employee has published a post on his blog describing the corporate environment and harassing employees who dare speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the "Let's Talk Payments" website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and complexity sector by 2020 can exceed $11.8 billion.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 Convergent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently accepted Uber under his wing as well.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "flash" surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has authorised regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Convercent startup.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behaviour - and if regulators do not act - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotting, employee exhaustion or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25 000 people across 500 locations, uses Convercent for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problems, he had to trace the phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, formally lodge a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general manager of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no reliable way of monitoring employees' complaints before.
Now that the company is using Convercent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been reached before by managers sitting in offices, miles away from the real solution to complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment, is ensured.
"It is approaching a holistic, overall view of employees' experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
The companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed after Enron's fall on the abuse of employees' ethical rights, said Quinlan.
But only when "the social media lit up the whole thing," companies began to realize that they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold capital investors who supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent withdrew $10 million in total from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and eventually took out $47 million of capital.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and received $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high pay and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are accepted and appreciated and that they spend their time on a society that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, striving for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits of LinkedIn, who uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if companies and companies thrive, if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool emerges in the market to ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to society, it is no wonder that there are many investors who will support this effort.
According to working culture experts, it is important to have data on the satisfaction of employees.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that when a company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if change does not happen quickly - in the worst case scenario at all - it can cause disappointment and lack of interest for employees.
"Once you have asked for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of advice at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that relied too much on the data itself.
"Because once you don't finish things, the employees start asking themselves," Did they hear me?
Do they care about me?
And if not, why should I care? '""
Madison Reed, which now regularly carries out a survey of employees every month, can solve the problem by one day thanks to Glint, said Erretto.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and communication quality, Erretto was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start training communication to successfully resolve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday receives a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in a field known to be a frequent redundancy in the long term.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not trust you," said Vitrano.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt. "
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38,3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín.
He thus surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The workers of the Czech hydrometeorological institute informed about this.
But there weren't a lot of heat records against Tuesday on Thursday.
Vedra hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records of 35 out of 145 weather stations over 30 years were broken or even.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded the record.
For example, today's temperature in Strážnice was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclav today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records came from 2013, just like the Keeper's.
Today, high temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Strážnice was the biggest heat in Dyjákovice in Znojemska and Broda nad Dyjí in Břeclav, where mercury was soared to 37.8 degrees, but the record failed.
On the other hand, in Western and Northwest Bohemia, for example, the highest temperatures have been only around 22 degrees Celsius, according to the ČHMÚ website.
"The temperatures didn't start there until later in the afternoon," said the meteorologists.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade according to the ČHMÚ and more heavy rain could come on Sunday.
In most places, however, the temperatures will remain high on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We've got a bit of a mess going on here.
Billions aren't enough for the same vote in the election as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not all of them are as rude as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues in the water Martin Burda and Antonín Frich, is sponsoring the Roby Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehran, who is also chairman of his party.
The convicted corrupt and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta has acquired a Party of Private Members.
The political movement of Agrofert, as Andrei Babiš's project has inadvertently named Kromeriz Mayor Jaroslav the German, is a chapter for himself.
The Mayors caught their billionaire recently, too.
It's Dalibor Dadek, owner of the Jablotron security company.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The entree in the mayor's jersey didn't work out so well for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win 20% in the election.
Some people laughed.
But Grandpa's overstatement is rather distinctive.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinion.
Although he intends to apply for voters' votes in the Mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babiš.
Grampa supported Babiš in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule the popular rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But he's certainly not going into politics because he wants to make himself better.
For me, Babish will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world of control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new boost, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn to imagine possible cooperation with Babish.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa doesn't change his mind and stand up for himself no matter what jersey he's wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babish is sending his "B" to the Mayor's office to build someone this clumsy.
Others may be asking if the head of the Jablotron, perhaps, has broken up with the head of Agrofert in a bad business and is looking for another way to defend himself to his business rival.
But Grandpa's first public performance wasn't just about Babish.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayor for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to stop saying that.
After all, Zdeněk Bakala, a convicted crook before the 2010 elections, was throwing millions on all sides.
The political division of the security agency Vita Bárta, TOP 09 and the civil democrats came together for nearly 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
With Grandpa entering politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then you wouldn't have to ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation for us.
His first days in politics then Grampa crowned by a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with college education come to us at about 50 grand a month.
The ones with the base on less than 20.
A man with 50,000 is rich in local conditions.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grampa's vision of society, the poor pay tax fairly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of a welfare state that they are not very involved in.
The rich simply need to be helped not to work for poverty with poverty.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babish will wash his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires aren't nice people.
It leaves a question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not take their members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the state for their employees and the country for their property.
And in the end, those who want to live well in a rich country to all people, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's Paradise.
The villa complex must have discounted $234 million.
It's not easy selling real estate sometimes.
And sometimes 11 bedrooms won't help him, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the real estate is being sold by President Donald Trump.
At the sale of Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible £8 million.
He informed the Mirror.co.uk. website about it.
The brochure says, "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the connection between a real estate company and the US president did not justify an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to lower the cost of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible £8 million.
The original property price was £21.5 million, the final price fell to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The magnificent 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the property.
The terrace has a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers has been shown to be significant.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of the property on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property was to be bought for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with a new prize, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to stop two training sessions a day. For the Bruins, long days are coming.
The 11th of the morning is approaching, and American football players at UCLA are squeezed at the side line of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and expose their sweaty back, the unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members these few minutes of doing nothing replaces lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will leave for their rooms after three hours of training to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place the next morning at 6: 30.
"These guys are gonna have a lot of work to do for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday swung on Tuesday.
By taking out two training sessions on one day, the NCAA wants to relieve players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exam ends.
This is why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19: 15 - to fit into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins one week earlier than last year and the training sessions are limited during the summer semester.
Eighteen trainings are planned until 20 August, after which formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A & M team will begin in September.
Mora let himself hear that he supports the NCAA decision, even though he added another item to the already charged player's diary.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it's very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But nobody gave up, everybody's trying.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down. "
UCLA will be closed after the training camp is completed, which will not be easy when looking at clear lines of surrounding land from adjacent parking lot and luxury Hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal bar.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there might be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by the security service," said Mora.
"Safety is taken care of, but there's no way anyone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
That's the kind of material that's good for business.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security as well as parking lot number 8.
We will use our resources to the fullest.
I believe everything will be all right.
Everything is planned. "
Facebook plans a more thorough fact check to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to third parties and display findings under original contributions in an effort to combat the so-called "fake news," reported the largest social network on Thursday.
The company says in the declaration on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoax, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook was referred to as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election of the President of the United States.
There are political debates in Europe, and French voters are being swamped with false reports of May's presidential elections, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not quickly remove the angry contributions.
On Thursday, Facebook stated in its next statement in Germany that it was going to launch testing for a new false message control function in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying messages verified by third parties, people ask for more content to be better informed and to make the right choice about what they can share," said Sara Su, the product manager of Facebook's news.
It added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles' function and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of false messages.
Graphic novel creation: story about A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of Squeeze and its refuge was also found by Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney witnessed 700 years of stormy history from his cosy place near the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, which inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County - a famous predilection for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"Looking at the handwriting of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter, I feel a personal connection."
The Graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who have lived in the castle of Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Eduardo period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not, however, the first book of Rhodes inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days, you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives! "
For someone who is so fascinated with old papers, there is support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of living almost four months in the castle almost like a dream. ("To tell you the truth, I have extended my stay a little longer.")
Rhodes spent his time studying the Victorian "new" castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyena on the wall and bottles that have been dumped in a ditch for centuries.
He walked the grounds and examined the ruins of the old castle, spoke to gamekeepers, gardeners, and sometimes also to artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
He was drinking whiskey and writing at night.
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as National Trust gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff only began to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words like "aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands at the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing the property: "You may think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I did come across one case where two families were struggling over the birch.
Stop it, people! "
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and dig deeper into English history, including the story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of a revolt in 1380 castle called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
"The English uprising actually began in this area and I thought that mutiny was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected after all. "
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the coffin was unveiled).
Rhodes' favorite family is Darrell: "I was intrigued by the male race - then men were always in debt and spent money on things they could not afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying rich or old women - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to confuse the heads of the heiress. "
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is searching for other adventures.
Recently he returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he sucked inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was consumed by nature.
It's a strange place for Scotney, though.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought," Now I'm going to get the hell back into real life. "
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump on the new US immigration plan, which will also bring about a change in the award of the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50 000 on an annual basis as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will give priority to English-speaking applicants who have financial resources and will demonstrate skills that will benefit our country, "said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, there would be an online report on the technological development of sexual robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
In the words of a former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look seriously at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of nipples and the appearance of the robot nails.
"People make fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often," said Sharkey on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pan to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course, artificial intelligence imitates human behavior.
The user can "modify" the robot in his image - from the colour of the eyes and the shape of nipples to the appearance and colour of the nails.
But it is very disturbing that many robots have their own "personality," which would shame even the Stepford missus.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character features for his surrogate, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robotic woman, Roxxxy Gold, of the True Company, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" nature.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible," it is written on the True Company website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, talkative, or "in the mood."
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for a number of reasons - which are not a mix-up for real interpersonal relationships. Worried are rather inferior female character features and violent innuendo - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Company on its website resembles Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why shouldn't a man have a Roxxxy?" it says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their creation and almost perfect sophisticated nature point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or gender equality towards a desire for captivating sex with an optional mark-up.
Of course, most men do not buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots remain at the expense of the general public.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set up by modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they have a free market for it.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are taking advantage of their rights and there is a president sitting in the White House who is often very deplorable at the address of a woman.
The most horrifying aspect of the story of the servant is not what we see - hanging bodies and gouged eyes, as is the reality of these visions.
The story of the servant represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots are supposed to be as close as possible to real women (though with porn stars).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to the touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no work, no history, nothing to encourage their independence or to disrupt their commitment to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
21st century speech: maids.
The star of the NBA on the green side.
Curry's fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not get lost in the first shot of the opening night between professional golfers.
The two-time winner of the award for the most useful NBA player played at the Ellie Mae Classic Junior Web.com Tour in Hayward, California's first round of 74 shots and will fight for a cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won the second title in the NBA with the Warriors team this season, started off very nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate between the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four shots above par.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first hit, but then it sat a little bit," Curry said, "he said," There's a lot of fright on him. "
It was very nervous to blow up the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you had told me that I would have played 74 in the first round, I would have taken it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight through a cut that is likely to be set two shots below par, he will become the first representative of another sport to prove it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the fright, I can do that," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in the past in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a PGA tournament.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he got a sponsorship exemption and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense.
Trump's era has become an unmistakable sign of political disagreements that divide American voters and tear apart entire families on a micro-scale.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for him to let us off our nerves.
But less attention is given to Trump's ability to bring the family together.
I'm talking about this because I got a visit from my cousin in New York this week - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that closeness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings she's been bickering about politics for years - is on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it is a good thing, but I am struck by the fact that, in the wider context, it represents a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the appalling possibility that his charms may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even scarier long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to its standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we had an awareness of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, the subsequent Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with glaminate - clowns and animals are filmed and in horror they look at their own shoulders - a completely bleak view and clingy music oddly resembles public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired of: view from high-rise buildings, panorama takes a look, instead of breathing the atmosphere on you and the reality of the city is not getting your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but London Metro Station.
However, a carousel in Central Park is a remarkable magical experience, to the point where two two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, have a great time on it.
If I could rate the carousel, he would have earned the maximum points, but luckily, no one asks.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in a store when I was asked to review my "experience" on a scale of one to five.
It's the same at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, except I can throw in a 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down a different fast sale, but the waitress is forced to push herself into the favor of shoppers when it's not necessary.
The woman at the store was smiling at me when I was unwilling to rate my credit card delivery with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for lacerations on his wrists, which, according to the prison report, was self-inflicted after a fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed his friend Steenkamp in the early hours of the morning on Valentine's Day of 2013 with a few gunshot wounds through the door of his bathroom closet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he mistook her for a thief.
The plaintiffs have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius, which they say is too mild.
National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is in danger of extending his sentence to up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a captive cub, a breeding panda, who was mated in the wilderness.
It's a huge success for a panda rescue program.
The Centre is trying to expand the gene pool of captive pandas.
A Zhang Zhong Center worker told New China that panda breeding was at high risk from kinship.
Only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
In the wild, only 2,000 more survive.
The attempt to mate the captured pandas with the wild is so the first step in keeping the panda to help protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cao-cao was released into the natural reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen man Cao-cao 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the panda male lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
The males misestimate the time when the female is ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, it weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulharans were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the expression quoted by the CTVs.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarian people, were detained on August 1st by the Sithonian police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for the CTVs that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place all season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
The golfer Clara Spilková figures after the first round of Major British Open in a split 50th place.
The field in Kingsbarns, Scotland, was about to score one blow under par when she played three birdies and two bogey.
A 22-year-old Czech player therefore has the hope of passing through the cutout for the first time on a famous major.
The entry into the $3.25 million grant competition came out best for American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the 64-shot field record, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Netherlands Food Safety Authority of the NVWA announced that it was investigating 20 per cent of all Dutch poultry farms, which, according to the Netherlands, means that 80 per cent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk represented only a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a risk to adults, but the potential threat is to children.
Spokesman of the Czech SVS Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also joined the closing of breeding, have not recently been imported into the Czech Republic.
However, the veterinarian shall take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the problem marks of insecticide appeared.
The eggs from Belgium were, according to the veterinary administration, on the Czech market for the last time in April and the eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of anti-flea, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organisation considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, says the goalie Sedláček, and she's looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," laughed 27-year-old peasant, who could start the season in a Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets engaged by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I had to think of it as school, it would be three.
I didn't catch much for my first year, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I was learning.
The second year, I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie that I took turns with again.
Last year, I assumed I'd be caught all the time.
But during the initial ten games, we only scored, like, five points, so the coaches started shooting it.
At the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to pick it up for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is the KHL for goaltenders?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who have to change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is the Russians want to play in the empty.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There's more shooting in the Czech Republic after all.
Did you have trouble traveling and moving through seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done by playing, like, four games outside, and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvian people even feel about their club at the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball, it's a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even though it wasn't going well, there were a lot of people coming.
Did Dinam's work in the KHL help to bring Latvia almost to the quarter finals at this year's World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results began to go up at the World Cup.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarter finals with Canada just 1: 2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to Czech extreme.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts made his way, and before signing the contract, there's Ralfs Freibergs.
How come so many people come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvian are among them.
It's a natural course.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of engagement?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wasn't going to continue in Riga.
That's why we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for a goalie, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the finals, they decided to go with someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín, waiting for something to show up.
Are you nervous about this?
That's when I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after a while.
I caught something at the KHL, so I'm taking it another way.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How real is the option of starting a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what comes out.
Now all I can do is wait and see what the agent has to say.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season wasn't enough for me to choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government fling at Flight continues.
In January of this year I wrote about camp in Letech near Orlík, among other things.
The nature of the problem remains the same, so I will take the liberty of reminding myself of the article's core passages.
They've been talking about camp in Letech for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it is probably best to look for example at the official site of the cultural monument Pieta Place Lety.
There in the beginning of the historical overview they will learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8. 8. 1940 it served as a work camp, from 1. 1. 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2. 8. 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no doubt that these events need to be remembered all the time.
Nor is there any doubt that this reminder should take place at the memorial in the place of these people's suffering.
The problem is elsewhere.
In socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s it was built in the vicinity and parts of the former camp by a pig.
The history of the camp was randomly discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was discovered in Letech.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish a pig, but so far it has not.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close the swine.
So very briefly, the facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
It was only last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pigs.
According to the Minister of Culture of Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, and others say the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, there's no way this is gonna be cheap.
Yet only a few hundred metres from the former camp is a monument, which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the United Nations Committee on Human Rights financed the transaction beautifully, which is not likely to happen, I think it would be just as much a waste of money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified piety place, stands at the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place, and anyone who wants to do so can bow to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let us leave it as it is, and keep the piety place with maximum care.
The person responsible, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should treat the entrusted property, including taxpayers' money, with the care of the proper economy.
At least with one like it in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above, I see the motto of the leader of the YES movement merely as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May, I went straight to the spot.
Very decent driveway, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exposure, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with a seating area and a view of its own piety place, which is made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place, as it is appropriate and proper.
Archaeological research is currently taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the exposed bases could be preserved and at least visually made available in an appropriate way.
In this direction, Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could step up his efforts.
If he manages to enforce the purchase of a pig for government money, it will just be another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the UK is causing abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at Washington University have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to produce immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna's study director explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales are tilted to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, scientists found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to form cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We found a connection between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells. "
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing proved to apply to humans, the combination of L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
The postgraduate researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the course of the study of certain types of immune cells supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of same mice kept separate cells.
It derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbioma - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse intestine was tested using the DNA grading method, and researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing from the second group of mice.
Mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbioma - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - was given L. reuteri bacteria - and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that have been stored in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turns out to be a by-product of tryptophane metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably seek to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population. '
José Mourinho regards the signing of the contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as "brilliant."
Manchester United got a "genius" from his team in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the back-up man debutted against Sampdoria in the Wednesday game.
Matić, who signed a contract for £40 million, presented himself in the first match with a win of 2: 1 in Dublin - the last preseason match before the UEFA Supercup, where the United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed his role as backup alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereir.
However, as he did not take part in the team's presiding Asian tour, Matić had no form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinha said should be worked on before the next season of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent, and has a brilliant mind - thinking football," said Mourinho.
"We're gonna help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukaku have also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his 11th for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club did a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thanks to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins of Ladi Pear.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The many-promising picture began to draw thanks to the new TV show Prima Zdeněk Academy.
The pear immediately breathes a chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he challenged him in the social media video.
And since the two of them have been on top for years, he hasn't forgotten to irritate Ládek this time.
"In return, I can teach you from diet chicken meat, American cucumbers, or invite you out for a drink and show you why fried cheese is a favorite," Pear nosed.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what did the boss say," he said to Lightning.
But he didn't say anything because he was filming new parts of his next show, yes, chef.
Only Prima responded to the participation of Pear in the culinary academy, considering the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes off-TV.
In December 2004, he gave his first cookbook to Prušek Pohlreich.
She sold over 300,000 pieces in a few days!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at the press conference for the autumn broadcast scheme is an unadulterated cooking school.
Pohreich chooses his pupils from among the spectators, and in twelve pieces he introduces them to twelve cooking techniques.
In the last episode of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk had his shirt crossed off.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'll just smile at the pear - the pear is healthy fruit and has plenty of vitamins," said Ládek.
He thinks about Ládek's culinary art.
"To cook according to Lad Pear is not an option even at home, because I will not let the gastrohunk go home," my boss is clear.
I respect Zdenek Pohlreich very much, he even thinks I make honey chicken.
But his recipes will certainly not appear on my show, "he did not forgive Pear.
He's an asshole!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analfabet or asshole," said Pohlreich about Hrušk in a lecture.
"I am not twenty years old to be able to wave my hand at them, but I do not care for them anymore," said Prušek on the account of the insults.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. By simply waving his hand, he can unlock the door to the house and office and even start the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the implantation process and adherence to treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure lasts 30 seconds.
The Northama company also offers a service for changing door and car locks compatible with the microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple wave of a hand.
The White House Props cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the US manufacturing industry that took place last month came to $24,000 according to the Navy records issued by TIME weekly.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the top of the program of July 17 in the White House, which was a show of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials were looking at a product show from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was built next to the Maine yacht, the Wisconsin fire truck, and the Mississippi forklift.
A White House military officer issued a fragmental order, or FRAGO, and applied for the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the landing of a helicopter on South Lawn in an "emergency" event, reported Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for managing the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such an important event," wrote HMX-1 in an e-mail to your superior, Deputy Navy Commander for Aviation the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7: 00 p.m. for the show, which is scheduled to start at 3: 00 p.m. and will remain in place until the entire place was cleared out, which was planned between 6: 00 and 9: 00 p.m.
The e-mail also stated that if there is a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for return flight due to a working time regulation.
The original crew stayed on the scene that evening, along with the helicopter, along with a unit of security personnel.
From the records - which were obtained by TIME weekly - it was not apparent whether the other crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible breach of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine," wrote the commander.
"Sounds like you've been blocked," said the deputy commander.
This "Made in America" parade was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President advocated health reform, which passed through the Senate and talked about trying to keep the government regulations in check.
The use of means of air transport such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them to travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was riding in the background during his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the" Made in America 'show presented by products from all 50 states produced by Americans from American materials, "said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landing in the Washington and South Lawn area and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with the utmost precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the current crew training, stated by the state official.
The helicopter unit flew another 11 hours in the "non-presidential support missions" on the same day.
The White House stated that no further props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky stated that the company was in no way involved in the negotiations on the issue of a helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights, and the exact costs of the show are difficult to identify, according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3D is $24 380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"Putting taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs. '
According to the 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement of DoD expenditure does not include personnel costs but includes fuel costs, maintenance costs and contractual costs.
Then White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for show purposes.
"The idea of the show that is taking place this week is to present the products produced in the USA," said Spicer.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and the other military facilities that countless American citizens are involved in.
This fact is to be recalled. "
It's not clear if Trump was looking at a helicopter while he was on his rounds at South Lawn, but he certainly only sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump approached a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I own three."
A young woman got stuck in the swamp by Máchov Lake, the police were wading towards her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2: 00 in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she stayed trapped in the marsh.
When she decided to ask for the help of a police officer on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, the police soon lost contact with her," said Police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
A couple of police patrols went to the place she described, but it wasn't easy to find a young woman.
"Some of the policemen had to wade through the reeds hundreds of meters before they felt solid ground again," said Baláková.
And so was the missing person.
The police were oriented according to which direction her cry for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed to count her down aloud," said the speaker.
The police found a woman at three quarters to five in the marshes of Borné.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological forces, showing signs of hypothermia.
That's why an ambulance called in moved her to a garlic hospital.
Grandpa's connection to the STAN?
The bride you're asking for is becoming a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With its web project, it's like a billionaire telling voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that a politically unparalleled group of less well-known mayors and independent, actually has no national agenda for the House elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, whatever political opinion she has.
Vít Bart used to start out like this, and it didn't turn out very well.
In addition, with his hunt for decent people and personalities, who may also replace some mayors on the candidates, which Gazdík has also admitted, Grandpa cancels out the popular argument by the head of STAN that the most important value of the movement is the politically proven and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, even according to surveys.
Now, they're willing to replace the unfamiliar persons on short notice.
The total breakup with the folk, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the folk.
But if there were few suspects of identity at the time, then only the identity game ends after Grandpa came.
Not only Gazdík has long been defined against ANO Andrei Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Grandpa, who praises Babiš publicly, stated as follows: "My goal is that the YES movement, namely the Mayor, will win 20% in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babish, but he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been more of a reality show than a real political party for some time now, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to be making the desired bride a sales girl even more.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the folk, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs trained in the Bridge by helicopter
Dogs specializing in explosive search and search dogs rehearsed helicopter flights at Lake Most today.
The police dog must not be shy and be afraid of flying, said the chief police cynologists of the Ústí Region Petr Tomášek.
It takes about two years to train a police dog.
At the Bridge, both adult trained dogs and those who are still training have been trained.
In addition to standard training to detect sharp explosive samples around the lake and look for a missing figure, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter gets there, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter ride.
"The helicopter gets in, the dog goes and immediately seeks," said Tommy.
A dog that is restless or unable to start work on a helicopter journey is eliminated from training.
"They are usually kept by dogs for example in the garden," added Tomášek.
Police have 76 dogs in the Ústí Region with different specialties.
German shepherds prevail, but Belgian shepherds are growing.
The dog guide takes care of him from the puppy.
"Raising him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," added Tommy.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unafraid, it takes the first exam at 20 months.
"He enters a sharp strike about two and a half to three years," added Tommy.
The length of service in the police department depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve in eight to ten years.
They usually live on their dogs.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics.
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, have been listed on Wednesday by a UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Auxiliary Mission, said that hundreds of women participate in local councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he stated in his Wednesday statement.
Elections may be fully representative and credible only if they are attended by women, as well as all related processes related to the elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban have made several threats against the electoral process, which is moving international combat activity to the other side.
For the first time ever in this year's elections, one democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that women's strong role will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission stated that out of 3,6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women are women.
The unique brewery is brewing beer again.
To a good beer for a reresurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to life a few years ago by the brewery in Lobchi near Mzena.
The brewery commemorated for the first time in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a steam engine operation.
Years of flourishing followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The works of destruction were completed by brewery owners after 1989.
The abandoned premises were destroyed and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes of new owners, architects of Jana and Pavel Prouzová rose.
They started repairing buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to the study of archive materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when it started its golden era.
Their work was awarded by the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European industrial heritage paths.
In 2015, they festively restored the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste the great lobbyist beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořín, visit the brewery.
In the brewing of beer, they use Kokořín water flowing in a protected landscape area, malt from the lobech fields and Zátek hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and 1: 30.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
The fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, on the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babi, was to be so unique.
It was originally intended to be composed of up to twelve bunkers connected by large underground.
This was supposed to be the headquarters, barracks, munitions, materials, power plant, machinery room and hospital.
But the construction ended the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, the only massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the Stachelberg Association enthusiasts who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is already 75 percent open!
In addition to the infantry cabin T-S 73 with the exhibition and underground, the complex is equipped with a light fortification object, and two built-in infantry cabins, trenches and an educational trail Fortified Trutnova.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was listed next to monuments such as the Great Wall of China, the Traian Port of Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The monastery Chotosov originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which is today mainly a massive four-wing building of the convention over a beautiful garden.
The list he got into, but unfortunately it belongs to unique structures that are threatened with extinction.
But the enthusiasts don't want to give up, and they're holding a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is another year of the evening for the monastery Chotosov this Saturday, August 5th, where Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Hlas will perform, you will see fencing performances and you will look at places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look the Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Hall of the Moravian Museum in Brno attracts an extraordinary excursion into the deepest primordial to the Stone Age, to the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals were perfectly able to cope with all sorts of extreme climate conditions, especially the alternating of ice and ice times.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful predators of their time.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting skills were, but also their aesthetic sensations.
You wouldn't say that in Neanderthals?
Let me see if I can convince you in Brno.
The 14th KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is held on Saturday, 5th in the castle of Veverí.
In addition to great music you will see the construction of a Celtic village, you will try out Celtic way of life including crafts, games for children and adults, prophecies, magic or ritual body painting.
La Quadrilla will not be missed with Irish and Scottish dances, drummer jamming, bagpipe play and amazing fire surprise by Carpe Nocte.
What does Moravian-Silesia taste like?
The seventh edition of the famous gastronomy festival The Moravian-Silesia festival is held on Saturday, August 5, 2017 in the area of the mountain spa Karlovy Vary.
The chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, you will taste culinary specialities and regional food, enjoy music and dance performances, rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, bouncy castle, Smurf competition path and of course a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
A new free Pl @ ntNet application will help students with the creation of herbarians and ordinary plant lovers.
If they're interested in what plant they just ran into on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they have to do is photograph the plant and the app itself recognizes what kind of plant it is.
The new application available for iOS and Android was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education in Bratislava Mountain Park as part of the City's Secret Life project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools who photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database with teachers.
The newly created French application is free of charge for download on the Secret Life of the City site.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants the application can recognize.
"Children who can hold a tablet or cell phone can go into the woods," said the coordinator of this project Ivana Poláčková.
Based on a sufficiently good photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within seconds, which it then assigns to the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the project The Secret Life of the city.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the application after the account has been opened with a picture of a plant not yet present in the database.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," said Poláčková.
GMBs' concerns about the investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding assurances from the managers of the McVitie's cookie maker about the long-term commitment of production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish GMB trade union has stated that the company is silent for the time being about any investment in the Tollcross plant.
There are more than 500 employees working in the factory who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said that she had invested more than £5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
It added that workers and trade union representatives would be "among the first informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In their letter to the head of the company, the Scottish GMBs expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not receive their promises of financing and modernisation of production lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we did not get a clear answer from the construction manager about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Many generations of families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and Glasgow, where working in the factory here represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
In terms of work, salaries and utility - and despite the view of Brexit, rising life costs and declining slow production - the East of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie's. "
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "Construction manager Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMBs employees and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many problems were discussed openly at this meeting.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and precarious economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested £5 million in Tollcross, particularly in production lines and traffic efficiency.
We very much appreciate the legacy of Tollcross and the location, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
La League may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to be taken on his side after passing £189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona about its record raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has stirred up the waters of summer transfers. The League 1 Club is prepared to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid £89 million for it last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and, at the same time, the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 per week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar got out of his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world brought to the attention of the President of the PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed the notional line by expressing an interest in PSG's backup Marco Verratti in the summer.
The PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances will it allow an Italian representative to leave. It is therefore possible that Barcelona now swallows a bitter pill for its bold behaviour with Neymar's departure.
Who's going to explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broad rules?
Donald Trump has nodded to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat, and that this would not go on.
Even with that, the idea of sanctions is like straw from shoes.
Those things can't be thrown into the same bag.
Maduro's Venezuela has really set off on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is simply not acting as the US President would like.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even a normal voter, American, European or otherwise, understood what he was based on, and on which system of rules the sanctions policy is based, it would be an almost impossible task.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely pursuing what President Obama has already prepared, just giving it an implementing stamp.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won America's election, he would hug Putin and withdraw sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, but they are tightened.
But Europe is even more terrified.
German Secretary Zypries says Trump's sanctions are in violation of international law.
You mean kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are neither kosher nor anti-Russian EU sanctions.
The European Commission's head Juncker, again, complains that Trump's sanctions threaten EU energy security.
You mean to use sanctions just weak enough not to put anyone in danger?
A common voter is dipping.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended solely on the fulfilment of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now known that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voter is thicker and wider.
There are sanctions on Russia for overfitting where it shouldn't.
China is losing weight for not installing enough.
The Venezuelan President is being punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrei Babiš: I do not consider working with Okamura.
Andrei Babiš is married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Besides the Pardubice Region, he's already finished all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not interfere in any significant way.
He even agreed to have the captain and shadow minister of education run the Moravian-Silesian region, YES Ivo Vondrak.
"But if it succeeds, it will have to choose whether it wants to be a Member or a Member," confirmed Babiš's earlier position.
You've upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should manage the municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am in favour of direct democracy, we are voting directly for the President, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
I'm not talking about disturbing the representatives in my book, they might as well be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
When I was presenting your book, what I was dreaming about when I was sleeping, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about canceling the councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct choice and reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor blames herself for not building enough and not preparing big projects, but she doesn't have the authority.
The same is true of a government that has only been run by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it right.
The current Prime Minister is not in control, he's just moderating the debate.
It can't work like that.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
All we have in the program is a one-wheel election to the Senate.
We have also proposed the rolling mandate of ministers and the regulation of the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to present themselves at the meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator, you will run the government, control the House with 101 Members, abolish the regions and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and mayors, rule the country.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There's nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction in the legislature by a third, while there are 57 000 French legislators per legislator, while we have 17 000 Czechs.
But no one is accusing Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic wins majority elections, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making some dramatic changes.
However, for those who have a parliamentary majority, they are great, just look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no such threat in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team to work for the people in the government, not for their partisans or their resorts.
For example, I do not understand why we have failed to agree that only teachers' salaries, staff in culture and social services will increase.
Why did they outvote me and add 21 percent to the members of the GIBS, who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave ineconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency, and would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa for the money of the state.
Ministers aren't supposed to argue in the government, they're supposed to argue outside of it.
There's no room for coalition rioting, power voting, and business, that's where he's supposed to make his decisions.
How are you going to have a coherent team when ministers are mostly partisan?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition treaty was not valid, and he threw Babish out of government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and he has control skills, he doesn't need a false gesture like that.
It measures everyone the same way, and it requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you have any idea who you'd suggest to the Treasury Secretary?
I don't even think about it, because we probably won't even be in that government, and no one wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did that was so terrible.
So much skepticism is not in place.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Grampa, who would like to cooperate with you, perhaps the wing of Jiří Chunk will win for the folk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaoralek, who does not rule out the coalition with YES, and Václav Klaus ml. may be promoted in the ODS, which will also not be against it.
I'd leave it up to the voters.
Vice-Prime Minister and Vice-President Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the Okamurians are eligible as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran as a puppet Vita Bárta for VV, then raised money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a distinct personality.
A little brown, though.
If I take his program, he has a wide-ranging involvement of people in corporate governance, a direct democracy, I can agree with that.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder, is it an acceptable person for you who has xenophobic views, who is speaking at the gallows demonstrations and who wants to leave the EU?
We're not considering working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It's gonna be about negotiating a winner with a second in line, but God knows who's gonna win and who's gonna be number two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government agenda.
Let's get back to your efforts to run the state as a firm.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka was letting everything go to waste, never making a decision.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me, too.
As soon as he did, ČEZ took over the Czech government.
After all, it is incredible that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by ČEZ, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how to vote at the General Assembly of ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the personnel situation in the Supervisory Board and exchange the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm going to be Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
Rumor has it that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with CSSD would like to exchange for even better with YES.
Well, maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I have no lobbyist Pokorné or Růžice, I am a separate unit, and I am not dealing with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become head of government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, i.e. the institutions you criticise?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, it has never driven it, it was only there until the count, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial matter.
ČEZ is supposed to take Dukovans, appreciate them, stick them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purposeful campaign against me, but I don't, and I won't have the authority to fire anyone.
But control is.
I don't want to control anyone.
I am just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion per year for public broadcasting and television, but they do not really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't know?
The House approves the report on their management, which directly affects the positions of directors of ČT and ČRo.
Look how these reports are being discussed, the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary committee to escape from the investigation files and to Lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalouska push me out of the government, which passed the percentage of TOP 09, but the CSPD took them down.
They're afraid of disrupting their corruption system, so they're talking about endangering the democracy of Babish.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first Vice-President, YES Jaroslav Faltýnek, builds a power background by placing his son in the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with urban and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or ČD for his related lawyer, Květoslav Chána?
We have a permanent dispute about that.
I don't like it, and I blamed him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't go that far.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
Unlike the Socans, we've never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochnílova, Březina.
If there was any sign of clientelism in our country, we immediately fired such a person.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If something like this happened, we'd get rid of whoever it was, no matter who it was.
