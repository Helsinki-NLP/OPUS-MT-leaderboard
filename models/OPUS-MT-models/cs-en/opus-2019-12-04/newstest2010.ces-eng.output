Barack Obama will receive the Nobel Peace Prize as America's fourth president
US President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours, to take over the Nobel Peace Prize as America's fourth president in history.
A diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million will be awarded for, among other things, exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief will fly into the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife and will be busy.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time five members of the committee who selected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The presidential couple then has a scheduled meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremonial ceremony at which Obama will receive a prestigious award.
He'll get it as America's fourth president, but only the third one to win the prize right in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war in accepting awards.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, the war effort increased even more by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
At the ceremony Obama will also receive a gold medal, diploma and check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's going to give them to charity, but he hasn't decided on a particular charity yet.
The busy program will then lead the president and his wife to the banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian King and Queen, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will also be present.
Obama was more of a restraint from the beginning to the price.
He said, for example, that he felt he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it was not just a price for him, but for all those who sought the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that he was "a call for action."
Protector of nature accused of extortion
The Litomeric Police have accused the Chairman of the Civil Association of the Society of Nature Protectors Litoměřice of extortion.
In a few cases in the past year, he referred to some construction procedures, asked investors to withdraw the appeal for money for their benefit, said Litomeric police spokesperson Alena Rome.
Lubomír Studníčka is the chairman of the Litoměřice Society of Protectors of Nature.
Now he's in custody, and he's facing up to three years in prison.
The sorting containers of Brno do not smell very good.
In Prague, ordinary people can sort out their beverage wrappers; in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step of the way.
And in Brno?
That's where you can reserve a few minutes before you find a suitable trash can.
I do not want to say that waste would not be sorted at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that for us to be the second largest city in the Republic, the councilmen are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the forest league sorting waste not only because, as citizens, we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers, but mainly the number of garbage cans on such waste.
Have you ever tried to dump a PET bottle in a collection basket downtown?
It's a mess, it takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I've found so far is in Moravian Square across from Potrefé Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but it doesn't seem to be that bad.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort waste that way.
Sloth.
It's a long way to the dumpster.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored garbage cans on Konce Street.
Luckily, I ran into the right place on the way to the shalina.
But the garbage was overflowing from it.
It's still the center of Brno, which the city represents most, isn't it?
But ecology and aesthetics don't seem to be very interested in the socialists of Brno.
They would rather buy the city hockey extraliga, which will embarrass us throughout the country than buy a few extra containers and offer sorting of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad to have been able to confirm my conjecture after a moment of Internet browsing with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has added, despite the government's view, to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sick leave or for building savings.
But also interest on government debt or international litigation.
It will add problems to those who rule in the second half of next year, says the Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists promoted the increase to some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions, or sick money to be borrowed by the government. "It's just putting off problems in the future, setting mines," says Janota.
In fact, the borrowed money pays ever higher interest and has to come back sometime.
The state doesn't have much choice where to take it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
All of whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their kids.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sick leave, whose account lost 1.8 billion, they get them.
But at the cost of more debt being owed to the state, next year it will not be less than 163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, along with interest costs.
The state will need money to pay it, and it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT slightly or reduce the maternity fee, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
For the sake of money transfers in favour of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the completion of motorways and railways.
These are mostly already competitive and built-up sections which are redesigned and possibly not cheaper.
Preserve the most, which is also not free.
This means a delay or a stop to 30 large buildings, the use of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD has proposed that the loss of money will be resolved in Solomon - it will reach into the dividends of ČEZ, which the State has most of its own, and it will spill on the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a bottomless resource.
Last year, €18 billion came into the budget from CEZ.
Every year, dividends pay for the disposal of environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
But this is not the end of the transfer carnival.
Almost three billion have been lost in the budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and crime, or spending on litigation, even on building savings.
If the state can do without this money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll still have to pay for it, Janot says.
The minister will then have to save money inside the department or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing from the already launched two billion-dollar Treasury project, which is intended to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities are spending on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Treasury Secretary hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have had to stop, sanctions would have come, he warns Janot.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
The unveiled plans sound promising.
Just press one key and transfer from Windows Mobile to Android within seconds.
This is precisely what the American VMware company aims to do, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles on your phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, indicated by Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a few days ago it was first presented.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were also running alongside each other.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and should be able to reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains tortures the hotels
The bare slopes are not only worried about Krkonoše skippers.
Missing snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in the Giant Mountains there are still available rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a huge visit to our website.
People are going through offers, they're looking at prices, but so far, they're afraid to make a binding order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be in the snow or in the mud, "said Spindl.Info Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal.
Whoever wants a New Year's Eve stay in Špindlerův Mlýn exactly as he wishes, he should no longer hesitate to order.
Who prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is in second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Meanwhile, the Spindler hotels offer mostly only weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they're gonna try to turn them in for a while, but then they're gonna let them in and go for a shorter period.
And then the spare rooms will be rapidly diminishing, "Janduro estimated.
Free beds in all winter terms still offer Vrchlabská travel agency Ingtours.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas week that hasn't been sold out yet.
Half the seats in our offer are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute, "said Director Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can offer Vrchlabská travel agency also, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fortnight of February, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting if they attack.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will be sold out, "says Schiefert.
On the contrary, a little better than last year, the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Snezkou are occupied.
We're about five percent better off.
We have the last few seats for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
A great interest is in Polish holidays in January and February is also well sold, "said the director of the best hotel in Paris, Karel Rada.
The hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janské Lázně is 80% occupied by New Year's Eve stays.
On the contrary, half of the beds are still available at the most recent Yanskoláske hotel at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which is already occupied by about 60%.
A little weaker is February, but as soon as the snow hits, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly rise, said hotel manager Omnia Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the Krkonoše hoteliers have to let their taste go.
It's supposed to cool down on Thursday, if there's any rainfall, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then again there will be warming, informed Jiří Jakubský from the castle workplace of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
USA: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is funny how Barack Obama, the president with the cleverest reputation, has repeated the strategy of his predecessor, who he himself considered to be the stupidest, on the Afghan question.
When he finally sweaty his desired Afghan doctrine, it turns out he copied it through a copy of Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only is he using "as in Iraq" word turnover several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to even use the title of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the title of his own declaration: "A new way forward."
Three years ago, he himself criticised Bush's idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq, plagued by civil war, as "irresponsible, and in its aftermath, catastrophic decisions."
But the following months have shown that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field leaders, was the only possible and highly successful one so much that news stories about Iraq are not being discussed at all today.
It did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting point than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
He was asked to increase the military contingent once again by field commanders, especially the head of Afghan operations, General Stanley McCristal, who even, despite the subordination practices, severely criticized the hesitant gunmen in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break things for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but it was the best he could do, so at least he cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze the promise of another 5,000 out of Europe, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic thing about the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half-price increases will give the same fruit as Iraq's progress.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements are adhered to.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are poorly prepared to change the master every day according to how convenient it is for them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain but a pohomkin village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balancing of the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely difficult, given the lack of clarity of the circumstances that complicate Pakistan and Iran's influence even more.
Nor does the construction of a "capable state," which is the minimalist objective of the entire operation, seem too realistic.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy captures its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of an explosion.
Believing that soldiers sent into war with the purpose of "early return home" will bring about a miracle, only a soul can truly be romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will see this as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is coming to a close.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war at the foothills of Hindu Kush.
Another factor able to intervene radically in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the intensified sanctions against Iranians do not take effect, there will be a difficult question before the United States whether to try to solve the problem with military force.
It will need to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will move on to the winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any such solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore enough time remains to come up with another strategy if it proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers will no longer receive cash rewards
The senior officials of the Goldman Sachs Bank will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that responded to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will get shares instead of money that can be sold in less than five years.
Moreover, stocks may be taken from managers if they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to go in, stated by the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after spending nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) on rewards for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the company's total remuneration for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measures announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political issue with the arrival of the financial crisis in many countries.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to charge a single 50% tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000 (about CZK 712.000).
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
The record of five women in Stockholm today took over from the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustaf of this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin was Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak for chromosome research.
The award for chemistry was given to Israel by Ada Jonathan, along with the Americans by Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last laureate had the Nobel Prize for Economics, which was awarded to American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for analysing economic governance.
The only professional category without a holder this year was physics.
This award was taken today by scientists Charles Kao for optical fibre research and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each awarded took over the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of profit of the financial reward.
Each category reaches 10 million Swedish crowns (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more honours in each of them, the reward is shared among themselves.
Traditionally America's President Barack Obama received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, as he was only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he was at the forefront of a country that led two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defending his policy, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to win peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering demise. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will adopt the Minister of Finance, Eduardo Janota, who is considering staying in the government, because he does not agree with the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also criticizing the budget.
According to him, it has too high a deficit, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
The president's spokesperson Radim Ochvat informed us about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed to the Left's proposals for transfers of money and increased money for civil servants' salaries, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of social democracy for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
There was a heated internal political dispute between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, which led to a question mark over the further work of Fischer's official cabinet, the formation of which was agreed in the spring by the ODS, the CSPD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially liquidating the austerity package that Fischer's government imposed in the autumn to stop the state from being indebted.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the State Budget Act, has stated at today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have been neglecting the "serious problem" that is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He doesn't think he has a good solution anymore.
Only a strong government that could, moreover, rely on a broader consensus between political parties could bring about improvements, is that of the President.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong statements."
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topolánek government has prepared for this year will exceed CZK 200 billion.
Already on Wednesday, the CSPD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
People's people were also satisfied.
The Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's novel
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie Invictus: The undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, about its struggle and victories, despite some criticisms that American actors play the main role.
The story tells of sport, race, and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless warrior against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that a 91-year-old Mandela asked him if he could be portrayed in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, a 70-year-old actor who won an award for a role in Eastwood's drama from the Box of the Million Dollar Baby has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the anti-slavery movement, who eventually became a slave, a fictional President of the United States, and even a god in God's Evan, but rarely someone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
Former South African statesman has been in prison for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released for freedom in 1990, and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for undefeated and it is the title of the poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can join his people through sport, so he decides to unite the players of the rugby, who are the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was for me to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I find that when I press your hand, I take your energy, it transmits, and I feel like I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon depicts François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
It was a big surprise to him when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened the door, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of actors compared to their actual designs under director Eastwood, Invictus has received: Undefeated positive reviews and there is talk of ambition for Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his reviews in the words, "He was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
Secrets of Shining Over Norway deconstructed: Russians tested the rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
Only yesterday, the Russian Ministry of Defence admitted that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was unsuccessful again, and the missile called "Bulava," which was originally meant to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in missile tests did not have an appropriate effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava mostly didn't take off at all or was damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers have already written about "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This one in the order of the 13th attempt was done normally at first.
The apparatus was damaged again at the end of the flight.
Looks like the engine blew up in the third degree of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" took off from Dmitry Donsky's atomic submarine, which sailed beneath the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows for firing from a vessel that is in motion and immersed at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed broken "Bulava."
After all, from the first moment, the Noros had no doubt that this was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals are defending themselves and say that we cannot speak clearly of failure.
The first two levels of the rocket lasted, and the accident hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first degree.
Even though not a single test start has gone wrong, only six out of 13 consider the Ministry of Defence's leadership to be unsuccessful.
Almost 50% success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism, and so they still claim that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defenseman, Viacheslav Feassov, will again present himself in a professional hockey match at 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup winner will help out his CSKA team Moscow in need and will probably start in Friday's duel of KHL against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at 40 years old in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kulyas got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov's been training regularly and agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formalities, quoted by the AP coach of the Sergei Nemtinov Club in Moscow.
It's not clear yet whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only cover one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of other players, mentioned by Nemtsov.
According to AP, if he returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL he played for Hartford the legendary assailant Gordie Howe in the 1950s and he scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union jersey he won two Olympic gold, seven World Champion titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he collected achievements even in the NHL, where in the Detroit jersey he raised twice above the head of the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has agreed to the union and will cancel all overtime.
The management of Hyundai Nosovic Automotive has agreed to cancel all overtime with the trade unions.
It is because of the often ordered overtime that the unions announced a strike emergency on Monday.
It was confirmed by the spokesperson for Hyundai's car company Petr Vanek.
However, management wants to agree with trade unionists on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign from our production plan, which is essential, which is why it was proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, said Vanek.
Server Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday's shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
That's what people get for working Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way employees motivate for the proposed overtime.
They can either have an overtime surcharge paid, or they can take a spare leave on December 28th, and thus extend their Christmas holidays by a day, said Vanek.
In addition, all the staff on Saturday's shift will receive paid fare and lunch.
Since overtime was the most urgent and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesters, who had stopped production indefinitely last week, yesterday afternoon the management decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vanek said.
Until last week, car workers were forced to work almost every day after an eight-hour shift for another two-hour overtime.
After the agreement is signed, the trade unions will call off the strike emergency.
Further negotiations between the management of the car company and trade unionists are due on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, the head of the trade union Petr Kuchař said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car plant got heated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struck due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management opposed the fact that overtime had to be done by employees to meet the requirements for the delivery of cars.
In their Monday announcement of strike alert, the trade unions also demanded that no sanctions should be imposed on the employees who interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions are demanding the firm to keep the overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5000 crowns for it this year.
Nošovická Automobile Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production last November.
By September this year it produced around 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'hardened' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already acquired immunity against medicines.
This in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on the normal variant of the virus as some medicines already available.
AIDS disease can't be cured yet.
However, a combination of medicines that prevent HIV virus from multiplying in the body may significantly prolong patients' lives.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of virus multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that substances called metalocarbonates act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbonates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new "improved" compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metalocarbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Traitorous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an HIV protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV fission, mature viral particles would not have occurred.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, and scientists explain in the press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically amended.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metalocarbonans on the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as that of clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants that are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modification, makes metalocarbonans interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Řezáčová, head of the laboratory of Structural Biology, Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
An argument over the budget. ODS has gone after Fischer, he's defending himself
The head of the ODS Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "scary," and according to him, Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister referred to the expression of the ODS as a strong statement.
He says he's saving time for analysis.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Netime, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit, or to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, he pointed out Netime.
On Wednesday, the House adopted the budget for 2010, but with the left-wing amendments for more than CZK 12 billion.
The House has raised money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's call for proposals for social democracy was to secretly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage the deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so it granted the Government's wish that the modified budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and vanity
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
The lack of time is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could have looked different.
According to Czech TV, Janota made an appointment for the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget negotiations.
According to the Government, if Fischer speaks out for a further struggle with the budget deficit, they have no business with the CSSD nominees who have implemented the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other laws that raise deficits, such as those relating to sickness, pensions or the amendment to the Staff Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, underlining Topolánek in a text message from the US.
He reminded us that several ministries had people in their positions reporting for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Intime stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of combating the government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct to lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
Then, they say, he cannot count on the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I have not thought about it, and when it is up to date, I will do so, and the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was nominated by the civil democrats, said to the journalists in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer left for Brussels at the European Council meeting this afternoon.
At the Prime Minister's request, the ODS retreated.
At the same time, the lack of time stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House, unless the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats explicitly asked to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, then he responded to the question whether the ODS did not burden the absence of the party president in both Parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly the bolshevision of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD order, fewer trains will travel for almost the same fare.
Czech Railways will cancel or restrict some of the less loaded speedsters and locales from December 13, while other connections will strengthen.
The total volume of transport will be reduced by two percent from the new timetable date compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fare, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will get more connections to the capital, and the tracks will add one pendolino kit to this line.
On the contrary, fast-track stops going to Bratislava.
Less speedsters will also come out on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, in principle the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
From the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction of transport in the Králové Hradec region, by a total of eight percent, on the contrary Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy the increase.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor route - České Budějovice and the operation of several speedsters on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovický must transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the suburban Esko system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance connections to the capital will end in the destination station Prague Main Railway Station.
ČD introduces more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka / Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
Pendolin to Bratislava is no longer a passenger ride from December 13th.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport is ordering and paying for the express, total to cover the so-called demonstrable loss will give the expensive four billion crowns next year, as well as this year. The lockers are ordering the counties, total they will pay eight billion crowns next year, with less than three billion counties contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The runways have a new ten-year contract for local and fast cars, so far the contract has been for one year.
Routes commend the system, which is probably why they did not reach for the price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will occur only with the ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of ELiška will depend on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform between any regional towns and amounted to 160 crowns.
Filipino militants are still holding more than 50 people, children released
Armed forces today in the south of the Philippines have kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
It was reported by an AFP agency that originally reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say approximately 19 armed men are using the hostages as a living shield to escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police originally pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that required the handling of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law has been declared because of the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the election to the governor's office.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this South Filipino province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, was arrested by the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Filipino government.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman, aka Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated) is coming to American cinemas, which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The role of the world-famous Apartheid Warrior was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he said Mandela chose for his own rendition years ago.
The supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francoise Pienaara was hosted by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film into cinemas, the reviews of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahl Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mjew.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Mind, then in 1993 along with the de Klerk Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations, as they come to the public at a time when, on the one hand, preparations for the world championship in football are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time, worrying news of rising racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black majority is shaking the media.
According to the AP news agency, responses to the new film in South Africa are, for the time being, largely positive, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the main roles of the "loony" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new film.
I've been dreaming of that role for years, and I've been preparing for it well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to - as they say - draw on his energy in an interview after the gala premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good idea if we can use the film to commemorate Mandela's personality and message.
It's the story of South Africa, but it concerns every man, he added.
In the National Rugby Team jersey
A picture based on a book paper by British writer John Carlin with a freely translated title as the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation depicts South African human rights advocates during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, during the film, tries to bring together two race groups and, for many years, mutually defined groups of the population and, as in 1995, Nelson Mandela, also entered the role of actor in the South African national rugby jersey on the field of the World Cup, which was then won by JAR.
For entering the lawn in a jersey, which is seen as almost sacred in South Africa, Mandela harvested a large ovation of a predominantly white audience 14 years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, introduced by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve will yet appear.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as a fan of Christopher Dawson's rugby who fled the country to Britain, for example, in a recent LN interview.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
There is a transformer burning in Lounsk for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was seized in the morning by the transformer of Čeps in the substation near the village of Vysov in Lounsk.
In the fire, according to the spokesman of the Ústí county firefighters, Luke Marvan has six units.
Originally, the firefighters wanted the transformer to burn, but later they reconsidered the view and the fire extinguishes the mixture of water, foam and special fascists.
The cause was a technical glitch, an internal short-circuit transformer.
No one was injured, the crash according to the spokesperson of Pavla Mandata's company does not threaten the secure operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it can be accurately quantified after the fire has ended.
According to Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In ten years of operation of Čeps nothing similar happened, defects of this type are unique, supplemented.
According to ČEZ's spokesperson for northern Bohemia, Soni Holinger Hendhurová was not interrupted, the operation of households, offices and companies did not affect the fire of the transformer station.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive operator of the transmission system, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 power stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and lines of 4339 kilometres in length.
Jančura will file a criminal complaint for defamation at the three presidents of the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura is now filing a complaint against three social-democratic governors.
This is for Michal Haška from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubice Region and the President of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesarik.
Jančura said it in 20 minutes of Radiojournal.
The action is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in certain regions.
But all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, and we only brought an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation against the Student Agency, said Radiojurnál Jančur.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all counties that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hashek considers the filing of a criminal complaint to be a further continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement by his companies and his own persons.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and my country, and I will also call on the other governors to do the same.
I suppose, on this occasion, it will also become clear that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jančura announced last week that he was investing several million crowns in advertising, which would point out the inconvenient step of the regions.
He told the radio station he was going to stop the campaign after Christmas and continue after New Year's Eve.
He stated that the campaign would be waged against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančur after the regions had agreed to operate regional railway links with the Czech Railways and to order around CZK 150 billion they did not write tendras.
According to Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur has already been threatened by an MEP for ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSPD, I know which man he is, I will not say his name, he said today to Radio Jancur.
Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
The anti-pneumococcal vaccination since January will break down experienced habits.
It should be the first for families free and at the same time optional.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The drug institute already sets the maximum price for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clear on the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
Children born on or after 2 August last year may be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge from January.
The condition is that they have not received a single dose of vaccine.
Whoever started the vaccination last year or before has to pay for the next booster vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of the families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococci.
Parents paid CZK 1,600 for one dose or more.
Four doses are required when injecting the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend between 300 and 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But it saves on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500 grand a year on all child vaccination.
The suspended vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumocok causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain DNA and blood poisoning.
For pneumococcal infections in our country, up to 28 children under the age of 10 will die in hospitals in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced paid flat vaccination of children against pneumococci in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it is to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
For example, the head of the Civil Association Nahlau Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at the international conference that our association participated in were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been achieved.
I think that's the path we need to take now, said Kalovský.
But the health department doesn't want to change the anti-pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this point we are not considering it at all, said his spokesperson Vlastimil Hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctor says
The President of the Professional Society of Practical Children's Doctors Hana Cabrnoch recognises that she has voluntary vaccination of her disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of overvaccinations "In a situation where this vaccine costs so much, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci by more than 80 percent of their new parents from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also a breakthrough in the fact that health insurance companies, not the State, are the first to pay for vaccination of children on the surface.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving it for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
The doctors will have to buy the fabric themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of practical pediatricians who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and should be received by doctors in the same way that the State supplies them with substances for other vaccines.
Some Members, however, feared that this would allow insurance companies to "extract money from health insurance."
Physicians will therefore have to buy the drugs and wait for insurance to pay them back.
According to estimates, individual practitioners will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'stole from a museum'
The son of the renowned American inventor, Frank Frazetta, was accused of trying to rob paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr. Frazetta and the other man were used to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region by a backpacker.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81 years old, became famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Associated Press Press.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Mr Frazetta Jr. might have been motivated to act by long-standing family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger affidavit, 52 years of age, that he did so on his father's instructions, "to get into the museum in any way possible and to move the paintings into the freshening area," as the agency said.
Mr Frazetta Sr. denied any such permission, as stated by the Agency.
Labour is resisting the planned tax increase
The minimum advocates the increase in taxes and the cut in expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Torys have "wasted" the opportunity to show that they mean a serious postponement of the deficit reduction decision until after the election.
Even the Chancellor has been under fire because of the disability of low and middle income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Diversity in social insurance
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession that they did not blame and warned ahead of "problems."
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of around £3 trillion per year - which has outraged the community of entrepreneurs who said that it is a labor tax, while focusing on the recovery of the economy should take place.
This increase, which is limited to more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINT PBR
Social insurance will increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase in 1% of company tax for depreciation of small companies
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase in pension measurement by 2,5%
According to an estimate by the state tax administration, some of the revenue of £30000 will be reduced by £90 a year and some of the revenue of £40,000 will be reduced by £190 while some of the revenue of £10,000 will increase by £110.
The ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decision-making," but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of people with the highest incomes.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely the basic requirement for the next four years," said the BBC.
Mr Timms said that he believes that the growth of the economy should take place at the turn of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of the necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise the earlier amounts.
In his opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75% this year - far worse than the decline in 3.5% predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A missed opportunity.
Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday to warn of the "debt crisis" of the Labour, have called the planned loan £789 trillion over the next six years as intolerable.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan on how this could be paid for, adding, "cynically," postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They did not add anything significant that would be feasible," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals, and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tori proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal democrats argue that money obtained by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, and argue that plans are "built on sand."
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson mentioned the timing of the communications - for example, inflation will increase and the benefits will be incapacitated next April - that this could lead to an indictment by the Chancellor in the election campaign if money is difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be reviewed on September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Even though ministers did not publish the details of spending after 2011, economists stated that it was clear that the reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The recognised Institute of Budget Studies has said that the chancellor's figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially in the budgeted area include transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Deloitte's accounts.
"That was the report on the suspect's preliminary budget, which is being implemented by the markets."
The FBI is conducting an investigation into US prisons in Pakistan.
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a prison in Pakistan with five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda, East Punjab province, as the BBC reported to the US Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether they were the same men who were reported missing in their last month resident in the American state of Virginia.
The US State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are reported to be native to Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested to know under what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," said Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit has reported that the agents have been informed of the arrest and have been in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in washington said that men were arrested in a house that belonged to one of their uncles.
It stated that the house was always at the heart of local police and that no charges have been filed against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, reported by Reuters, but stated that the United States had "to work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The disappearance of these five students from their home in Northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
The rejection of amnesty for the Iranian abusers.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, as stated in the Amnesty International Group's report.
The report describes in detail the "methods of torture" in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was in danger of being raped.
Iran denied the aforementioned criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have described this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran, and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them have been placed under arrest and the prosecutors have sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that earlier in protests, the Supreme Leader Ayyatollah Ali Khomeini declared that certain methods of torture were not justified and prohibited them from being carried out at Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
False confession '.
Amnesty International quoted the report of a 26-year-old computer scientist named Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he had been charged with "working with Facebook" and protesting against election results.
"They often beat me in the face," he said in the statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, she said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Charroubi, was arrested after the elections and tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants denied rape charges, but admitted torture was committed.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former prisoner who stated that he had been held in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election unrest and government responses, but stated that the mandate and powers of the institutions were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were published.
The group stated that at least 90 persons have been detained in the last three weeks in order to avoid further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the memory into a racetrack for the race in Bristol.
The downhill track for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill track in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski jump bridge in front of a 100 m long slope.
A fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the slope, but that it was really depressing.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents, "he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the slopes.
After Thursday evening's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on minaret construction, and in general, there are alarming reports of alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they integrated - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, have become admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French do not like headscarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study on disputed issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what really happened on the ground.
He spent months in mosques, schools, and institutes now taking care of 5 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He's a good listener, reproduces debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them the most.
Should Muslim enter marriage in a mosque or city hall (or both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These are these seemingly secular issues that are being discussed and which are part of everyday life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others well-known persons, including Tariq Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a debate on how to be a good Muslim at the same time and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are mistrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen has interviewed are inclined to believe that this is the opposite of Selafi - supporters of Purist Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia - the group is small, but it affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He asks how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so harshly advocates the lay public) really are committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republics.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "tightening the screws of values."
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now."
The most bleak prospect in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than any other environment on the planet.
The bordering ice melts at alarming speed, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they are awakened.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icons of the North, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling describes the long tradition of polar explorers trying to take over a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old lifeguard who only fought the musket is a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears who swam behind the bodies of their mothers just killed were caught and sent to the zoo and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed simultaneously in one circus tent.
Even today, zoo fences typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hair of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
While hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted from helicopters and Indians on skis and all armed with powerful offensive towels to shoot their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "On Ice" Alun Anderson, a former editor of the New Scientist, offers a clear and dismal responsibility for science for the Arctic and a captivating glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not everything scientists have answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
That's for lack of exams.
At the end of 19th and early 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen's research routes indicated for the first time how the floating ice was moving.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting ones as they floated.
Satellite exploration and extensive fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many still take place thanks to fearless individuals camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking into an extremely fragile world of falling systems inside the Arctic ice, created by saltwater flow, which is shrinking during freezing.
But from the bear's output to the microscopic miracles, it's all doomed when the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it could be us. '
6000 Marines put wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on a soldier's grave, who never met him.
For him and the other Marines who made their way from Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, that was the day in which they paid tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson told us about the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I am trying to do.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veteran cemetery in several departments during a piety act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during the piety act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen undertake this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America that they lay in other states.
In this year, volunteers placed over 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, on Pentagon territory, on the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park, New York City, and on the memorial flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has spent more than $150,000 on the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she made a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband isn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way of returning what was making the sacrifice.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's kind of like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm cloth cloaks, volunteers passed through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for older graves from World War I and Vietnam because they are not visited as often as newer graves.
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together, as they carried the young pine tree to the gray tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red arch of the fows upper part.
Close to Section 60, where most veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, they have indeed remained silent.
The combined service organisations dedicated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the grim mood of the wars currently under way filled this area.
Some honestly cried, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud names, carved into stones, while others bowed down to look at little black and white nameplates, pushed into wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes from her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the last resting place of Sergeant Artillery David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. My son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government contractor who imported cell phones and laptops into the country, as stated by officials of the State Department on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, has worked for the company Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consulate officials, along with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to a detainee who was imprisoned on December 5th.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, create a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to take over the prices, but she has been denied permission.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of growing tension between Communist Castra's brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a "stalling tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the New York Times imprisonment on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used for text messaging, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's pay.
The use of the internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is forbidden.
Detaining an American in Cuba is a rare thing.
Most of the US citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind bars for criminal offences, such as drug smuggling, reported by Gloria Berben, a press secretary for the US interest section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Prisoners and detainees were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free cell phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the US Human Rights Group programme, who recently published an unfavourable report on freedom in Cuba, entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and compensation for the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that all solutions would be rather political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative response in the United States, just as these two countries are headed for a wider dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are unraveling a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered the alleged leader of the conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops there, and said that they were hoping that this case might help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters who are snooping around the Internet looking for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray rebel figure, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men published a comment, authorizing terrorist attacks on YouTube's website.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, trying to help them reach a remote region of Pakistan in the Pakistan Native Tribe Zone, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in incriminating al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the menacing mountains of the northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The official who spoke about maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case stated why they were dropped.
The official said that the men were not intimidated and were still trying to gain approval to gain access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested for exercising Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI - underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, identifying who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the US intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
American fake recruits have been subjected to a special investigation in al-Qaeda, reported by analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American objectives and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the US, said that terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years, allowing the Kohu to access them because US intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been watched so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action.
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday and demanded stronger climate action from negotiators at the Bella City Congress Centre.
The protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police deplore that the number was closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists placed several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day of a minor incident in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists were passing through the city, carrying signs with the English inscription "This is not a B planet" (i.e. a second-class one) and one in Spanish that proclaimed "Earth says' enough '.
Several celebrities, including a Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, took part in the protest, who stated that she had travelled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information on the bleak state of the country in which the effects of climate change still take place.
That's part of the reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be carried out, it cannot be avoided.
The police stopped the protesters from getting close to downtown Bell and said that they had 19 people in custody, primarily because they had either masks on them or they had pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits have placed several charges close to Copenhagen's main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, they began to engage with flares, but then followed by "several large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn't penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China's leading climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of."
Then he went on to Chinese and said, "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
You can see the focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that this is a violation of the behaviour or freedom of other persons.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's Federal Certificate on Achievement of Mathematics was a welcome element of good news about Columbia Public Education.
Although the district is far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth class pupils over the last two years than in cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures of the National Attestation Center for the Advancement of Teaching are the continuing differences in the knowledge achieved between African-Americans and white students, both local and national.
In the last two years, the average result of white pupils in the fourth classes of Columbia has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but in their African-American peers there have been only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in the knowledge achieved has increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
The advancement of African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a shift of statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-class pupils in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the district, was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children in the oboia groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly closer to 58.
In the last week, some teachers in the district have said that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D), were more widely stimulated by white students where high results were already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the amount of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, C.E.O. of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of education in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down for a scatter of two or three points, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown Committee (D-At Large) who has a daughter in the fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticising the governance style of Mrs Rhee, Mrs Brown said that the report on the test results means secondary education in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what is appalling is that we have devoted almost no time and energy to our middle education.
Mrs Rhee said that the district's goal is to continue to look for better ways to focus on the needs of low-performance students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new syllables of reading, Wilson's reading system, aimed at students of upper classes of primary schools and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their school careers and are significantly lagging behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and syllabus of mathematics to the sixth grade, highlighting the games and experiences of real life that came to the district as former director of Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of the NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think that we should continue our work and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class, Mrs Rhee said.
Others have said that the results of the NAEP have made clear the question of whether Mrs Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and resources for low performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It is a certain reserved dilemma for Mrs Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley where she studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy process is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political responses that are directed against an important agenda.
But the complaint also belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the middle average between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can count on their children to be given excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now headmaster of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the fundamental element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to make schools justified.
You have to get up to 200 days to push for change, said Mr. Janey, who made a contract with his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he regards as a "symptom" for looking for a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus drove into Gettysburg College with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got out and laid down for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the attic of the college.
Now she and other eighth-grade pupils in the group examined Gettysburg, where the tuition fee was $38690 a year, their position was rather than frightened visitors excited potential students.
Yes! That's it! she called out Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? She spoke in thought when they were told the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania College was one of the seven that they visited on their three-day tour and were now completely interested in the future news: the question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a notable problem concerning the high number of born US children of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from universities or who become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive school education and thus join the middle class.
In fact, one fifth of this "rainbow generation" of Spanish college pupils - remarkable results show that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, have made it to the United States without graduating from college.
Their story of success is important, given by researchers, because it underlines their point of way forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who achieved higher education say that they had a natural attachment to school and a congenital penetration and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high targets for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programmes also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to go to college - especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we take into account that I come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them norient in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from Latin America.
We need to think about giving these children a detention network at a pre-school age in all ways to pass through college.
The federal program that financed Graciela's trip along the tracks is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (add up), provides over $300 million a year for local education systems to run railway preparatory programmes that begin for students from low income groups in secondary schools and continue until these students graduate from high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, more than% of whom have entered colleges, according to the US Department of Education.
Iraq's Department of Oil reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to reconstruct their sickly infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the recovery of Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies left with a capital stake in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
Only one has submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached agreements on fields auctioned in June.
America's oil giants' modest participation in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here in the first place on the road of the Asian and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That will be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to discourage US companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has proven to have the third largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, US firms have been at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other governments-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk taking, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that made deals with the Ministry.
America's leading companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Department of Oil and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were senior shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The state of China National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic force, as well as the technological force, said the spokesman for the oil industry, Assam Jihad.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to competition and will live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that have been provisionally selected to submit offers, which have then been compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening output above the current levels on each field.
Al Qaeda's top planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
On the impact of the US missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, the top al-Qaeda operations planner, as announced on Friday by US anti-terrorism officials, was apparently killed.
As confirmed, it could be the second deadly attack on one of the top leaders of terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets landed in a quarter on their car near the town of Miran Śáh in the province of North Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have taken the idea that missiles were launched from an unmanned aircraft of the type with which the CIA operates in an illegal tribal zone.
They were pointed at a white car that was headed towards the Afghan border when it was hit, an official named along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency that was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local gunmen had rushed to the point and quickly confiscated what was left of "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two American officials from the anti-terrorism department quoted an unspecified witness who stated that Somali was dead.
Somali was referred to as a high-ranking al-Qaida military operations planner who led operations by terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in planning all over the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be appointed, who indicated the sensitive nature of American air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaida's Supreme Command and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another American official said that Somali quickly progressed in the hierarchy of al-Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person for some Americans, but that he had not humiliated himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban who should have been killed since September when Najmudin Yalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the Native Tribe Zone, was killed in a similar attack, and three other top post-operative leaders.
The pace of attacks initiated by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has decreased since summer from approximately six operations per month to two, according to the records of Long War, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have a reason for improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people who suspected they were informants, listed the site.
United Nations top delegate in Kabul has resigned.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to withdraw from his post in March to end the turbulent term of office that was thwarted by allegations of widespread corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure is taking place because the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate stated that it supported growth, but expressed concern that the US schedule for a reduction that starts in 18 months should be a challenge for other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghan people that they should have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees helping to transform Afghanistan politically.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
Like I said, it's high time we looked for the successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started looking for a replacement.
Officials have stated that it is decided between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, the French who had previously led the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but he said that the charges against Galgraith -- who was released -- "certainly damaged the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism in terms of international intervention" in the election.
Eide said that he was proposing a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens to coordinate the easing of efforts in the leadership of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, because, as he says, he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine its ability to exploit its capabilities.
The UN rules are that I have had the opportunity to acquire only one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon impose "other significant sanctions" on Iran due to lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq during a week's trip to areas where war is at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, downgraded the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
That's not a good choice for Iran, said in response to a soldier's question of probable development. "
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inevitable unpredictability in war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and barriers" would require "to force the Iranian government to truly feel less secure with nuclear weapons," because "its inhabitants will suffer exceptionally" sanctions.
According to a Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration involved European leaders in the warning that Iran would bear serious consequences unless it brought its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Committee on Nuclear Security and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks about limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of his uranium-enriched reserves in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way of establishing confidence between the two parties and buying time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the interim agreements - partly because of this, the expert states, because the IRS is divided into views on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, with regard to Iran's stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals that it actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to search for other elections, including surveillance, which was once called "degrading sanctions" by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the UN condemned on Thursday what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" in front of some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he left for Kurdistan, oil-rich to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions remain between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, particularly because of borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to prevent the delay of US plans to limit US troops from 115,000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen Kurdish concern about the ongoing depression. The official US positions quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzai, President of the Kurdistan regional government, "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you. "
In aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave."
Then they learned that when official government posts in Shanghai, alerted by low birth rates and the ageing population in their city, they suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to exactly one child.
We didn't save anything for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years of China's policy to have only one child has been introduced, thereby creating two generations of only notoriously lumpy and pampered children, the affectionately nicknamed "small emperors," a country threatened by population crises.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before it entered into force in politics, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population of 60 years of age and above is predicted to grow in a turbulent manner from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of around 20 per cent.
The imbalance is a larger rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above accounted for almost 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children in order to "help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and reduce the number of workers in the future."
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual calming
As it was inserted into the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate under the rule of the Communist Party.
The couples who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official posts have pursued a policy that has helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned to pursue policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions in the second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexist choice abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including urban residents, members of national minorities, and cases where male and female were only children - and in 2007 reduced the dictation of their hard-line passwords.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Population Research Institute, said that central government officials had previously discussed more radical changes, as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incite more births.
Almost overnight, posters, encouraging parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations, detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put flyers under their doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, reported by family planning officials.
Zarmutant response
Even though officials in one rural city around Shanghai have noticed an increase in interest among couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most city districts have not reported changes.
Huinan City District with a population of 115000, for example, has still registered four to five cases a month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Caol's Shanghai quarter said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she'd like to have two children, and they were legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese who only have inadequate health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docal gripping net, the choice could be irresponsible.
The people of the West are mistreating one child's politics as a questionable legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is married to the first child in the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child, because she was also an only child: "We were at the center of the attention of our families and everyone cared for us.
We weren't used to providing care, and we didn't really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who own the translation company, expressed it much more unobscured.
For two-carer middle-class parents who reduced birth rates, he said being successful means being selfish.
Today, 20 and 30-year-olds view parents as the first days of a Chinese experiment with capitalism, and they don't want this way of living for themselves, he says.
It's one child who makes enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the questions of the proploster -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and strategies -- "You have to have the résumé ready at a time when the child is nine months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, he says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has outlined a plan for reducing emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching, undisciplined attitudes and mutual harassment -- has once again focused on Friday on releasing a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the near future.
The text that can provide a basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But there was an important progress in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unequivocally states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of the global temperature rise that political officials will still be able to tolerate.
This will give the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, head of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed a six-page document, shortening from 180 pages of the text from the negotiations to focus on what the top climate officer at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture."
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent in comparison with 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50% and 95%.
On Friday, the European Union discussed the promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptation to climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But still Friday mentioned the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in the talks last week.
The United States Special Envoy for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected the speech calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared to the voluntary nature of major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The shift signalled that the Obama administration had set a tougher line towards China just two years ago, as Bush administration officials did.
The United States will not accept a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the US's chief negotiator on climate issues that either the lack of "common sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" led earlier in the week to a message that the United States would not have helped China financially to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the major world powers at stake, havoc has erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States on fulfilling their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative for carrying out stronger actions.
Ricardo Ulate, the delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers responsibly in their actions.
It is clearly a game about the development of new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor in the field of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to enforce a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the major participants have said that the political agreement will be the best outcome of the talks.
The alliance of small island states, with 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that the promotion of small island nations "has caused political clash to the whole political process" partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations brought about a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they have to resolve most of the remaining issues at issue before the Heads of Government compete for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environmental Protection Jairam Rames and the Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of airplanes and ran through the halls of downtown Bella to the closed door of meetings and new conferences so that they could set out the claims to be assessed next week.
The sheer extent of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved daily from and to the convention center, guitar-playing activists staged at night the ironic spectacle of the countries they thought they had sent, and the hand-to-hand transfer of designs on paper was carried out rather than by e-mail -- controlled by a challenge.
Intensity is only an extension: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier on in the centre of 60 Heads of State.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Secretary of Global Policy on International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming in.
The British first train at 140 miles per hour redefined this Monday's feelings
At 5: 13 a.m. Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness as a sign of the departure of the train, which revolutionised transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent to London's St Pancras and cross the distance of 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed personal kit outside of lndýn.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
The missed standing water should be reduced in passenger transport times and on commercial routes, and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties have allowed themselves to be acquired for this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds necessary to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now hampered the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a viable study to the government, passed on its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as indicated by the Times.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of another planned high-speed network.
The new route between London and West Midland has been designed within five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where it could be problematic to reach a life centre.
Within 25 m of the final route was planned in the open landscape.
HS2 also foresees three options for a large-scale high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a "Y "-shaped confiscation, where one high-speed line should lead to West Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle above Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most powerful choice has been made," he said and the rail expert.
As soon as this is done, the time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should enable trains to travel at 2250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to carry 400 m trains capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that an existing station would expand to accommodate a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be made before the general election.
Even if it sets wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed lines, but already existing lines north of Birmingham, and they should maintain travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a crucial point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, an indicative point for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of £75000 on the Toryu orangery.
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Toryu front seat bench in the House of Deputies, paid the taxpayers thousands of pounds of the cost of the orange juice he built in his house in the constituency last year.
The party spokesman for the prison that was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs were living "on rations," raised his mortgage to £75000 to build oak-lined expansion in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims on time, so he was not interrogated by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out a check on membership expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan made his demands "menohlo it to be cleaner or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is marked in the plans as "orange."
Neighbors describe it as "a greenhouse for entertainment and entertainment."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the poplar security to a mortgage of £271406 from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Deputies.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1400 a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over 1800 pounds per month.
The interest in Mr. Duncan's RBS mortgage payments could not have changed at this time, which suggests that it was all intended to finance a loan of £75000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payments fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, while remaining.
The last paper by the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 a month this May.
Mr Duncan left his work as the shadow head of the House in September after a secret fixer filmed it and said that Members had to live "on rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically, it's nationalized, you have to live on rationing, and you're treated like a * * t."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn stake, but I won't. "
An MP, a millionaire of his former career as an oil dealer, was first invited to explain his issues in May when it turned out he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the Financial Office, that it "may be considered excessive."
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 for three years.
When he was asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the Financial Office and then by Legg."
He added: "this is not a controversial question of hiding and zigzag or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's absolutely a straight line down, by the rules, justified, and that's it.
This would not be required by many others to be cleaner or simpler. "
Come and see the cabin on the brighton coast with an advent calendar.
The coastal cottages in Brighton found a new sense of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages a hollow pursuit of creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas carols as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when it allowed visitors to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and a bishops bread and welded wine provided free of charge.
The selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage represented the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant to TV marketing from Hove, is a priest without a scholarship in the Chichester diocese and head of Beyondo.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to an alien old building? I feel that the church should come to the people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in cottages was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place, and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way. "
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went on the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to the organisers, have manifested themselves in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is aimed at adopting an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, declared that the growing global mobilization, with clear evidence of the current manifestation, would have contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of any failure in Copenhagen would have been too high.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began to break the windows of the palm cubes and hammers.
The law enforcement immediately stepped in.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," the ultra-radical separate groups, which had already taken place in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, East France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "indiscriminately" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and sitting down "kept in the streets on Saturday night" despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade went quietly to the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 yards from the building without trying to break in.
A stage was built for speakers, before which there was a spiritual meeting by candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities, and apart from Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Korean.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, created the first assembly in Copenhagen in the morning, at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate."
Today, we are going to the streets to demand an environmental debt settlement in favour of the South, explained by Lida Nappilova, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say, "It's time for that," said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and rivers are drying up, we can walk in them today, and that has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world has approached environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice." "There is currently no difference between combating global warming and fighting for another world."
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to the organizers, there were about 50,000 people on the streets.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, wearing red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators have gone on the streets demanding a strong measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350" movement protests, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Several dozen people have gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has chosen her president, Georgia condemns it as a "farce."
Abkhazia chose its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this move a "farce."
Some 131000 people were invited to take part in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 to control South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory, recognised by Russia.
Election rooms closed at 17pm GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazi Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the polls closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia that condemned this election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian rule," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognised the independence of this territory with 216.000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world regards it as part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through the elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said AFP Kvarčija Svetanova, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling room at the school in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea bank, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216.000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapš are deployed alongside Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials, who came to oversee the successful election, received a warm welcome from the district mayor of Beslan Arshba.
"We Abchaz are grateful," he said in a small ceremony, bearing in mind the support of Moscow and, in particular, its decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament and a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised contracts concluded with Moscow last year, such as a treaty that allowed Russia to control the Abkhazia rail network for a period of 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
To win the election, an absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates achieve this result, the decisive battle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went on the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested about 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to the organizers, manifested the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013, until 18 December.
After leaving Parliament, the parade went quietly to the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 yards from the building without trying to break in.
A stage was built for speakers, before which there was a spiritual meeting by candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents shortly after the passing of the parade, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black and armed bricks and hammers, began to break the windows.
The law enforcement immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, and knocked several manifestants to the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," the ultra-radical separate groups, which had already taken place in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, East France.
Late this afternoon, a paving block was injured by a police officer on his jaw and four cars were set on fire near a squat located near incidents that resulted in police arrest of about 20 people.
We're focusing on extremist groups, alerting police spokesmen Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police blew up again.
Most protesters who arrived by bus or train from the major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were a lot of Asian people, including some Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, created in the morning in Copenhagen the first assembly at the call of the Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate."
Today, we are going to the streets to demand an environmental debt settlement in favour of the South, explained by Lida Nappilova, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice." "There is currently no difference between combating global warming and fighting for another world."
Oxfam has summoned several known personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to the organizers, there were about 50,000 people on the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and with scarves evocative to the importance of solar energy, manifested themselves in front of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators have also met with the demand for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350" movement protests, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Several dozen people have gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the Gymnasium, said Chatel.
The Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, said on Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" in the context of the reform of the Gymnasium, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the final year of Gymnasium, focusing on exact sciences.
Now all the students of the second year will have four hours a week and for everyone will be the same program from general culture, confirmed by Chatel.
According to the Minister, "hypocrisy is needed," because according to him, the specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences, "but" essentially the best students are in it. "
The specialization of the EC and L cannot be for a kind of sub-specialisation, it continues and stresses: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would make it difficult to learn geography and history in the senior year of vocational gymnastics."
The Ifop survey, published by the Humanite daily on Saturday, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography teaching in the senior year with S specialization, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticised this abolition, both the left and some Members of the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "out of the question" to abolish philosophy in the programme of specialization with the senior year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organisations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilisation against this project, which they say sacrificed the educational education of future high school professors.
As part of Master's degree 2 (M2), the Minister explained at the beginning of the year of the admission examination focused on their field and at the end of the year another examination to verify their ability to teach.
They will take part in professional traineeships during the second year of Master's studies and will be present as a professor-intern before pupils for the first year.
If you add up all the traineeships you will be offered before the admission procedure, you will get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education," which does not yet exist in national education.
Reconfirmed the school map cancellation project by 2012.
At the elite university of the École Normale supérieur, experts have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, the Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of Ecole normale supérieur on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist informed, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts to be filmed and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something to attract people, and on the basis of which they would be more eager to learn something more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who received a name from a fish from a local pond named by the students.
Some twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
We can talk about climate warming for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes', said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without prior comments, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, stressed with the hope that the audience will recognize that the "Copenhagen Conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific foundation."
Videos recorded at these lectures will be placed on the website of the school since December 15.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Late payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
The prison guards' departments announced "general mobilisation" on Friday, demanding that premiums and overtime be refunded by Christmas holidays, the payment of which was postponed for financial reasons until January.
The prison FO (the 2nd Peacekeepers' Department) has asked the staff who will not be on duty to attend a demonstration held on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities to "block them" to draw attention to the "theft of their wages."
The CGT for the prison guards (3rd trade unions of this sector) called on them to "convene a meeting in individual prisons and to start a major mobilization," with the fact that it is "shameful and unacceptable," so that "overtime and overtime payments for work at night, Sundays and holidays" worked in October are not paid in December.
The first Peacekeepers' Union, the Federal Union of Prison Peacekeepers (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for total mobilisation (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and indignation."
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and have not all been included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellor stated that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison guards' unions to reassure them that payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the secretary writes in her communication.
I have ordered the administration of prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which resulted from the poor evaluation of the number of overtime, will never be repeated in the future, is brought to the attention of Minister Alliot-Mari.
Therefore, the December wage will be low, except for managers who receive famous bonuses for performing their functions and meeting their objectives, and for those "there is always room in the budget."
It is simply a scandal, an interregional FO union in Marseille enraged and announced its decision to boycott "all meetings and subpoenas" until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, unless they are paid extra for these days of October in December, as well as overtime, there is also a risk of FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when they are giving us more and more jobs and more tasks without giving us additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for it, reports CGT-prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of them are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are low, stated by Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better presents" at Christmas than the ones he gets
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided in the "goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that, as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better presents than the ones I receive."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show that will be broadcast to ABC on Sunday night about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged family companion, gets his fill.
Baby Jesus likes Bo, too, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog also "of course" gets a gift, as is apparent from the excerpts from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's statement on the quality of gifts that she gets: "Oh, no, I gave you fine gifts last year," teased the president.
Well, of course that's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after that, he pointed the finger at the First Lady's pearl necklace, "And who gave you this?"
In this one-hour, very relaxed show with a famous host who has been strenuously supporting Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the husbands also spoke to Obama about their most popular gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a ten-stage gearbox bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely met at Christmas.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas, and when he gave me the basketball, the president told me.
It was long after that that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The First Lady remembered the dollhouse again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, and Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL states he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to "injuries" resulting from a major operation he had had in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his closest ones, while RTL reported that the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
A 66-year-old rocker was reoperated on Wednesday Thursday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after US doctors stated "injuries resulting from an operation" excavated plates he had in Paris on November 26, reported to his press department in Paris, saying that these lesions required "repair surgery."
However, the singers' press department sought to reassure the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to prevent "pain and complications."
In 48 hours, by the time the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more confident, he's supplying RTL.
The press department, at the AFP query, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources," no drain was located after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at Parc Monceau International Clinic for a herniated disc.
The surgery, which was planned several days ago, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL information.
After this surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through a "bad time," but added that he didn't worry about the rocker, "because he's a big" fighter. "
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like this is no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed down the situation, who said that Johnny Hallyday "responds well to antibiotics," and that the infection was "stopped."
Mr. Camus also said that he met with Laetitia, the singer's wife, and that he didn't notice any particular concerns.
The health problems of the singer have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small colon tumor" and then on a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66," which is presented as his bachelorette.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been watched and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to demean the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009 / small swimming pool: Premier Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large swimming pool, won a title at the 2009 European Championship in a small swimming pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m free way.
Only three world records fell on the first day of the championship, although much more were expected.
One of them surpassed the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verraszt for 200 m position race and two remaining male relay Russia for 4x50 m position race.
A great grief for Bousquet, who has taken the lead on the world record in a 50 m free way, which he already holds in the big pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, 50m free way, 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, on which the prime minister started ten swimmers instead of a regular eight.
Bousquet defeated Croat Djo Draganja (20.70) and Rusa Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record was in my reach, I'd try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1st.
Combineses helped from February 2008 to 238 world records, and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first host to host them at the same competition in 1999.
The use of the jumpsuit this time did not help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in a large swimming pool in Rome this summer, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to break the record, which holds for 400 metres the free way (3: 32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3: 34.55), before Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82)
I didn't put everything I had into that race.
I knew I couldn't beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, explained by Biedermann.
USA: The record of the Romanesque sarcophagus belonging to Zola was auctioned for USD 1.5 million
The record of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to none other than the French writer Emil Zola, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said the art dealer Sotheby's.
The price of this two meters long and 63 cm high front plate, dating back to the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionysus scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyra and bacchantas is a rare work, similar pieces in the world are very few, perhaps four or five," said AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The piece was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still going on, but it is the subject that was most likely bid on, communicated to AFP spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was found a few days ago.
The record was in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bath with her in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France, and shortly before joining the power of Marshal Petaine.
That's where she stayed shrouded for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered when searching the museum database in the Louvre that this plate was part of the "remnants of Emil Zola" opened from 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and frescoes "Rougon-Macquart."
Intermittent attempt to remove President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico concluded that the conditions for the transport of overthrown President Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not met.
After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, all of which suggests that there is no way to carry out this transport, said the Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya has flown back again, mentioned the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The purgatory government wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only in this way would it be able to leave safely.
But the overthrown president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of state.
The purgatory government "experienced another setback when it wanted me to give up my post (...), they wanted me to resign," said Zelaya Radio Globo on Thursday, in which she often spoke about the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added by the overthrown president, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept this because it does not contain a request for asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Pushy Government, Oscar Raul Matute to Honduras Radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum to any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for Telesur Station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'll leave as president of the Honduras people, stressing.
The rumors of Zelaya's departure were mobilized on Wednesday by supporters of the overthrown president who came to gather around the Brazil Embassy, where the army strengthened protection.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amori, criticized the position of the puchic government.
This shows their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to the Socialist President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day he organised public consultations in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica he unexpectedly returned on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out of here, he'll be arrested, and he'll be held responsible for the crime of "treason," which he's accused of, the coup d'état says.
On 29 November, President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections recognised by the United States, but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street is rising, the US trade balance is encouraging optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, and US trade balance results indicate an increase in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closure data, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68,78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7,13 points to 2190,06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from various parts of the economy, comments from Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on a "half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected the deficit to rise.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen to the lowest in the year, "said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The proceeds of State Treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3,482% compared to 3,423% on Tuesday night and the proceeds to 30 years increased to 4,492% compared to 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of the regime squealed "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime boosted the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights on Thursday and prevented another manifestation on which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Dam in White," wives or close political prisoners were booed directly on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime as they march towards the capital center, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist informed.
Down with the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!," "The streets belong to revolutionaries!," "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted with a raised fist advocates of the regime to dissidents.
Dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who arrived to "secure security."
The day before, there was a similar manifestation in Havana against "Ladies in White," but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, officers of the civilian police were arrested about ten dissidents, who were also about to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, reported to the AFP journalist.
According to this journalist, the police have loaded dissidents who have been boosted by the government's supporters into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The 2005 Sakharov European Parliament Prize holders, "Ladies in White" organised an unauthorized march for "the release of everyone, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," stated one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their arch-enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television brought news of Thursday's manifestation of the government's supporters against the "opponents of the revolution."
Cuba, with the Communist Party at the head and policy of the government of one Party, is regularly accused of non-respect for human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, by European or American NGOs.
A madman with a knife killed an 80-year-old man and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the assailant at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old male at or before the pharmacy, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of police and witnesses.
A badly wounded old man, born in 1929, died from the Police Syndicate Alliance in the hospital as a result of injuries.
At or before this pharmacy, the assailant attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband around the age of 30 began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs have been affected.
A pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as reported by a police source, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard of Jean Jaurès.
He injured two other people, probably by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other one seriously.
How all this happened is not quite clear, because it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried behind his back, said on the spot of the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several bystanders, including young people, have tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to the evidence gathered by the AFP.
I saw, like, a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation of Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
It was thrown by a crowd, including one city cop who broke his wrist, added.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to apprehend an armed man while being wounded by fists, reported a police source.
The incident took place on one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The bystanders have come to tell me that there's an injured person outside.
I went out, and I saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, I put him in a safe place, and I noticed a major abdominal wound, told AFP Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second, about 30-year-old person came along who also had knife wounds.
A man who didn't have his identity papers was arrested by the state police.
The Attorney General in Nanterre referred the matter to the County Police Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspect assailant was taken to the hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
A police source has not ruled out his location in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six police officers to handle him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "completely out of his mind" as "all crazies of this type whose power increases ten times in action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for an end to the prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Roman Polanski has again applied on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that took place 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, an attorney for the film director "Pianist," criticized in front of three judges the Court of Appeal of the second district in California the serious errors that occurred during the trial at the time of the 1977 event.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, said lawyer Hummel and added that from the behavior of the judge who made the decision at the time, Laurence Rittenband "had a chill in the back."
According to him, a judge (who had already died in the meantime) allegedly had to deal with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison - a serious offence against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and deprived" (Roman Polanski, wanted and requested), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally said at the end of September that he "lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will demand a trial in which he can present evidence of his claim.
The plaintiff repeated what was already said at the first state, namely that there will be no serious examination of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski is brought to justice.
A 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court passed a judgment on "illegal sexual intercourse" with a teenage girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
Deputy Prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case, we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants, that it is possible to escape? Asayam asks.
He believes that the director "asks the court for a favor while disdain his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed "that there are other escape alternatives'.
Lawyer Hummel wasn't the only one asking to stop Roman Polanski's prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also requested an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case emerged and added: "No one in this room could say that the trial was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland by order of the United States of America.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he waits for a possible sermon.
Wall Street ends with no direction, it's being held back by a rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday with no direction, the market fades between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: Dow Jones gained + 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closure data, Dow Jones Industrial Average progressed from 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with a technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, introduced by Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly, and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators which are better than expected and which "helped improve market mood in terms of stability of economic recovery," was summarised by the analyst Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, as of the second month in a row, and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of American consumers also returned and increased strongly in December up to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, indexes have been hampered by a new increase in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, "pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological stock is losing ground.
The securities market is down.
The yield of state treasures, with a 10-year view, rose to 3,540% compared to 3,482% on Wednesday night and with a 30-year view increased to 4,497% compared to 4,492% a day earlier.
Miss World's election again in South Africa.
After a month's travel across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year, and so far five candidates have gained progress in the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Mao from Canada were selected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen so many things, and I've had so many experiences, Miss Sierra Leone confided in me.
The competition that takes place in South Africa for the ninth time will be broadcast live from Midland, in the north of Johannesburg, from 17am (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country to put on a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy to have been able to experience it twice, confided in the Miss of the World of Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot South Summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "landscape that breathes."
After a month of performances, exams, press and safari meetings, Miss will now focus on the competition itself.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to take the steps of Priyana Chopra, elected in 2000, who also took part in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winners who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about looks.
We are the emissaries of our countries, and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimwear.
The performance will be presented by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee Chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome a world with warmth, which is hard to cope with, declared Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Competition.
As last year, candidates took part in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bike, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, noted by Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain of the draw in Cape Town (southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive."
The news of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive," as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday when he got off the plane, which he flew in from Paris just after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock world time)
The singer's son, who worked calmly, said that "as quickly as possible," would arrive at the Los Angeles hospital Cedars-Sinaï, which Johnny Hallyday was admitted to on Monday for post-operative infection resulting from an operation of a herniated intervertebral disc which he had undergone in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, this night in Los Angeles, a singer was "put into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles already put into an artificial sleep. The hospitalization occurred due to infection following an operation of herniated intervertebral disc in Paris on November 26.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again on Wednesday night on Thursday.
According to an AFP photographer, his wife, Laeticia, attended a school performance of a French lycee in Los Angeles, attended by their daughter Jade on Friday morning.
The head of the Orthopedic Surgery and Trauma Department of the Hospital of Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he is leaving for a singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer hard accused Dr Stéphan Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this journey was no problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself have suffered twice the discharge of an intervertebral disc, he added.
Just before that, RTL said that the singer probably left after the Paris operation without a tube, without anything. "
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic he was working on at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsstorm in the removal of the hematoma resulting from brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer at the Olivier Metzner Medical Chamber referred to him as "a man without scruples," who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber, and who cannot be "far from recommended."
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke to him on Friday through his attorney David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had a "perfectly good course" and the post-operative examination was "normal."
The operation was not haemorrhagic and therefore the introduction of the drain was not necessary, "he added.
The health problems of the singer have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with the question mark.
It is clear that the date for the resumption of the scheduled tour on 8 January (in Amiens, note rev.) seems too close, said Camus.
UDF increases the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre not to continue to enjoy their acronym.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin to claim the abbreviation of the former Giscard Party, stating that it must not use the abbreviation in any media under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the shortcut of UDF, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to carry her inheritance after he handed his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the Nouveau Centre National Council (NC).
This move was supported by Mr Hervé de Charette (former for-UMP now for NC), which is attributed to the ownership of the brand UDF because he had it registered in the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004 (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle).
But on Friday night, the UDF Committee, headed by friends François Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, stepped out of his silence and made a formal request to the Minister and Members to stop using the shortcut and hand back the possession of the trademark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the worrying statements that you will propose to take back your political movement + to take back the + shortcut of UDF, writing in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoD or Senator Jean Arthur of the Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name + Nouveau centre + on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement, with the slogan + UDF today +, also the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, the UDF Committee, which requests the NC movement "immediately remove all references to the name of the UDF from all promotional materials including (its) websites."
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of the trade mark to legitimate owners."
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories will point out.
In their letter, they stated that UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978," and recall that Mr Morin and his friends "chose" the exit in 2007, "in order to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to establish an UMP.
The Nouveau centre movement has therefore, according to them, no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF voted in 2007 to join MoD for three years and to set up a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues "when registered as a trade mark," "was not a member of UDF for three years," but an UMP.
He used non-existing acronyms in a scandalous and fraudulent manner to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then they say with irony about the NC strategy: "It seems to us that, both in politics and in normal life, it is worth creating a name for itself rather than stepping out of anonymity by fraudulent acceptance of a name to which we have no right."
The Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier and to pass judgment on whether or not he had used the age of weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, as her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames him.
The photographer (62 years), known for his famous photographs, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, an offence for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros is imposed.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, where mothers and daughters are attacking each other and fighting to manage the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by a college of three doctors.
The heir and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor during the investigation.
The doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010, at the same time expressing whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and in which period.
I think he'll go through with it.
I'll talk to her about the case, and after the hearing, Mrs Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman, said.
As for François Bettencourt-Meyers' attorney, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...). Expertise will show that it has been tampered with with with this old lady who needs protection (M. Banier).
It's been two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-time artist, who has been accused of using her mother's weakness for years to get a billion euros in cheques, life insurance contracts or masters' paintings.
However, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's lawyer's trial was at a moment's notice turning into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which she expressed her mistrust of François Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer, adds, "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to François. "
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor found that the complainant's actions were not justified, all the more so that the guardian judge rejected her request to open legal proceedings for her mother in those days.
Liliane Bettencourt 'is fully capable of taking part in the trial, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her, "confirmed the prosecution's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court of First Instance decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to comment at the time of the opening of the procedure.
A management revolution or an end to economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been futile...
For more than a decade, the behaviour of management of large companies vis-à-vis employees has been reminiscent of corporate access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about coworkers identifying themselves with "values" determined from the mountains, as was the case before, when consumers had to be forced to impose products that came from the ideas of factory technicians' heads.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the market-conquering strategy in the right direction... although authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, regularly return!
A passive approach by employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which affects mainly management cadres.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires an active approach and foresight from all stakeholders (...) and requires commitments from employees that are completely contrary to the revenue of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that should aim to put workers at the heart of the business as well as the client.
Relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that, in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it has always done after a different turn!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of thought convenience, they acquire an old behaviorist theory, currently revived by US "neuroscience" and widely disseminated without much knowledge by the scientific constitution and media.
With the possibility of moving "levers" (sic) involving managers, the recent Ipsos survey on the Figaro.fr website, which only reinforces the managers in their position of mechanical control, has shown that it is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating basic insights into all management intentions and practices: for employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of employee motivation is addressed only by studies of Motivative Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of pre-determined clauses, which will enable them, through an image which shows the company, to assess what they offer to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and counter their "social performance" and put their human resources management "on the right track."
This creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
A speech from Oslo: "just war" has earned Obama praise from the right.
On Friday, the American right welcomed Barack Obama's speech the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize winner for 2009 defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who initially mocked the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the Vice President in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican, said to the US Today newspaper, and added that she herself expressed the "sometimes necessary" wars in her memoirs that are currently coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans would want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists must be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces on Thursday in Oslo and used his speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the President did a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world."
In a way, I considered this speech quite historic, said Gingrich during the interview on "The Takeaway."
The former Member, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the "left-wing president" to remind the Nobel Committee members of the Nobel Prize, "that they themselves would not be free to pass on the peace prize if the use of forces did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, former author of the speeches by George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama presented "a very American speech."
Not only did he introduce himself as a "world citizen" as always, but "spoke like the US President" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they do not do too much to preserve it," Gerson assessed.
Among the few discontent of the right are the Hawks of the Bush era, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as "monotonous, pompous and without inspiration," as stated on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the view of Barack Obama, how he justifies the use of force.
"If we wrap war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-left press takes a commendable view of the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to regard the award of peace to Obama as premature, he assessed his performance as "overperformance," even for a speaker known for his talents.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression, "says the California daily with passion.
Obama "gave the speech as needed," evaluated the New York Times, and called it "simple and enlightening."
Road hauliers: three marathons to an agreement that saves supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, the unions of road hauliers and TLF, the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the call for strike and the threat that hung over the supply of Christmas supplies.
State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau expressed "joy" at Friday's signing of the agreement after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting that started at 11: 00 to all agree and at 18: 00 to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt businesses" and "there would be a risk of disrupting the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The text contains 4% wage increases for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we will order our members to avoid blockades, no blockade of supply centers.
But there may still be a few opponents who are not satisfied, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal," although it was hard to admit to raising high salaries in the face of international competition. "
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and EUR 100 to 120 per month for the highest ones.
This is a common sense and respect for employees agreement, said CMaxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement."
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a 'acceptable compromise'.
The agreement also envisages a 3% revalorisation of travel expenses and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also enable the focus to be on the issue of the 13th salary and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million in corporate payroll taxes" which was the subject of the Government's amendment to the draft bill on the 2009 budget, on which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night on Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for a "identical" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to companies that are members of this organisation, later to the whole field, in the event of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will be "as short as possible," assured Bussereau.
The whole process can only slow down the disapproval of employers' organisations.
The FNTR talks about "bad business" because EUR 100 million "has already been offered to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency not as a result of mutual analysis, but, in order not to upset turkey eaters at a time of approaching Christmas holidays, she complained to Unostra.
For Otre, the agreement is in danger of "burying a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field" in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: Intermission of traffic on the weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the design of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the trade unions and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the premium application.
On Saturday and Sunday, i.e. the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will only ride between 10: 00 and 20: 00, the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will be run by every other train, outside this section just one train out of four.
The link with SNCF will be interrupted at Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch trains.
Galeries Lafayette's shopping houses, expected every day by over 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to secure a connection with large trading houses."
The RER A line leads from west to east from Paris's conurbations.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in operation, and virtually none of the trains were in operation at the time of the peak, as planned.
Just as on Thursday, the people of Ile de France made a different arrangement, and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among other things because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up an hour and a half early to make sure he was on time.
The Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, it announced the SNCF state rail, because it predicted a larger number of officers and guards of order.
The suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
Other general meetings of strikers will take place on Saturdays and Sundays, where the results of Friday afternoon meetings with the leaders will be assessed as "weak."
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER A trains in all aspects, work time adjustment, career progress etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (Experts South).
The RATP has even postponed the premium proposals for the time being, which has upset the CGT, saying that the management "was unable to solve the problem, whereas it was possible for travel carriers and SNCF."
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, RATP's transport undertakings were specified "to examine the conditions of employment further."
Which was why the trade unionists thought the business was "making fun of weekend passengers."
In the morning about 150 drivers were occupied by the company committee in its Paris residence.
The leadership, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calming down."
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independent have announced a strike alert.
The departments apply for a premium of between EUR 120 (Unsa) and EUR 150, of which EUR 30 (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)), and make it difficult for them to get worse working conditions on this line, which carries millions of passengers on a daily basis.
RER suburban train drivers earn between EUR 2200 and EUR 2700 gross wages in the advanced career period and EUR 600 to 650 premiums for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the Kurdish party, and this decision bears heavy consequences.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court decided to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately provoked protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of a government that seeks to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand in trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Supreme Court, Hasim Kilic, after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when the majority-seven votes were needed for the dissolution of the party, said Kili, and added that 37 party cadres, including President Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysela Tugluk, were banned from taking part in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (500).
The party's leadership had already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political jurisdiction.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdulrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political display of the rebels of the PKK.
The party assures that it has no "basic link" with the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the court comes at a time when the government is giving the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and try to limit the support of the Kurds towards the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in south-east Anatolia, where many demonstrations have been reversed in recent weeks against the conditions under which the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcalan is being held in conflict with the police.
Since the justice decision was announced, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP's headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear grenades and water cannons, protestors threw Molotov cocktails or shot slingshot stones.
Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people demonstrated.
After the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the decision of justice would only "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurds, note.) by banning the party, declared it in the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We are by principle against the interference of the parties.
The Minister for Energy said Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete outburst of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented by the political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course we can look forward to the reaction from PKK, he added.
On Thursday, PKK signed up for one of the most murderous attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
Pretty crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES Winter Department of Technical Services.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES is following an accurate plan.
As it snows throughout Frankfurt, and temperatures fall below zero, they go to 20 so-called A-sections, the big sprinklers, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit moves such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descent like Atzelbergstraße.
FES starts at 3: 00 in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with moist salt, which is better held, about 1040 kilometres within a maximum of three hours.
That's why the FES starts at 3: 00 a.m., "to keep the roads open when the traffic to work starts."
It's not easy when it starts snowing until 7: 30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Department of Technical Services, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers."
It is only when it does not snow so much that access and connection communication, including Rat-Beil-Straße, are in order.
The last priority is side roads and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At 5: 00 in the morning, FES pawns will be on their way, preferably cleaning up dangerous places and transitions.
FES can't usually take care of all bike paths.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that follows from 22 to 4.30 mainly bridges, says Brauburger.
As the iceberg forms quickly on them, the sprinklers come out as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Dinosaur cradle
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: An animal two metres long and 1.50 metres tall ran on two strong back legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short anterior legs with sickle claws and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's edition of Science magazine wrote that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily traits.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He's showing us a lot about kinship, enlargement, and early dinosaur signs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging up Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes on one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is unprecedented for triassic deposits, informing team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the dig, they collected the remains from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This find is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But a lot of the oldest fossils are not complete, which is why the assignment of the pradinosaurs is usually questionable.
For example, experts discuss when lizards were divided into the three most important development lines: carnivorous teropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (birds), such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original terrace after analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found, for example, evidence of air bags that even the offspring of teropods have birds.
Thanks to air bags, bird breathing is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already created by the common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because so far known as the most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists concluded that the lizards were there for the first time.
According to this, three lines of development were divided soon and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time, as the supercontinent Pangea formed a single Earth mass.
The fact that the team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, teropods, along with Tawa hallae would speak for that.
The three of them can't come from one common, migrated ancestor, they argue scientists.
We believe there have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted picture, because very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs have been preserved in South America, and they are rarely found on other continents ever.
As the dinosaurs proved, from a relatively rare by-line of reptiles to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the Middle Ages, it remains a puzzle.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while relatives died out and the interface of the Triassic and the Jurassic.
The history of success didn't last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extinction, which dinosaurs happened to survive, but not reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adjusted, so they could push out the competition.
In any case, the history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the meteor hit helped another group of animals, who also evolved into a triassic and have lived in the shadow of mammals ever since.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Docents from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police cleared the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University took care of the worldwide commotion.
278 professors and teachers at Goeth University, but also universities all over Germany, Europe, and North and South America, are in solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "do not approve" of the presidium-fueled police intervention.
Since the walls and works of art were painted, University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied last week by striking students and speakers.
At the same time, five students were injured.
Damage to the cause, judge by signatories, does not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organised teaching students and teaching police commandos."
Cleansing is an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "improper and criminalise the protest" and diverts attention from the contents.
The presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturer calls for a halt to criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support material damage.
Authorised protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union are also in solidarity with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
In the meantime, Hessen Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is defending the process of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday at the Actuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Assembly.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said a member of the Earth Assembly under the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of SPD, Green and Linke saw it.
CDU takes painted walls for an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there has been a vacancy.
Linke made a proposal calling on the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For years, it has paid for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district of 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from Moscow Center, is considered to be "the Russian Silicon Valley."
Significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
As of September 2008, Green-Grad representatives established contacts with the Frankfurt Scientific Centre Riedberg - the University institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several visits to each other and on Wednesday they signed the "Protocol on close cooperation" in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's Vice-Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, for Frankfurt was signed by Edwin Schwarz's head planning officer.
In 2010, representatives of the FIS and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in science research will go to the seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to get caught up in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want to get orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaya Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation of the "Green City") has acquired its name according to the wooded hilly landscape in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart Brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 is not enough to prepare.
For the project supporters, this is quite simply a "new heart of Europe."
S21 is more than a train station launch, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate building chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the '80s.
Head stations with tracks that ended in the centre of the city were then considered as transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to fold the locomotives from the back forward.
Pull over, pull over, move on - that's how it should work.
And that's why the main stations are disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passageway station, which lies roughly halfway across the trans-European railway bridge route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan about "the heart of Europe."
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980's are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves knew that in the Hessen and Bavarian cities, the start of the construction was almost unfinanciable.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with driving and driving.
Still: Starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
Earth and municipal politicians put it in place.
Routes work together, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistically, there is still some way to excuse the project.
There will be a new urban space, which - if we trust computer pictures of designers - will contain many greenery.
The S21 is harmful to the railway transport system.
The railway station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which, typically in the 1980s, was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights at the time.
However, modern transport policy must be primarily about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climb.
More importantly, the S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good EUR 6 billion was to be buried in Switzerland.
That's an official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade, funding will be lacking for further node points and narrow points in the network.
There are sixty bigger projects on the Ministry of Transport list.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been building on this route at a slow pace.
You need to push hard in here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley line will become the throat of a bottle of international freight traffic: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment regarding the airport
The Land Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Assembly if it goes against the judgment of the Hessen Court of Justice (VGH) on the ban on night flights and has it revised.
The CDU / FDP coalition authorised experts to legally assess more than a 400-page VGH judgment, said the Minister for Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today justified in writing that the State would have to re-regulate the night flight ban in case of construction of the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt airport.
The permission of 17 flights between 23: 00 and 5: 00, as envisaged by the Land Government, does not correspond to the legally ordered protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether to request a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this postponement and came to the government's representatives to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel group called on CDU and FDP to return to the promises to ban the night flights it had made before the election. Otherwise, this can be regarded as a "violation of the word."
It's damn hard, if you can keep your word, said Green Tarek's boss Al-Wazir in a reference to the FDP election slogan "We hold the word."
Minister Posch rejected the complaint of Schäfer-Gümbel, the Earth government is trying to get to its night flights by "twisting law and tricks."
Accurate legal control takes its time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of "quick first impressions."
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statements to ban night flights have never been as the opposition has given them.
The American banks are paying off the aid
American, crisis-shocked big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
At the same time, the Bank of America paid back $45 billion (around EUR 30 billion) of assistance from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
So they want to get rid of the restrictions that have been made by accepting money - the restrictions on paying bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has provided investors with $19 billion of net money thanks to convertible bonds.
She took the rest from her cash register, which was filled with, among other things, union sales.
On Wednesday night, the head of Kenneth Lewis specifically thanked the US taxpayer: a cash injection helped us through a difficult time.
At the top of the financial crisis, the cash institution has damaged itself by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the State by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC reported with reference to sources that this US bank could have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman wouldn't comment on that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid off.
Quick Choice
It went faster than expected.
The station presented its successor just two weeks after the ZDF board pushed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the grammium wanted to make a deal with that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital of Berlin, was the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially, so it wouldn't get ahead of the process.
The role, however, could also have been that they did not want to harm the ZDF, Markus Schächter, if this proposal had not been passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Gremia.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline for this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
In fact, the Union majority on the board indicated a few weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor was organized by Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of a highly esteemed editor by arguing that the ZDF news coverage quotas had fallen under Brender.
So, until shortly before the election, protests were strongly criticised by the political influence on the ZDF.
For the last time, 35 state-law lawyers joined the debate, who considered Koch's procedure unconstitutional.
It was no use.
About a person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romantics.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey went to ZDF, first to "heute-journal."
Next station: 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the editor-in-chief; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 manager and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main studio of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the expert periodical Medium Magazine journalist of the year, was deposed, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional suit.
Koch's counter-candidate on the board of directors, the Rhine-falcon Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the Länder should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the intensive personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's anticipated successor, Peter Frey, gave the board the heads of the board a clever chess move - he criticized the grammium for it immediately after he was deposed.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him as editor without losing his face, and he could be elected by the board of directors without being suspected of being pushed into office by the party.
In partisan arithmetic, Frey is also one of the left-wing liberals.
Study gets rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strike, Ministers of Culture finally went to the Länder on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Rectors, the two parties agreed that there was a will to improve the conditions of study for Bachelors and Masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the load by testing: In principle, each study module should end with one single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be checked and the "real and defensible measure 'should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create a more flexible common structural assignment for Bachelor's and Master's studies.
Earth deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the beginning of student protests in the worm, the ministers of culture and university rectors in the mouth have had winged words about a better study.
Now, for the first time, they're filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided that the number of examinations will be partially drastically reduced: "Each module will normally be completed only once," it is written in a 30-page report, which is intended in part to regulate the approval of studies.
"A significantly lower test burden," said the Chairman of the Reinhold Grimm Accreditation Board, "a false development is to be stopped, which significantly reduced the complexity of the study."
To do this, the "complexity of study" in the future is to be a "decisive criterion" in implementation.
Modules and content "must be checked hard" so that "do not unduly restrict students in choice
seminars'.
Students should "be entitled to an area that allows and supports their own initiative."
The rules are to apply in the approval of new fields of study, after examination but also for existing fields of study.
These need to be "re-accredited" every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 to recheck all fields of study.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation councils established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the Länder "strongly" to act on the agencies in such a way that the content of the teaching was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the regional ministries on appropriate measures.
As a single country, Rhineland-Palatinate has promised additional funds for further development of the Bologna Process.
In particular, universities should pay for consultation programmes and study advice from money, and strengthen test and foreign authorities.
For this, countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to put an amendment to the higher education law in Parliament.
According to it, only one single test should be required for the completion of the study module.
The form of study should be even more flexible, with the recognition of examinations from other universities being guaranteed and the availability of a master's degree being facilitated.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all the fields of study in the country should be rechecked.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition were again arguing about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups, Juso, called for the development of education policy not to take place in the future 'behind closed doors' of ministers and university rectors.
No later than after the strike, students as concerned should "at least say a word."
Future academics also received support from the President of the University Rector Conference (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need student experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Education and Science Department (GEW), Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: they demand a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a Bachelor's degree to have access to undergraduate master's degree.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that, for today's generation of bachelor students, there are plenty of seats available tomorrow in the master's study fields with the best conditions, said the board member GEW Andreas Keller.
The Länder must employ far more speakers.
But the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to Master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
To get to Germany and out is nice, almost no control... "is the introductory line of one poem by poet Werner Söllner, who in this plucked-out language piece is a theme of the experience of the arrival of a dissident who has won his freedom, but has also lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house, 1982 he then moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt University of Goethe, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessen Forum of Literature in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
He took care of the considerable extraliterary commotion last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where it was a "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security act."
Apparently, the uncertain and stunned Söllner has left a statement in which Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, confess to their cooperation as a secret informant for the Romanian Secret Service Secure.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language prize in 1989.
They say the recruitment attempts began in 1971.
I am, continued by Söllner, "someone who did not resist enough attempts at intimidation by Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of the dictatorship government, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and infamy of the political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said by the current state of knowledge, just the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a role in the Securitate acts, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and referred to a positive influence on himself as Secret Agent Walter.
"Hitting" me out at all the important points for him back then, says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was in this form, and in front of this audience, the unexpected, but completely surprising, confession of a former dissident, and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own acts, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for spies Secure.
The people concerned may be expected to speculate and, in some cases, probably know which name is behind the cover name Sorin, Voic and Walter as well.
Other than at home, in the meantime a very certain view of the Stazi components, the handling of the survivor of the Secure check is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and restricted.
One of Birthler's offices, which is responsible for the National Council for the Processing of Securitate (CNSAS) components, was founded only in 1999, the act has been issued rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of ingredients.
The fact that former Securitate members still have a major influence in Romania, after the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller was published, he demonstrated one conversation in which one of the former Securitate bosses from Timisoara spoke out of the possession of the award.
She says she has psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The humiliation of power has been expressed here completely unobscured in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as in the case of Söllner, as in the case of a closed crime, the inevitable questions are connected.
Why now? Who is hurt? A special response of the listeners to Söllner's confession is expected to determine the continuation of this chapter rather than the desire for knowledge.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saved Deposit Champions League
It looked like a clean-dressed sales rep from a cute Christmas party, at which the sports goods manufacturer handed out candy when he boarded a quarter of an hour after midnight to a class C Mercedes called in, the new coach, VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-coloured pouch sponsor. "
A man with a fancy bald hair let a strange city drive after him because of him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in play, and drunk with happiness was a 55-year-old man also little.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work will continue.
Or it's just getting started.
In the words of only three days engaged Switzerland: "We have reached the eight finals," because of the heat 3: 1 above Unirea Urzimen from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally tough fight against descent."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mohuchi the performance of the royal class even on a simple league day.
And to avoid again obvious weaknesses after three rapid Marica goals (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11.).
Loading
The eight finals of the Champions League (match 16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / retaliation match 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's startling successor will therefore be preserved.
Not only with an alleged healer who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, commitment and joy in the short term.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the soul healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, in the action of therapist Babbel, did not prove any more effective.
He cheered up a certain magic, admitted Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you don't think are possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after several weeks of intermission caused by injury, became the best player on the field because of his dynamism, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" by proverbial "fresh wind" and working procedures of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
It was obviously missing Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, even players and managers do not want to overestimate victory against a weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of a Romanian guest.
They would have won even in Glasgow before there was a nasty wake-up call after 0: 4 in Leverkusen, considering Khedira.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal was achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not out of the woods yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first home victory after three months was caused by weekend events that had recently come to life in the form of a television interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions made by others and not by Jens, Heldt responded to the harsh criticism of Lehman.
He presented weak leadership to the board and decided to change the coach after the pressure of teenage fans.
Even that he was cancelled his free day after the matches, Lehmann marked as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehman's statements "formulate pure egoism," answered Heldt and announced the consequences for goaltenders.
I don't think both 40-year-olds are going to have any more joy in life.
Anyway, they think it's one with the others that without the work of a deposed coach team, it wouldn't be possible for a player to have such a strong and fighting performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "big share of success," they say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
Heavyweight Championship
The passionate duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitali Klitček.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title to the WBC boxing organization.
The verdict of the referees was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitchko remains world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko, this is the third successful defence of the title after his return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukraine was twice World Champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the K.O. everyone was expecting.
Klitschko improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional duels, he was defeated twice because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th duel.
In front of some 17.000 spectators in the Berlin arena, Klitschko drove the fight mainly with his left hand.
But 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, withdrew before the World Champion, so Klitschko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
All in all, passive Johnson did a lot to the challenger and he was just trying to get into the next round.
The handle may have provoked the words and gestures, but the world champion has rarely been hit.
But still, he's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought a full 12 rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger took care of the uproar in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a "disgusting zombie," who "can't do anything right."
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled the sunglasses off Johnson's nose so he could see his eyes.
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitchko remained undefeated even after the fourth duel after his return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year break in Berlin, Nigerian beat Samuel Peter and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight before.
In this year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreol from the United States.
In this fight, I only got one shot, and physically in good shape, justified Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the World Champion of WBO and IBF organizations.
But the WBA's belt is worn by British David Haye, after he dropped 2,13 meters of high Nikolai Vulayev off the throne in November.
Haye dropped the fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
Supposedly, his promoter company is planning a fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
The head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction called the Minister of Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of bad information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Linke (Left) call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz raid, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed conscious deception.
The Minister for the Deadly Bombing of Two Tanks in September said "consciously untrue," said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction on Saturday's news show ARD "Tagesschau."
Let's call it the usual term: "He lied."
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
It became clear on Friday that the attack was not only about the destruction of hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US raid requested by German commander Kunduz, Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to NATO's investigation.
On Saturday, the Greens, SPD and Linke invited Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Federal Assembly and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan Federal Assembly policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and a colleague from the Greens Renate Künast called for it.
A spokesman for Ulrich Wilhelm's government has definitely refused criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no bearing on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the Ministry's assessment of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg were informed correctly and completely about the background of the tank attack.
Officially, it was said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the Minister.
However, it has been said from around the two top officials that the Ministry of Defence has even drawn attention to several reports, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and one report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in the meantime in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any reply yet.
The Ministry did not comment on the complaints on Saturday and pointed out that this will be dealt with in the Committee of Investigation of the Federal Assembly, which will be set up next Wednesday.
World of Dreams
Some see images in their waking state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only psychologically ill or intoxicated, they blend the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and fantasy delusions.
But those who, in their waking dreams, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, pay in today's Western world mostly for a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in psychologically ill patients or in drug intoxication.
The guilt has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, make sure that every now and then they blend the boundaries between dreams, imagination and reality.
Dreams of altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in a better case we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experience of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shaman states of delirium, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain is derailed - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Comprehensive hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has employed philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as the form of a dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "the great similarity of delirium with dreaming states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusion of senses."
It's autumn of 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and blatantly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, floating at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, winged devil figures with bloody red grimases, valuing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery shoes, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over the body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the voices they call him and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, tie them in a loop and attach it to the hook on the ceiling.
He steps on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn, they're screaming at the choir's voices, tearing his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get treatment!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was triggered.
His diagnosis is schizophretic paranoid psychosis, besides being manic-depressive, taking anti-depression medications, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
Pah-wraiths are a terrible fact.
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lives, it's the second most commonly treated disease in psychiatric clinics after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disability cannot usually distinguish between the inner and outer world anymore, and they are in a state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
A hearing of voices is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or lead dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The disabled is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out the disruptive signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as the dream opens the psychosis of the floodgates of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Physician of the General Psychiatric Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenik is located in the center of events, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, it comes into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics, therefore, often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
The comparison with reality is not usually possible with them, the phantoms are a terrible fact, the awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime, experience hallucinations
Other than in a dream, Fuchss says, "But the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusion and hallucinations are based on reality, alienating experience takes place in a real context.
The scientist is still facing a riddle as to why exactly our brains are doing this kind of brainstorming.
Exceptional states can lead to everyone losing touch with reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early stage of development will damage the neural maturation of the brain, such as a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a riddle as to how the neural system will fail, which has not shown itself in any way for years.
Role also plays the effects of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if it is available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
♪ When our brains are in a jam ♪
The crazy thing is that psychopaths suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medics, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Casten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf."
The hallucination is one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also one of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma are also often common.
Surprisingly hallucinating under certain conditions even the brain of a healthy person.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of content of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They occur when parts of the brain where sensory perception is processed are too active or too little suppressed; if our brain is clogged, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, love worries, or other extraordinary states.
In more recent studies, up to a third of the people questioned reported that at least once in their lives they had experienced hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to the gymnasium there.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the patterns and the voices.
At breaks, she can be approached by a cologne with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with a surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This timid girl is considered an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, he knows that.
He's awake, he hears and he sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy, he sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are rather depressing.
Often delusions are a burden.
When she sits in a classroom, she cannot watch the teaching many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the table of mathematical equations.
At night, the appearance is rather daunting.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, she often can't tell whether she's awake or asleep, whether the images she sees are grimace, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and legs are formed before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009, Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Delusions are also the art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated, or if stimuli are taken away, they will most likely hallucinate, says Kasten.
I guess the brain doesn't have enough work to take care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at 13 that the man she called Dad since she thought herself wasn't her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas are active, which also process real sensations and sounds, it is hard for the disabled as Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality from each other. "Every experience," says Casten, "takes place in the brain, also reality is displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to develop, so they seem so real. "
Also, night dreams evaluate kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenic people, psychologically healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises his patients to treat hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border status between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world concentrated too much in mind, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at Florence-Nightingale Hospital Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinic in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, bitter disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard was exploring the so-called one-iroid form of experience, a strange form of altered consciousness for a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person considers to be real and cannot distinguish them back from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis when fully conscious.
When a man is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, such as a permanent, complete inability to move, replaces a life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
The kind of borderline between a dream and a hallucination.
Because it is impossible to handle a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will be present in the picture.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory transfer in some unbearable situation that allows us people our own ability to form, to move on to the loss of consciousness in an instant.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a life-saving event of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, following heart valve surgery followed by heart transplants, his consciousness began to travel for several days, while his body lay still in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he created, visited strange times and places: He becomes an old man bedridden, in a train sanatorium, the robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles who make intoxicants out of blood.
On a motorcycle, the Greek takes him to his country, surfs in a hospital bed on a company in the Alps, and meets a Korean mobster.
They immerse themselves completely in imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner roads are fundamentally different from any dream for Claussen.
The dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental journeys are still clear after years and in insignificant detail.
Even brighter and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show the neoiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug intoxication, how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be rewarding.
Snow may come
Burda
They're supposed to take over the publishing house at 27.
The new head of the publishing house Kallen is a temporary solution: In the long term Hubert Burd wants to hand over his business to his children, he told SPIEGEL.
Holding is supposed to belong to a 100% family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at 27 and have the firm will to enter the business, says 69-year-old man of SPIEGEL.
We've dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is not considered until later.
And the question is, do they have the skills to do that?
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in charge of their children if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he had withdrawn from the chair of the Board of Directors since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of Burda's board since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury section added responsibility for the company's assets and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also Direct Marketing, Foreign Affairs, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are leading the publishing house.
Burda's kids are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years" by Burdo.
Holding should still belong to a 100% family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses had no certainty before their demise: "This has always affected companies that have been infected by the desire for capital, which they speculated and thought could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political precursor of this country, such as Springer, and I do not want to play world league with "Time," these deals are too big.
Complex care of beauty
Everything you can wish for in the area of beauty and well-being is within your reach.
This was decided by El Corte Inglés, which has just started the operation of the Callao (Madrid) shopping centre with an area of more than 1000 m2, in which various services are provided in the field of body care.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor where there are prestigious companies such as Hedonai dealing with laser depilation-; Spaxión, spaces for relaxation and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with gym or L'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and more.
There is also a nutrition department and especially a tea house offering more than 130 different kinds of tea.
You and your partner can enjoy relaxing massages while enjoying the view of the capital, rent a relaxation zone for two hours and arrange your own 'beauty party' in the company of up to eight friends, relax in a hot tub, have a massage and a glass of champagne, which are some of the variants of Spaxion.
It is a total of 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons in which the above services are provided, as well as the most modern treatments for facial care, body and also hydrotherapy.
As an example, we can give a cavitation that is used in the fight against cellulite or vibration platforms.
The gym is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual coaches, who guard individual actions of clients and thus provide completely individual care.
It all starts by putting a personal key into the contact screen that is placed against the machine.
Then you can watch video samples that show you the correct implementation of our training routine.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) is sufficient to exercise all muscles.
And if after the exercise we want to go to the hairdresser, Luis & Tachi has space where individual procedures are performed to heal hair, improve their shine and nutrition.
Innovation and excellence are the presiding of this city wellness centre, which is open every day from 10: 00 to 10: 00.
Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and that's when it's appropriate to find out what celebrities wear and adapt their ceremonial wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which must be noted.
We are making a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend it.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric motor
Endesa, along with Barcelona City Hall, founded 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
LIVE '(Logistics on the implementation of electric vehicles) will set up and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure mobility agreements, manage, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop MOVELE projects, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the purpose is to support this means of transport in the future.
3 'Electric Towns'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
These are three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the deployment of electric vehicles.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan Government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activity and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa with regard to the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a "rest period" for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero expects the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, to be "resting time."
In the Prime Minister's 2009 economic report, Zapatero summarised the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competition Plan for the Automotive Industry, we would now have a state of abandonment, the closure of some of our main production companies," said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected in the future for this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Internal Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), had set 800 million for projects of 19 producers and 137 auxiliary companies that had mobilised an investment in excess of EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed government support measures and mentioned Plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan enabled a reduction of 6% of the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a "significant increase 'in the minutes, namely in November by" 40%'.
20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid will be opened the first international salon of classic vehicles, which is a place for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20 000 square metres, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all types related to the engine world.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies will be the following: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renewal of cars; or Cocher Clásicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Exterior competence tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: the holding of concentration, sports performances, audiences, presentations and auditions.
Also, aptitude tests will be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazd3 i-Stop: conservation of sports style
Mazda intends to show that friendliness towards the surrounding environment has no negative effect on the sport style.
That is why Mazd3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as i-Stop-, a device that is currently only available with a petrol engine of 2.0 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazd3 is characterised by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface finish, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent with Mazd3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely fine.
Using the tool and console assembly, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that is also presented by Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazd3 and Civic, both Japanese, are in conflict with the sobriety of German products and more specifically with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish to ride very comfortable.
In addition, a large luggage compartment and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system is available only with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-stage hand gearbox.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very delicate, characterized by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazd3 is in the version of diesel, all those who do not drive so many kilometres a year should not exclude this i-stop with a petrol engine, because it is characterized by greater comfort during driving and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the lane monitoring system (RVM) which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of thrust and stability, speed control, interior mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, for a surcharge of 1,500 euros: adaptable lights two-xenon and sound system BOSE with CD holder, among other parts.
Conclusion
Mazd3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is characterised mainly by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more kilometres per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with petrol motor lines2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is €21.770 for Luxury and €23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price Mazd3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the 'Nine' brand. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, serves only for viewing mail, without the possibility of viewing certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine appreciated him as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see him out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by very low prices and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for, for example, an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started to offer two new devices: one for Twitter alone, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but for which Peek has to be paid six times the amount.
FonPeek, who was introduced to Le Web last night, is a European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is about EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or to look eagerly for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) so that they can see the mail.
The idea of a fixed price rooming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device such as FonPeek (interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering download of books and further search on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable when purchased, not after months.
And that is exactly what I expect to happen in the FonPeek case, is the possibility of buying with a lasting approach like Peek already has in place in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the consumer's point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The color that loves Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
To join Barack Obama as President of the United States, she chose the same suit and coat in this color, which she also chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the delivery of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to the fact that it is a similar colour - yellow and green with glitter effects - in both cases it was a three-piece ensemble - dress, bag and coat made of the same cloth - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of Michelle's appointment, she used a large lace, printed in Oslo velvet.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium high heel, now similar model, but in gold color.
They also wear different hairstyles: this short hair, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternal-related work problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and the career of Spanish women' carried out by the CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities due to maternity.
The study underlines that at the beginning of cohabitation there are many differences in opinion of the number of children depending on whether they are working or not and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work away from home, work part-time or have a stable job, start living with their partner sooner, give birth to their first child and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, cohabitation and motherhood are postponed, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted a greater part of their life to achieving their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the time of starting coexistence with the partner, "explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of the offspring is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in an age group of 35 to 49 years, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education get married and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with middle or high education go the other way and prefer to have a stable job, before marriage and the birth of their first child, "Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I am worth it'.
'Joyeux Noël ', one of the most elegant international actresses, is thus added to the next famous personality of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before that, Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Shack') joined this select club.
The men's part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, before and now - gathered for the annual award ceremony that took place in London, at the Royal Court of the os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicenta
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of writers he has encountered in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life) in 'Ace Poker' (Alfaguara, an illustration of Fernando Vicente).
It does not do this in feared and predictable genres (biographic similarities, life and work), but it seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent does not conserve relief or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even at repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of opposites, the morality of guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been driven by passion to this woman for 13 years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey published in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8,000 vertices in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which often the best climbers fall down."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
By himself, he said he was the heir to the county landowner, another time he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, these were great dreams. "
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured on the bridge the deranged cry of this man from Munich to bring his echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running from himself and calling for the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "She once kneeled down and prayed, 'Oh, my God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.'"
Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verses were engraved on his grave: 'After the effort comes a dream,' after the storm a calm harbor, 'after the war rest,' after a full life death. '
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also carried his depression.
My husband completely agreed to tell him that Eduard VII followed her between azaleas or that the birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly. "
About Pío Baroja: "What else was it about Martin Santos but targeting Joyce on the Baroja?
What else was it to Benet but have Baroja executed with Faulkner's gun?
What else did Cel want but to make himself famous at the expense of that man's glory? "
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother went through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 went through the college and our dog, a hybrid rescued from a shelter of a maximum weight of six kilograms, kicked him twice and injured him hard without a word.
Our outrage is all the more so that we see nothing fun in such aggression towards a small and defenceless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after the incident, when she took a walk with these individuals, she began to fear for her own safety, for such a devil-obsessed man who attacks an animal, is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at 5: 00 in the afternoon, Tuesday, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was of any use and, in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
The outrage has driven us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people these days when they're having fun worrying about a defenseless animal that gives us love, society, and friendship.
We don't understand where the right manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in cooperation with the Fesvial, launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both were informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to stress the importance of the use of the helmet, as it is the only means of avoiding head injury or death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their transport safety obligations, which "means more than designing and producing even safer products', and has confirmed that it seeks to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. by means of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of a helmet when riding a motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', is the first stage in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be placed in a display to get to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety "is a constant problem 'for this company, which is a tyre manufacturer for two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is starting to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of Anfac producers and Ganvam vendors.
However, a favourable figure is better placed in quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and has resulted in a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling under the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks / bogies.
And even the gridlock that is most damaging to demand, even when bought by private individuals, the majority of purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and almost 100% of the cases involve funding through third parties.
Other factors, such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation, need to be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the bank loan source.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, supporting the purchase of 2000E did not help very much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention persons engaged in a business licence of small and medium-sized companies who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded again that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sales association foresees that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the calculations the sales of passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The handbrake auxiliary system is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, even with ESP stability control, auxiliary manual brake systems, all of this will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others the deadline for the removal of the deficiency is set, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, while operating in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary manual brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which will be detected by the system after the driver has stepped on it.
But he can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by Bosch car parts manufacturer, a third of the drivers who are in an accident did not press the brake before the collision and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum possible from the braking system, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year related to pedestrians could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more notable - according to calculations would prevent one of the four accidents affecting persons - after the introduction of so-called intelligent manual brake systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that captures obstacles (using radar or camera) and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will apply as intensely as possible to the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors Postpones Plan for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably on 8th April - as Javier Ortega informed, the US manufacturer points out that it will need more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan to be agreed with the party concerned first.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued with delay at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in those days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on US producers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows for contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of a Dutch sport car manufacturer, Skyper, operating under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement could be reached with any of them, GM could sell certain assets to Saab to Baic.
The decision to close the Saab will continue to apply if its sale fails.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, thus the weight shows only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of this, the automatic drawdown roof is in canvas with manual control, reducing weight by 21 kg; also aluminium doors such as GT3 were used, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction of weight by another 7 kg; after installation of sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to a relaxed 19-inch rotation of another five kg.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing door handles with textile grips means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-clutch gearbox PDK, one vehicle with a hand-lined six-stage speed box was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many complex turns.
His behavior can only be classified as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed to the asphalt.
On the contrary: we have not tested such a small and light model for a long time, which would also transmit such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete able to warm his muscles while driving for a short time until we order him to sprint, brake, and restore engine use...
Whatever we want, because of the steering, which is as communicative as it is accurate, whatever we point out with our hands on the steering wheel, is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound according to clearance
The sound of V6 boxers, of 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be amplified by the possibility of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used by the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether when sucking or recuperating.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road asphalt we drive with Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary while driving; in some corners, we hit ice and gravel at dawn even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the funniest on the market, as it is something more than just a Boxster S modification.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at EUR 70.831.
"Bag Girl"
Girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon series and occasional starlette at the "company" shows, the singer shows her face to an evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel purses.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's' Bag Girl '.
Baskonia has won a victory in Israel
She won a brilliant victory in 82-91 in her host on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice cooperative, and thus she became the leader of her group after a large performance by Mirzy Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the cooperative (29 reviews).
The Vitoria Cooperative was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micah with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end in order to win.
In addition, the high precision of the 16 triple points circuit was a major part of the final triumph.
The match began with a front for the blue team, who stood on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, which indicated that they had attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alaskan cooperative decided to play an internal game of Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, which was accepted by whistling and applause when returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovice was already beginning to be the best in his team with 13 points, although 'with no six' in Split's rating already indicated that it would not be the best evening for Brazilians.
But although the game was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Macabeans wanted to remind Vitoria that everyone on their field did not win, and 'by the hand of Elias' managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to bringing 'yellow' back to the sun (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to take their breath, and in that time appeared the machine gun Mirza Teletovic, who had three triples almost in succession and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a soothing count (54-67), which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaevites have done their last part of the skin, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow them to be deprived of the results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter voted out as a foul seevanova, they did not rush and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaj to fight.
Unicaja lost significantly to Olympiacos in Greece and left it to the leadership of Group B in Euroliza in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga Cooperative was not afraid of the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, or of a rival, perhaps one of the more ill in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, lit up the playground with 12-18, a minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned a score of 22-20, a minute 13, which was the moment when the fight between the Oporas of USABeverley and Williams meant the elimination of both players.
The Greek cooperative began to work and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English beer because of Joel Freeland's injury and the three personal mistakes made by Carlos Jiménez was burdened by Unicaja
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very offensive by Olympiacos, which, despite losing by 19, proved superior and even managed to offset the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, a minute 27, which shook the leadership in the group.
Unicaya tried to overcome the absence and last absence of a Scottish beer named Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicajo thanks to the leadership and triple points of Cook and the contribution of Lewis, she left a certain hope of a win of 66-57, a minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and superiority in centimeters in his zone, proved that he was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to balance basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicja withered and handed over the lead Olympiacos.
How much should you collect for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can learn about the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, search engine with the largest number of classified advertisements from real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
How much should you take? calculates user salaries based on more than 140 000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain using the form available on Facebook, where you need to insert a profession, years of experience, age and city where you wish to work.
During the week the application works, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally "feels badly rewarded," explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from his search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes EUR 45.226 gross per year and EUR 31.059 in France, while the Spaniard receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver is paid EUR 34.247 a year net in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is a waiter with 11.592 euros a year; followed by a salesman with 14.725 euros and a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil set the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010 when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras capital, has confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy where he has been hiding since 21 September.
"He is aware that, on 27 January, after the end of his mandate, he must leave to seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by phone.
After the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
In the end, the operation failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that the government "de facto" was trying to impose on him, presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty emerged again in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment in which managers take decisions on a future that is uncertain in itself.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was a debt redemption by direct asset purchases and an indirect liquidity release at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually ended, and without calling into question their conflicting liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a bit of sand into the gills, as the Bank of Spain did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in a return to reducing risk revenues.
The volatility of the stock exchange and the differences in corporate bonds have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risk, which again affected government debt.
They are pushing for quality again, and the US, Japan, and Germany have become the refuge of the chosen investors, thereby widening the differentiation of euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the decline in the Spanish Kingdom's qualifications.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useful for silencing moral hazard advocates who have once again tried to burden the conscience of the people responsible for world economic policy with a view to preventing the devastating consequences of reducing credit to employment, when, in fact, it would be necessary to declare a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the emirates' recovery and, as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers up the deficit, elections, and the new government is coming in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from failing to make foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to make it possible for the euro Member State to fail to fulfil its obligations.
But what makes sense is that Ecofin forces the Greek Government to transparency and to commit its own citizens to joint responsibility when emergency measures are needed to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalisation of the transitional risk premium, after some excesses in the supported positions would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase in the same way as European companies' bonds, we do not have to worry.
If European differences fall and ours continue to expand, it would be typically a Spanish risk.
The issue of Standard & Poor's is just anecdotes. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 rise scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to go back to the Japanese scenario, it does not give the Spanish economy much hope to live up to this warning.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now, "be careful, driver friend."

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán first intervened in front of the subcommittee of the House of Deputies yesterday, where Spain's energy strategy is being discussed over the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán provided several comments to the press regarding the proposal he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another EUR 60,000 from that date to 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this had not happened, the necessary investment would not have been 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that over the next decade investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the question has changed and performance will need to be increased.
Its supply focuses on gas and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that a new 18.000 MW is needed, but with other "supporting energies."
Galán, who believes that the draft law on a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with the line requested by the company, did not want to let go of the vein as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, 'a clear long-term bet' is in this sense, despite the 'precise' measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start to take place now, because their maturation persists and a stable tax framework is needed to initiate them.
Ferrovial won 'Handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for airport land services, Swiss Swissport, will play the role of a preferential partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement which has not yet resulted in economic terms is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create a Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which are Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be research into energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona strives for its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the highway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water management company.
The construction in question is an estimated $1,700 million tunnel (about EUR 1,047 million).
Its opponents are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for Acciona to settle in that country as a construction and concession motorway company.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel finished at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP as originally in English) for further development of the project in the business plan of Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of tolls.
Offers are expected to be submitted in May, and the expected investment will reach $1,700 million (€1,047 million), and at the last stage, three companies with a significant presence in European construction are competing.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists on underground buildings.
Against the Acciona Group is the Northern Direct Group with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which passed through the network, has the name LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (subsidiary of the construction company of the German company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a major company specialising in civil constructions of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great construction and privatisation, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry in a way other than the acquisition of a local construction company.
In addition to Asian references, the strategy followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted company Leighton.
Million-dollar assets
Acciona bets on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the desalination business.
Among other assets it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground road subject to tolls, the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link (Northern Connector), is designed to connect the western highway from Toowong with the Kelvin Grove circuit route (see map) of 5 kilometers of tunnel. It is the largest event to reduce the traffic congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar provided for by the local administration is scheduled for summer 2010 and the start of the work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would have opened in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is not planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane already offered this order Hochtief
Australia still brings a significant profit to Hochtief by announcing a contract with a government estimated at 154 million yesterday.
The ACS shares will be operational through its Leighton local filmmaking infrastructure of the national wide-band network with fibre optic cable.
This situation will allow 400,000 people to quickly access the Internet and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the project of King George Tower construction on 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work was just about to start and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, namely Manchester, Laing O'Rourke will participate in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC received an allocation of EUR 64,5 million for a 2.1-kilometer tunnel in Slovenia through its Alpine filipina.
The company obtained a contract a few days after the construction of works to expand the tunnel in Boswuck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in building tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sr. Rushmore got a commercial in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sr. Rushmore for an approximate amount of EUR 3 million per year over the last two years, informing the railway company.
The contract contains the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sr. Rushmore has been selected among 16 agencies that have presented themselves in the Renfe bankruptcy, of which four have passed on to the finals, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sr. Rushmore will be looking after the design and production of campaigns.
Fine 63 million for France Télécom for the braking of competition
The competition regulator in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator reduced competition between fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers at the edge of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still the state company have accumulated more than EUR 560 million of fines since 1994 for placing obstacles on their competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the authority which oversees the competition considered that France Télécom had committed a similar offence to that of the past and that therefore there had been a recurrence.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app shop to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, Orange will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Play in the League Champions brought from the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Barçe
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
Manchester United is the leader of the charter.
Manchester United is the leader of the charter.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has divided EUR 5.362.5 million among 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish), which have participated since the 1992 / 1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he earned for participating, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won three times the prize.
The Catalan contemporary champion and the last winner of the Deceased European Cup in 1992 is the fifth in the classification.
The list is run by Manchester United and the Munich Bayern, two teams, who also charged the most money to participate in the last Champions League.
Even though she lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country that has won the most money through the Champions, even though it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by a complex procedure for distributing the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the institution chaired by Michel Platini is planning to make 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of these funds, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received EUR 3.8 million only for their presence, including an additional EUR 550,000 for each match they participate in.
There is also a bonus for winning (800.000 euros) and a draw (400.000 for each team). The eight finalists get three million each; eight quarter finalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion makes 9 million, while the second finalist makes 5.2 million.
In this way, the club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for victory in the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four assigned seats.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasu offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% of Sos
Yesterday, Nueva Rumaso published details of the offer to buy shares, with which it wants to gain a top place between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasoffers EUR 1,5025 per share, which would be paid in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this deferment of 1% per year.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended trading at EUR 1.85; thus, Nueva Rumaso's offer is 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumaso, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The tender shall be conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would be 611,7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to change the structure of its leadership.
The election of María Luisa Jordan as Head of Internal Audit was announced as an attempt to stay on the fringe of possible offers to buy and compensate for the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazar.
This decision makes it the first woman to hold a high office in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the business continues to be immersed in the legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers.
De facto cannot shred the possibility that in the coming months Sos will discover new transfers of funds
As regards the Salazar credit, former members of the Ildefonso Ortega Council and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) spoke yesterday at the National Court and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the option to exclude Paternina that participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised the exclusion involving Inversora Mer against Federica Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorises this operation because it understands that its conditions are in line with the applicable standards and considers that it is "sufficient 'content to explain the brochure submitted after adjustments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the bid was directed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federica Paternina for a price of EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8,95% of the capital of a company consisting of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbau exchanges.
He further explained that 5.592.778 million shares could not be transferred in any way until a bid was concluded, specifying that the price was set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car valuation
In these days of storms and accidents, not just car service is making money.
Each day thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance claim are towed to a service where the expert must estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance claim is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be long and difficult work.
Calculate manually the repair costs from 20.000 to 30.000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service suppliers and solutions for the estimation of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers in order to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the US Solera Group, is a leading company; 80% of the reviews are carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the sales director of Audatex, 63 producers and importers work in Spain and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing is still growing as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start to work.
This is a very feverish work because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing "is carried out for each model, where it is possible to" divert "individual parts of the tourist cars.
With regard to the massive sale model, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to a minor car, it can take three or four months. Today Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
They exceed 99% of the fleet in circulation.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each one specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than 100 technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are included each month and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this vast stream of information enables businesses to use and provide different products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools to control spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of the car.
The only undertaking with a guide to inform about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain support that professionals in the sector can benefit from.
The company offers ten different instruments, with AudaPlus as the star product, a standard solution for the valuation of actuarial events for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or the paint shop.
This tool is valid according to the application for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
After that, any insurance company that makes thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudavIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came from the assembly line, based on the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows you to disable vehicles with an overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying the tendency, making geodemographic analyses or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have passed the service due to an accident or how many have suffered serious claims over a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company involved in the development of this type of instrument.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions to the assessment of damage, accidents or car maintenance
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and accounted for EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalisation of office installations in Paris began.
Audatex was established in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources 62% of her brother is produced in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The world invoicing of Solera (Audatex, Sidella, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera was on the stock market of $1,000 million, and now its shares are estimated at $2,400 million in total.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an accident.
The operation anticipated the subscription of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to a huge international market.
This service of valuation and purchase and sale is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in sectors such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, spare parts sales and professional vendors, who have to register before operations start.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily advertisements, and about 100 new advertisements are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been disabled cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Wagons with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been disabled, after a preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives the budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, searching for a spare part, creation of the budget of the budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the belief of older professionals who are more or less restrained in the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, of which 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally for use you need a computer with internet connection.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical display of the model appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user may include variables such as the price of the labor force, extra charges or discounts, and then print and pass them to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service oriented and does not include an estimation of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working on making these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics welcome because it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it to display the inside side.
