What will he do? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or Confectioner
The new councilmen of the capital of ČSSD will seem to have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old-fashioned colleagues in the Prague Council and in the council.
The Novátalne.cz daily "tried" members of the new ČSSD board, "as they know the notorious slang that originated in the city hall during the last years when the current coalition partners ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary introduced by Prague's political elite during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly enough, the new councilmen don't really understand the familiar terms.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more of a novice in Prague's politics," he responded to the test of "godfather's" vocabulary councilwoman for the culture of Luke Kaucký.
And although he is a political veteran, so did councilman Karel Březina.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you give me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't generally recognize slang."
From the dictionary, the editorial paper, which was published in June this year in front of the ODS election congress, selected six examples, mainly those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
Socialists should explain the terms "Voldemort," "the largest golf hole in Prague," "go to the confectioner," "bull's neck," "betrayal of the capital" and "plunder."
The three councilmen agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to lead Prague's education in the future - first promised the interview, but later no longer answered the phone.
Councillor Peter Dolinek refused the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I'm not going to judge how civil democrats enjoy themselves."
"I am now discussing how we will understand each other within our programmes," he responded.
As has already been said, Alderman Lukáš Kaucký would not have known in the headline above that there was talk of an influential businessman and friend of ex-Mayor Bém Romano Janoušek.
"Voldemort" tells him nothing, and the only term he has correctly estimated in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague."
"This is the Blanca Tunnel," says Kaucký, and immediately says, "But I know that from the newspaper."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
As a Blanka tunnel, the management decrypt not only the matador Karel Březina, but also the environmental councilwoman Luke Shy.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Pachém is familiar with where to find this character - he suspects the meaning of the term "going to the confectionery."
"I think that means going to some Prague business," is Shy close to deciphering that it's the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In line with Březina, he recalls that knowledge was drawn from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test frequencies, there is no similar old-fashioned vocabulary of slang expressions.
"I've consulted colleagues, too, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves more names, sometimes abbreviations and skilful names are used," says the chairman of Prague's ČSSD Petr Hulínský, whose party members call him Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if they call me colleagues," admits to their own nickname Karel Březina.
The News Diary has tried and worked.
Councilman Weinert is for party Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, representative of Miroslav Poche, who, before the election, alerted himself to fraud during party sponsorship, has a nickname for some colleagues "Igraček."
Aliases are also the only thing that social democrats admit in domestic language.
The Hulinskaya is not happy to hear the Hulda, but the News News has also recorded another nickname for this Prague President.
"Doctor of the Law of the Bears" is said to recall that Petr Hulinský won his title as JUDr at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches," published a brochure
Women declared by Burkina Faso as witches have several common characters.
They are more of an older generation, they cannot engage in work for health reasons, for example, they are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation to avoid endangering the rest of the village.
"Men rarely make it to this fate."
"Even young healthy women are not moved away because they help work and give birth to children," described the order nurse, who in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso takes care of more than a hundred women in a special house who have expelled their community from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against unusual "social measures."
She published an information brochure that should help reduce the witch hunt.
There's a catch.
"Over 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso can't read," he pointed out the disadvantage of written education in Die Standard.
Charges of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which is next door to Burkina Faso, a 70-year-old Amma Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured kerosene on her and set her on fire.
He informed the BBC server about the case.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, a woman's oil was ignited, which is used for ritual anointing.
They say he burned after the group wanted to "banish the evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human Soul Eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the witch hunt tried to soften the government, in Gambia, the president himself took part in it last year.
"Gambi President Jammi, after his aunt's death, launched an extensive witch hunt, which was supposed to contribute to her death and try to kill the president himself with black magic."
"He invited Shamans from close Guinea, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and personal security officers of the President, forced randomly selected men and women from Gambia villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
At the farm, trapped people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't make it to the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakal's tenant: Drowning in the stove, higher rent signed
The older man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Apartments "hydrobararona" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it new lease contracts for three apartments: his daughter, and his son, who is in the execution of the sentence.
All three have just been deregulated by rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for apartment 2 + 1 of the second category from next year.
"And it's not hot water and it has to be drowned with petro (solid fuel stove, note)," shows the man with his finger in his son's new contract, whose signature he has the power of attorney.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which was designated by the new lease terms as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until 7 December when they publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man's just waving his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a major laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, there is a large majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, it was decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPGs' waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and is full at 9: 00 a.m. on Tuesday.
There's a security guard from the security agency next to the door with a call-in device.
"Rent 2011," a special button on his touch screen lights up.
One tap and a number note comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your numbers are already beeping on the big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
It's your turn in half a second.
After a while, the old married couple comes to ask about the rent, but apparently the rush in the waiting room does not concern the new rent at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and so on.
Letters with new lease contracts are received in the mailboxes in Ostrava by tenants of most of the 44,000 RPGs portfolio flats around mid-November.
RPG Apartments suggest a 15-38% increase in rent in their letters.
A special partition for new rents was opened at the client center on November 18.
"It's been running for over a week, so it's only on the run," the workers behind the counter say after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local subject of frenzy.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament and the Ostrava native Lubomír Zaoralek of ČSSD took hold of him quite politely, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't changed my toilet record," said the man.
The most according to the workers, the pensioners are coming to see if they will get a discount on rent if they sign in time, as RPGs promise them in a special offer.
Half a discount on February rent will also be paid to other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
The miners' "deregulation" counter, however, is definitely not overflowing with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients there were only about 40 to 50 people because of the 2011 lease," they estimate workers behind the counter.
RPG proposes individual contract negotiation where necessary on the web and its boards.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It is not about threats, but about information about only possible and completely legitimate legal action," points out RPG on its website.
"No one's gonna sue here," says one of the RPG Bytes' workers, and the man on the street outside the client center is partly telling her the truth.
"I have 13,000 pensions, and I have five grand left to eat, and I don't have what it takes to sue," he says.
But the workers will be uneasy.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so I guess people are waiting," he thinks.
The rent regulation ends in most Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byta their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byta, that the just angry tenant accused of malpractice of the housing fund, according to the owners, is the main reason for the increase in rents.
While RPGs from rents could have invested four billion in flats in five years between 2005 and 2010, for four years from 2011 to 2014 it is to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the miners' waiting room repeats several red highlighted information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 flats, that is more than 90% of RPG flats. '
"And it will always be at most 7.50 CZK per square metre and a month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will be rented by 38 percent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," points out RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Apartments promise that deregulation will not drive away leases in the jump, but will be broken down into four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) will be put back into the apartments, mainly in the heat savings - new windows and warm-up.
The priority is to be given to people who sign a lease-increase agreement.
The offices include kindergarten, architects understood
The Avriopoint administration building in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Designer.
No one would expect to hide a mini-nursery with everything that comes with it - coloured walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys, and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Designer employees can visit it.
The design-architectural company Arch.Design, from which studios came a number of important Brno buildings, has been counting on the space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of Babyboom, and it cared about women designers and architects being able to get back to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of shortened time, the kindergarten is a benefit offered by Arch.Design to its employees under the social programme.
Thus, builders and architects can combine demanding jobs with childcare.
The mini-school was invented by Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of management they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (grant of CZK 2.8m) they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operation for two years.
After the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design has an obligation to operate a mini-kindergarten at its own expense for 3 years.
It took one year to prepare the project, and Economy Rating helped significantly with the subsidy application.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the nurse and the teacher of the school take care of the children all day, so children can go to the school without age restrictions, yet they are mostly older than 3 years of age.
Since this is a "mini-school," only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more children can be replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of standing in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-kindergarten is comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation to school benches, and English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their children at any time, and stress situations with delayed picking up children from nurseries away from their parents' workplaces fall out.
So parents use working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal relationship between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design has thus joined Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, the house earned its organic shape by calling it the House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, shards and mosaics, facade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all typical of Antoni Gaudí's Art Nouveau.
The front of the house starts with dream lines, soft colors and texture resembling nature and animals.
You can see the geometry, the rhythm, and the precise order of thought.
At night the whole facade of houses sounds even more dramatic, it is lit so that the impression of the gloss of colors is even more enhanced.
The guilt and twisting of shapes also occurs in the interior.
The wood in the waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, pegs and bars.
The house Batlló, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the house from the architect Emilio Sal Cortes in 1877.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist Joseph Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand-new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea for an unusual and cheaper rebuilding.
But Antoni Gaudí did not design Casa Batlló's house of business.
The architect Joseph Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on his designer board that decorations were created for the property owner's representative apartment as well as the use of mosaics on the facade.
Many other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the design of Casa Batlló started with the successful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Park Güell, in which there are other Gaudí works.
From the locals, soon after completion, the house earned its organic shape by the nickname "House of Bones."
Others began to call it "the yawning house" because of the specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
Hidden religious motifs include other sculptures elements of the building.
Gaudí designed for his time a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five degree slope.
In the creation of Gaudí he absolutely disrespected the construction regulations at the time and did not let them bind him.
At the beginning of the construction, although he obtained a building permit from the city, the figures on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when the construction was completed, the city council was threatened by the result and asked for redress.
The councilman, for example, was upset that the building also interfered with the public pavement.
On the contrary, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully acquired) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building only 15 days after the city's call.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a lounge and on the third floor a bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house crosses the stairwell, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the lounge door and the larger society can communicate comfortably without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the Gaudí house also received an unconventional roof and two extra floors.
Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is lined with inner courtyard, and skylights, is also impressive.
The game of two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most luxurious apartment made available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150-year anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They remained on the tour because they found it to be a very advantageous business and, moreover, extended the tour to common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is certainly not negligible, it amounts to EUR 16.50 and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes have a 20% discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of a house with dragon turrets, you must quickly make friends with one of the residents of the tenement and visit it directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate: women have different requirements than men
Not a fancy bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface, i.e. the mattress and the grate, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously supplemented to suit a particular user.
A lot of things, from weight, height, age, state of health and sex of the owner, decide when to choose.
The type of interior into which mattresses and grates are taken is also important.
Typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages, where they are not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not suitable because they are slowly "warming up."
In addition, they are significantly higher in weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is usually necessary to rotate them regularly.
If they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still on a solid plate, they hold the humidity: there might be a mold under them.
The custom is also the choice.
Who has spent a long time abroad, where they often use a very high mattress with a softening layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they wouldn't sleep here."
"They needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam for their bruised shoulders, heels and hips."
"These are recommended for people with diabetes who have nervous system disorders, so they take ill-received information" from joints and skin, "explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, but also other customers, were therefore looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"It's okay now, the suitable mattress has Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL guy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" works easily.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape based on absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you don't roll over at night like you did after a tough fight.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against bedsores.
When selecting the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of around 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm, together 180 cm.
For single beds, such as single sheets, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands comfortably slightly curved in your elbow," advises Helena Prokop, Cechmaster of the Cechu of upholstery and decorators, who have been devoted to the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lecturing it in professional schools.
For a double bed, each one needs its own grate and mattress, but here be careful when buying in order to align the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount grates at different heights, but you may not succeed at every frame of the bed.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be counted on the forming and tilting layer.
"When touching your hands or getting on the mattress, you must definitely not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokop.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Full-bodied beds, where mattresses and foundation are like siamese twin beds, have no place in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are badly ventilated, they can't be washed, which is common nowadays.
And since we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat in the night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
This is why experts reject advertising slogans about the lifetime of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its own but.
Therefore, the practice advice from retailers: do not give up on 120 or 140 cm width mattresses and workable coating, but instead add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Even though the mattress covers are normally made today with sliders all over the perimeter, so that after unbuttoning, we get two parts (for washing and washing machine size very important!), yet the manipulation of larger types (and one person) when shooting could remind you of a light weight match in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a hard plate in your bed instead of a grate?
Never!
At the most, a one-night stand.
However, provide the plate (if it does not already have it) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in sachets (of German. Taschenfederkern) and a pendulum layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
A latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-looming lamellar grids with 14 to 18 lamels, but you will always be paid for grids with a larger number of lames, 28 or more, where loins are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
A mattress with a spring skeleton is not included in the positioning grids because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the lamel, the so-called shoulder cradle can be provided.
It is a special gripping of the lames, which allows you to push or even tilt the lamella so that the shoulder of the sleeper is "nice" in.
For men who have "shoulders all over their backs," definitely an important thing.
Even the mattress manufacturers, who started using the softening zone in the "men's" area, remember it.
Women are also remembered - they are given a softer surface in hip areas.
For the most demanding customers, they are designed with rectangular or plate grids with so-called multi-torsion wiping.
The pressure decomposes to more points and the voltage decreases.
However, as soon as you use the correct mattress and grate the wrong pillow (large and "bloated"), most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
50 x 60 cm is recommended as a suitable size, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the cushion should balance the height of the arm (together with the shoulder cradle of the grate or softened zone in the mattress).
The modern mattresses have something to do with the original straw-filled straw.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or, at least, additives.
The trend is just organic in the mattress.
The crude oil from which polyurethane foam is produced is replaced by natural oils such as jump and soya.
Right now, all the known producers are using soy.
"Bio u mattresses means that the core is made of material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also afford microcapsules to relax the fresh smell of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man "cools" the plant extract from the birch to absorb the mattresses heat and cool the body, the women, on the other hand, are "drowning."
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (has larger pores with damaged cell structure, is thus more breathable than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of various hardness of cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, loins and heels should be.
For quality mattress you will pay from 7,000 crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters have a lower VAT rate are taken as medical aids.
He was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and a grate isn't easy.
Sometimes you can use the events of producers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with a memory foam to the cover for 11 990 crowns.
The second can be bought free of charge.
The era of lazy or viscosity-elastic foam with an open cell structure and high density started the "cosmic" tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overload at the start.
The tempur in heat is softening, in the cold it solidifies.
The warm body is so perfectly adapted and its pressure is optimally decomposed.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedsores, but also for increasing the comfort of sleeping.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for example for special pillows under the legs, which relieve the legs and venous system.
Domestic producers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and such.
People's tracking machines want more and more parents, so they want to keep their kids safe.
Fear for your own child brings more and more people to the idea of GPS babysitting.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also monitor the movement of people and thus help, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of 9-year-old Anna Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A lot of people were terrified of the missing Annie case and started looking for ways to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case, such devices may be misused, for example, if they are put in a bag by someone who doesn't know, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Usually customers actually buy it for security reasons," added Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" is used and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Boček points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like this, they'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose things when they don't want to be in control."
"Great expectations were raised earlier with parents by cell phones, but they can be turned off just like these tracking devices," says Bočková.
According to it, it is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the kidnapping is concerned, the perpetrator will virtually always ensure that the child has no electronics to reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices start to expand, they'll be looking for them, too, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that a similar device may help in the event of sudden infestation by a pedophile.
According to Robert Czech from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack, its presence can help.
"The device may be adjusted to periodically send the position after a certain period of time. '
"Should damage occur, at least the last position of the person concerned shall be available. ';
"Expensive devices have also built-in tilting meters, so even if a man just slipped and remained still, the machine will immediately send out a warning with a position indication," says Czech Republic.
According to him, smart mobile phones with navigation can also carry a similar service, where you can upload special software.
The problem with current surveillance units is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
That's always the risk of losing them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, therefore, a device that looks like a standard digital watch is now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in that any aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or recognize them after a while and it can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device develops into bracelets or necklaces, they will still use the same technology used to guard cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning (which uses conventional autonavigation) and mobile phone functions that report the current position of the car.
The army has a fuse to confuse the Czech Republic. But it only lasts two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of lines to launch explosives.
Last year, the Department of Defense put a 70-mile line in storage.
The army has a supply of 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the lines is two, four years tops.
The army bought fuse lines from the stock STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
In order to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNES fuse lines, the General Staff replied that soldiers consume 60 km of matches per year in training.
However, it follows from the calculations made by the military bomb technicians that the Ministry of Defence, secretaries or cleaners would then have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnics training every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick, including.
It's the only way to justify the annual consumption of an army of 60 kilometers of matches.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the military supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, it were true that the basic training of each new professional would be sufficient for up to a maximum of two metres of fuse line, as the experts say, the army has secured, even with increased consumption of grooms or special forces, supplies for the aforementioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra personally that they have almost no bullets in small arms, so the shooting for money is also limited due to the emergency.
Not to mention lack of underwear.
"I don't care either, they're buying so many matches from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what they need it for."
"For us, the army is a good customer we try to accommodate as traders," says the business manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres of purchased lines, even by having the military supply of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of the four-year life of the fuse box and of the police or military pyrotechnicians even of only two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish a name because of military criticism.
At the end of life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the soldiers of life.
But these tests are not free and they cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry is a quantity discount of 445 kilometres of fuse lines.
"It cost us 60% less than last year's delivery of two hundred forty-four kilometers," the spokesperson Peisek gave the opinion of the Ministry of Defence's buyers.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of the firing lines of police pyrotechnicians who have been liquidating World War II ammunition or after the Soviet army has not been more than 1,500 metres over the last few years.
And the police always order just enough to consume this ammunition before the end of life.
It has been proven for the safety of the pyrotechnicians, and it can also be more flexible to obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of lines.
The Ministry of Defence is already in considerable trouble with the destruction of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the 200-thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to campaign on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnicians that the MF has addressed today, is facing the same problem in a few years' time: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old matches that are now "cheap."
To this day, I draw on the contacts that I gained through the competition.
The winning spot in the trade fair of the year helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year's trade fair competition was 28-year-old businessman Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there was no quality accommodation for a reasonable price.
With savings from foreign brigades and bank loans, he bought a half-broken house with five apartments.
That was a lot of courage for him to be a third-grade student back then.
"The then ratio between quality and the price of accommodation in our country did not give me a chance to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment started renting to foreign workers.
All the profits invested back in the house which gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, there was another one with the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in the island of Tisé, where we sold our franchising concept and other interested in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels," says last year's businessman number one.
"And in this sale of the license to operate the hotel, it was the victory in the competition of the Provence of the Year," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him more acquaintance and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me afterwards, and I must say that it was pleasant," he remembers.
Participation in the competition is strongly recommended to all those who are trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win, every visibility is good.
He says he's still drawing on contacts and connections that he might not have gotten to.
"Some of them I met through the competition, I started doing business on a regular basis."
The glory associated with success, according to him, has kind of fallen on every employee.
And he's got about 70 of them.
"I observe with them greater loyalty and pride that he is involved in something that has received universal recognition."
"It's far from my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is placed in the foreground," says Luke Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at Farmet.
Euphoria quickly replaced the effects of the crisis from victory.
But thanks to the ambition of the winner, Farmet has had worse times.
For the first prize in the last year of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďářský, reached the Slovakian house last year.
The jury then appreciated the effort through which it built a company with hundreds of millions of turnover from a small tool shop in České Skalice.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my co-workers and increased our confidence in the competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered the father of Karl Zdářský to rent a small workshop to compensate the Communists for confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in the firm where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his dad they started a company for plastic baths.
Not long later, they started specializing in plant oil presses.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Even among the non-professional public, the company received greater awareness after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to perceive the Farmet brand much better, but also the foreign partners started to appreciate that they were working with the company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Zdářský.
But the past year was not just a sign of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
The valuation was based on the economic results of the company until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the hardest year for selling engineering goods.
The crisis, which has not yet touched the citizens so much, has culminated, but firms have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to limit purchases of new machinery and technology.
"This situation, of course, was also inevitable to us."
"The sales fell by 40 percent, we had to cut production and there was also redundancies," explains Karel Žďářský.
A viable company has to be able to take such unpopular measures sometimes.
But they managed and kept the company profitable, albeit less than before the crisis.
However, what they did not reduce in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre from subsidies, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we have won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďářský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
The sales are growing again and the number of new employees with them.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žďářský.
A poll that removes senseless regulations
The Absurdite of the Year survey is the fourth part of the business.
Some senseless regulations have already been abolished.
The infamous winner of the next year's Absurdita poll became the duty to wear documents to the office that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of less than 4,000 votes have decided on this.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the business register for checks on insurance payers," said the spokesperson ČSSZ Jana Buranová.
Shine light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the senseless one is the purpose of the Absurdita of the Year competition.
This is the fourth time this year in the business race organised by the Economic Newspapers and is increasingly popular among the public.
If about 3,000 votes took part in the vote last year, there were almost four thousand of them this year.
And no wonder, all kinds of legal obligations that only serve to stall business are still enough and enough for us.
"For example, we are in the number of tax returns in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation is not particularly improving in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed itself in 74 positions in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is carried out annually in accordance with the same scenario.
Anyone can sign up for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September when the contest is closed.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used to log in. Then the organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-cene" and lets the public vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz / absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdite who gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, namely 105 regulations and regulations that lack meaning, have been added to this year's survey.
Tips have been sent by entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was a requirement for motorways and express roads maintenance cars to pay tolls, or for entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven designs is published on the website of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by a person of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted this competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot function where the state is throwing a stick at the entrepreneurs, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs each year that are only complicating business unnecessarily today," said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to disrupt senseless regulations doesn't sound empty.
In 2007, people were most concerned about the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where a permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with a stand for an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation has been removed by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was reported to the Labour Office as a foreign employee on a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the Green Card Act.
And third time's the charm.
In 2009, the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two weight scales in the office became an absurdity.
This was mitigated by the Ministry of Health decree this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen out.
New category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects shall be evaluated.
This year's fifth annual competition of Economic Newspapers is a category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a sensible and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the promoter and guarantor of the competition, as well as in the event of the rebel of the year.
In this year's first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafone Company main competition in 2010, companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on a separate article.
Although the object of their activity is different from the other diametrically, the common denominator of their efforts can be considered to be support and consideration.
In one case, for example, it concerns people with disabilities and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 country-wide finalists was the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been a major contributor to the foundation fund sponsoring handicapped children for 17 years.
The paper factory from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of its disabled employees, has acquired the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and has been ranked third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, won the victory even lower to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for buying it from Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains Director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company, Enlogit from the Ústí Region, is thinking about the health of its employees and has acquired ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the Human in distress foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ondřej Dry.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which in the form of superstandard bonuses contributes to their pension insurance.
"In our country, we make contributions to food, transport, improvement of qualifications and recreation," says Josef Stračák from the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The category of Responsible Company of the Year was automatically logged in by all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete questionnaire replies were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the company's representatives did not answer the questions, the company responsible could not participate in the competition of the year, but are not disqualified from the" main "competition of the Vodafone Company of the year."
"It is not possible to enter the competition separately because it is a subcategory of the company's main competition," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police arrested in a public tender
In the Land Fund building in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have arrested in recent days.
Detectives put handcuffs on a local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboshi G.
It allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public tender to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by specific bidders.
Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"In the meantime, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for a misdemeanor in a public contract and a public tender," said the Chief of Public Prosecutor Antonia Zelená, saying that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Forty-four-year-old businessman was released by police officers after 24 hours.
In view of the minimal official information, it is only possible to speculate on how it could influence the competition.
A spokesperson for the Land Fund Lubomír Černá, at the request of the Law, stated that police were actually arrested at a secluded workplace in Pilsen during a tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she stated.
According to Black, the competition has the correct title "Invitation to submit a land transfer claim under the Land Transfer Act 'and takes place when more than one eligible applicant is interested in the land offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their restitution entitlements to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land. '
"According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirer shall be established and the Land Fund shall then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," explained the Fund spokesperson.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who entered the challenge, and since he is also a legitimate person because he bought up a number of restitution claims, he offered to the interested party that he would not participate in the competition.
He probably cashed in severance pay for that.
That would explain how he had such a large amount of money in custody.
Luboš G. had superior contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
In the case of former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitution, on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was at that time that Luboš G. acquired land from the Fund, for example, for the construction of public roads, specifically at the place where the access to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he swapped them with the Magistrate for a house in the historical center of the city itself, which was worth much more.
That's when City Hall had to go for it, because otherwise, by blocking the land, it would have put the construction at risk.
Households pay extra hundreds a month
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and bilge, heat supplies and there will also grow rents.
Families will thus have to pull hundreds more crowns out of their wallets from January than they do now.
Electricity gets up to 4.6 percent, gas gets about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth of it in some cities you have to pay extra for water supplies and many times also undermines the supply of central heat.
The cost of electricity should be 100 kroner a year for housing households than they are now.
In doing so, all major suppliers have reduced their prices, so there is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic.
Although gas is slightly expensive, it is at a time when people are drowning most and have the highest consumption.
Every year, they must also count on hundreds of extra crowns.
While electricity and gas are heating up throughout the Republic, the change in prices of central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about CZK 50 per month for central heating from January onwards, more than CZK 1000 per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague are in danger of getting more than 9% of the price of water and tawdry, if the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the roasted 6.8 percent will be paid.
The price in Prague, however, will still be among the lower in the country-wide comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it has an aqueous and bilge price of 7.4 percent.
For example, they can significantly increase the rent price in 450 thousand rental apartments, where regulations have ended since January.
For example, CPI Apartments, which owns about 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to 100% from January.
Those who won't agree to the new lease amount are going to put the company in court.
The regulated rents paid by people in around 300,000 flats could increase by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks that, after drinking, most often end up in the care of doctors, drunks who haven't even been 15 years old.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from monkeys in a hospital.
This results from the experience of doctors who experience similar cases on the income of the hospital's children.
"Some beers or wines are totally uncool because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," said the Chief of the Children's Department of the Hospital Horovice in Central Bohemia Luděk Pelican.
"If they can pull a bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's like whiskey, but there's fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into their juice and it doesn't smell so good," explained the chief.
And the spokesperson for the University Hospital Motol Eva Jurin gives him the truth.
"The most common is fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovitz that they brought home," said Jurin.
According to Mayor Pelikan, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers on hospital income are quite common.
Before Hořovice, where he has been active since this year, he worked for ten years on paediatrics in Motola, where the ambulances are bringing in obscene schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl lying with us about four times."
"She started her career when she was 12 years old, when she was brought to us with 3.5 more alcohol in her blood in combination with ecstasy," described the doctor in a particularly serious case.
"She was at a show in Holešovice at some dance party."
"Interestingly enough, her mother did not find it strange that she had not known for 48 hours about her daughter," the chief of staff wondered.
It is the parents' lack of interest, or even their considerable tolerance, to drink their own offspring, that is considered the main cause of growing child drinking.
However, dependency in the true sense of the word cannot be talked about in children, according to experts.
"Under the term" alcoholic "means several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena involved, and that is not the case in children."
"Those who use alcohol repeatedly are more likely to be marked by a failed family-social background," explained Chief Chief Pelikan.
According to Jurin's spokesperson, this year, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at Motola's pediatric clinic until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication that had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children's drunks, who take their parents home after emergency care, or the police take them home, do not count.
Except when children sit down after school and drink a bottle of hooch, there are three seasonal fluctuations according to Pelican that can be relied upon: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink grief from a bad report card, or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course, I have seen seven drunks in the reception of witches at once," said Pelican.
A drunk who spends the night detoxifying under medical supervision is paradoxically at the advantage of having an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will drive away the water infusions with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They're actually better off because they have a nice evening experience and a good awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only confused by where they are," Pelican admitted that he occasionally spoils the patient's pleasant mood with at least the cost of their treatment.
The transport by ambulance and hospitalization in an acute bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a educational tool when I calculated directly to those kids on rounds how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer at the brigade to earn money for that one party," Pelikan added.
However, health insurance companies do not, in his view, accept regression procedures in which they would enforce treatment costs after their parents, in cases of child drunks.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of the five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M, flew on Tuesday to Sevilla, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they've only been to practice or show-and-tell years abroad.
It is a two-digit version of L-159T1, which has been operated by the Czech army so far and which has been able to fly.
The remaining three machines are one-digit L-159.
They stand preserved in Aero Vodochody and the broker - Omnipol - took over as early as last week.
According to Jan Pejšek, he is not yet known when he physically dispatches the aircraft from Vodochod.
"L-159 single-digit aeroplanes for the shift have been earmarked from long-term aircraft stowed, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry Department. '
"The two-digit L-159T1 has been changed in its present state and form," said Peišek Law.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater planes, because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth CZK 200 million to rebuild four useless L-159 machines into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other took over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS have undertaken to force the aircraft into the weaponry of some alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the buyer of L-159 aircraft is EADS and will be used to train NATO pilots. '
"It is therefore a matter for the customer to see how this matter will be implemented," said Pejšek.
The business paper said some time ago that, for example, the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the Government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
The then defense leadership argued that the exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aer and only used 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa's planes will probably have a court-martial finish.
In fact, the European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender rather than by addressing one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Kbela Prague airport within 14 days.
Longer index finger than ring finger indicates lower cancer risk
Men who have a forefinger longer than a ring finger are at less risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by a British cancer magazine.
It could be related to the levels of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under the age of 60," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, Professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, has been provided by Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 prostate cancer patients with colleagues in Britain, and simultaneously over 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had a index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring finger.
They paid for the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, for those who had a index finger longer than a ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men up to the age of 60, even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - appears to reflect the various levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone matches a longer index finger.
Early research has shown that testosterone is the one that promotes growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Paches for ČTK said that he knew about this study very well, but he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "fully proven."
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and pavements lies mostly cruised snow, road drivers in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents in trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher at the Central Automotive Club told the news.
There was a truck crash at 91st kilometer, two trucks collided at 93rd kilometer, the accident claimed injury.
Several cars have also ended up in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
The drivers should ride just behind Brno on the 190th kilometre or drive through Brno and then ride the 182nd kilometer on the Gouge.
There are several kilometer columns forming there.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies several centimeters of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
The motorcade is formed on Prosek, for example, and it is also blocked by Srboholskaya.
The most secure means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
At 8: 00 a.m., the Prague Crisis Staff is due to take part again.
Railways and airports also face problems.
ČD already had to cancel seven express connections due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralup or Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyne was closed from Wednesday 11: 00 a.m. to 5: 00 a.m. in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already mobile, but only with caution.
In Vyškovsk there are three non-accessible side roads, in Brno there are snow languages and in Blanensk some roads are needed to overcome in the above places snow chains.
The most affected areas were Vyškovsko.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatika - Milesovice.
We're gonna have to put the milling machines in their stretch.
When they will be cleared, there is no way to guess.
Caution should be exercised in the White Carpathians area in Hodonín.
On the roads, which are kept there only by inert sprinkling for the protection of nature, there is up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, stated by ČTK.
In the Czech Republic it attacked from two to ten centimeters of snow, most of which fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow occurred.
The snow in the Czech Republic gradually stops.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The US military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the Taliban's conflict there and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is like a little super-precision cannon.
Its projectiles guide the laser to within a few meters.
The 25-millimeter special rounds, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, actually act as small grenades.
The charges can be programmed to detonate not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic route.
It can therefore be used against an enemy that hides behind some obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
Because the mountain is not usually protected, and if a deadly rain of steel shrapnel falls on it, it can take it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audette, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"In principle, the soldier treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to determine the distance, thus obtaining the specified point of intent, adjusting the aim and pulling the trigger."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon is charged and detonated at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," said Audette.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu concert will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the current administration building to Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Fujitsu Group of Japan will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field that specializes in computers and their maintenance said on Wednesday, in July next year 400 men and women will move their jobs from the current administration building to Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to Fujutsu, there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which are still divided in the region, moving there in the near future.
The offer of rent was said to be very attractive and the large space office in Astro Park is said to be more suited to the working methods of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central headquarters in Frankfurt-Niederrad with excellent infrastructure."
An excellent connection with the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important business within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
The chief economic officer at Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that he was able to get a "global player."
It is said to be a "fantastic display of confidence in this location."
Fujitsu is said to fit the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was reported to have been informed in good time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered the firm our help," said Korwise.
But friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property on Marienbader Square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus Square, which so far used Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" ten years ago, together with the other buildings on Marienbader Square, were among the most discussed construction projects of the spa city.
Between the station and the city hall was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticised both because of the massive construction of the areas which previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, a company of investment advice and ratings, Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, as well as a computer manufacturer of Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and were sold after a year to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group from Tokyo is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computer and server companies available and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujitsu's employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiary of Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS will move to Frankfurt-Niederrad.
The Astro Park administration building rented 7000 square metres for this purpose.
In the complex - its name draws attention to the star floor plan, which is twenty years old, is also based among others the central union of electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon turns off server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting in a tight spot.
Amazon's Internet service turned off its detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was the result of political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is believed to be in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, US prominent Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is listed as wanted by Interpol, is to be held by one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the activists announced the publication by the Twitter short message service on Wednesday (local time).
Amazon has recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) 's secret diplomatic messages to manage a high number of access to documents.
With Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this step: "Fine - our dollars will now be spent by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such freedom of speech issues, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers were reported to have conducted a search, published CNN TV stations on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
The Chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened to boycott Amazon, informing the British "Guardian."
"I would have liked Amazon to have taken this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman has called for a platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, blatantly and insolently, and that puts our national security at risk and puts life on the planet at risk," said one statement from a non-party senator.
"No responsible firm - either American or foreign - should be able to help Wikileaks expand their efforts to distribute stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list of wanted by Interpol.
Based on a report in London's "The Independent" newspaper, 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the scheming of his opponents.
A spokesman for Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were even calls to assassinate Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is right to fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was probably responding to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that the person responsible for the publication on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, one chief of government advisor Stephen Harper said on television - probably ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use the "target plane."
In the meantime, there's been a verbal shooting between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd," that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently published spy challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The US government is now widely exploring the safety of its data banks.
A special delegate was appointed Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, told the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of the "necessary reforms in the structure," which are necessary after the publication of the reports from the Wikileaks Embassy.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger because of the Wikileaks publication.
"We did everything we could to get in touch with them," said the Foreign Office spokesperson Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if it's necessary."
Ice cream University
The "Gelato University" at Bologna is being prepared by ice cream confectioners for a better season.
There is a great interest in the basic course for the future ice cream maker, which takes three days, and visitors arrive from all over the world.
Where does that ice cream come from, anyway?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech little old-fashioned ice cream maker, produces cream according to all rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelatai takes ice cream out of the cooler with a spatula, wipes it into a waffle and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But those who want to learn more about ice cream will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, an ice-cream machine manufacturer set up an ice-cream university so that ice-cream from his machines would match all the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, is a huge interest and visitors arrive from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some yearn for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others dare for the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer in the future a quality European product in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Kairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia has arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake during his training: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a great deal of romance."
The first step in production seems quite simple.
Luciano inserts the essential ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which warms everything up to 85 degrees by electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then it turns on the machine with the tap and the pasteurized white base cream, the base of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately the docent is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without stabilizer?
How can a man experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients," probably used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it has to be sold in one day, otherwise it collides and the customer eats ice beans.
Certain variations in basic matter are allowed.
It'll be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes with the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of aromatised ingredients on you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with white base ice cream that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of all kinds of chocolate temptations.
He may now take a course for the ice cream machines.
Luciano has made four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavourings or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment shall be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More flavors, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more hazelnut when it contains more hazelnut.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture raises the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content of the basic recipe must be reduced.
With lemon ice cream, you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out the apparatus to determine the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers measure the grape cider).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as it used to.
It is not only an automatic base-material machine that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously shuffles the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools it to a minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo gets himself and his colleagues dirty from top to bottom with a fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Revizors in double light
The European Food Authority Efsa is associated with an industry that experimented with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of Testbiotech experts who consider themselves an independent institute to estimate the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said the head of Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically altered plants, Harry Kuiper, and other expert Efsa have had a contract with Ilsi lobbyists for several years.
It is financed by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been a decisive part of the Efsa control regulations for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticising Then.
The rules of the Efsa are said to be in line with the Ilsi documents, and they carry the manuscript of the industry, which should be controlled by the Office of the Italian Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efsa switched to the Swiss agrarian Syngenta Group without amendments or transitional time - and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also revealed recently the staffing of the EU Industrial Lobby Control Office, which has aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efsa can't recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from industry, if they are of high technical quality, it is stated in a single declaration.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with industry.
But they have to prove it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It itself is referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, for the estimation of the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically altered plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that genetic plant reactions to environmental effects are not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically altered corn will do in the field," says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not prove reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, how can they be found?" asks Then, the plaintiff.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
A scientist has been studying genotech since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical College in Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is attempting to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
That is why there are hardly any scientists anymore who are not connected to the concerts.
Most studies are not published that are critical to companies.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Stone Footprint
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing outside a station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: in September, the baguers arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction of the railway station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It melts: "Cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When he cut one open, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former French army munitions depot, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all that came out during the Stuttgart demolition.
"It would be a shame if they were to grind into gravel or disappear into deponics," he said in his office, a wooden booth, which was a former house of security.
He says they called him names and threatened him when all the newspapers in September said he bought the remains of the north wing from a demolition company.
But he's been talking to S-21's opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he wasn't responsible for the demolition at all.
And when that happens, it's the most sensible thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then he took about 200 S-21-opponents each one about 80 kilograms of heavy block, price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope of returning it in the re-construction process.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 big trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest sold out a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscaping gardeners, house builders.
They came from all over the place and dragged everything that fit in the trunk and on the trailer.
Stuttgart rocks have long since turned into "walls" or as the edges of herbs beds.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political input."
He gets in his off-road car and goes for a ride on his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, suspended his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a lover of stones.
It's got 40,000 tons of rocks stashed in it.
They tie their treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the Republic.
It's stopping.
In the snow lies artistically treated sandstone.
"Once belonged to the Marien-bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sand from the Elbe, yellow, warm, he's excited.
"My favorite rock."
We're on our way up through the woods.
Shows the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And then.
"Nice travertine."
One time, those suits belonged to the Neckarstadium stand in Stuttgart.
All over the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how they used to break the stones by hand and move them through simple pulleys and bulls, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a thing were to be crushed."
He didn't become rich, he didn't become very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
That's where the stones will be saved.
High-Potential Talent Fight
There's a lot of people at the diner.
16 students are pushed by sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with the VW developers, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies try in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditorium as soon as possible, before they reach the labour market and are interested in others.
Since universities do not publish any lists of the success of their students, companies try to discover exceptional talents in practical projects and acquire them.
At TU Braunschweig, a car group is trying to get talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department is handing out pens, rubber bears and VW logo plates.
It tells promising young talent about practical programs, student jobs and suggests their journey to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would be suitable as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Sella, is not unusual.
But the news is, there's such an open struggle for students.
"Otherwise he was more of a major expert project," says Selle.
I think the fight for fresh graduates is gonna be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long numbers of applicants.
On the contrary, they must strive and try to attract particularly highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the VDI Association of German Engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, the so-called lack of engineers will continue to grow.
For KPMG's audit and advisory firm, Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt.
Organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure race where participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
The participants can also see the KPMG branches and get to know the company.
In advance, two selection rounds will decide who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested will fly to the USA.
In the High Potentials competition at the universities, the Dycts will apply ever-harsher laws.
"We want to be different from the others with our Race."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like Dykt's talent hunter is lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in a similar event last year."
"Some are about to graduate and plan to apply for a job," he says.
In addition to speaking directly on campus, small and medium-sized companies present themselves in classic labour markets.
"We're trying to contact alumni at professional exhibitions."
"Like Intersolar," Sith Stübe, head of the personnel department of Solarworld Solar Technology manufacturer, reports.
The company from Bonn employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently 35 positions are listed on the company's website.
"At the moment, it's difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors say it's possible for us to practice or write a thesis."
The solar specialist doesn't hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Large concerts often cannot offer it," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
Money has not played a major role in finding work for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good practice options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by Great Place to Work.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks the co-workers how happy they are with their work and working environment and monitors the framework conditions of the staff.
The head of the personal department of Stübe hopes that the placement will bring her points with the people interested in the job.
"I believe that interested parties are particularly aware of the external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, that means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become visible as an attractive employer leads through your own employees," he says.
It is technically called the internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of an employer in the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best emissaries."
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game," says Kriegler.
Obama Stopping New Oil Drills
There will be no new oil wells outside the coast of the US-Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico over the next few years.
The government in Washington issued an adequate ban - and in doing so it definitively abolished earlier plans.
Also, new wells are banned before the Atlantic coast.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar told us on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to take place.
The advocates are trying to reduce the US's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The focus of criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted by billions of requests.
The investigation committee entrusted with Obama should present the results during December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drill ban that has been in effect since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil groups submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster by more stringent controls and strict security regulations.
At present, there is a fundamental reform of the supervisory authority, which has drawn attention to many corruption accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would lift the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that more stringent regulation will significantly reduce the volume of extracted oil in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industries," the result of the current survey in the field by the consulting firm BDO - before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
In addition, the American Energy Alliance is complaining about uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what will change by regulation."
Investment in new mining projects is being shifted until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down.
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People make their living stealing, corruption, and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," calms the journalist's environmental activist: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
A 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who wanders over the breast with the water surrounding the smudges: the scene works almost nicely in the water gloss with rainbow colors.
You can't see the brown clots of oil floating below the surface.
She used to collect enough garnel in the vessels, telling Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetta River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, large amounts of oil were poured into a vast, lukewarm area from a broken line.
The fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, which is located in the heart of the Niger Delta, belongs to one of the worst infested areas in the world.
On the way along the river mangrove swamps with lots of side tributaries is still noticeable the entire range of the trigger.
The engine on the boat cooks brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever puts his hand in the water pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves stick out of the ground like black sticks of licorice, seldom occurring palm trees leave their leaves sad hanging.
We are in vain looking for flocks of birds, which are normally found in wet areas: as soon as the engine on the boat dies down, it spreads in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, spooky silence.
"What is happening here is the environmental leadership of the war," says the sad Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear for health."
A comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where the battle has been fought for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe came here, where the first resistance was formed with the later executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa, where Shell had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for the employees.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni region: while the entire area of the three-size Swiss delta is benefiting daily with over 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of lead of more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni region lie fallow, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred metres, the steel structures of the water stand as bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees," so the heads of drilling holes are too gently called.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty up to the marrow.
Every once in a while, the head of the drilling hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then the constant flow of oil flows into the water.
According to experts estimates, more than two billion litres per 50 years have flowed into the ecosystem in the Delta: Every year, the amount of oil that flowed into the sea at Alaska in the crash of the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes as to who is responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While Shell refers to the sabotage and organised oil theft at more than 90% of the pollution, environmental protectors refer to the cracking heads of drilling and loose leads as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, accused a group in 2008 by US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only a number of failures on the lines are said to be "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks like a remote abandoned, oil-stained workshop in the open air, it emerges from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partially connected by management, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
Oil heats up in a barrel over a fire for hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline runs out of the lead into the pot, then it drips at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels of 300 litres a day: "We'll make, like, $34,000 of Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents are using chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria only owns one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents euro per litre of diesel can still be overpowered by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from the "bunkers" that connect to the Ogoni leadership: experts say that at least 16 million litres of oil disappear every day in the Niger Delta area.
But only a negligible part of the provisionally stored raw material will be illegally bred: the largest share will be filled by organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers, and sold on the world market.
The debate whether the population and their interventions or the lax way of production caused disaster is considered purely academic by Akpobari activist.
"If oil companies weren't considered intruders, and they hadn't completely destroyed the life-form of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, and no illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell is so damaged that only the passing of the group can be considered: "Perhaps other nations will prove to be better than the Chinese."
Michael will get upset.
"It's high time for you to disappear," says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If a special military unit found them, they wouldn't be in jail, but a painful bribe.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has brought our country to the bottom in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in the A380 engines.
A380 obviously has a major security malfunction.
Investigators have detected a possible construction error during the search of the machine that has landed in an emergency that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of Qantas's airbus were probably luckier on an emergency landing in early November than was known: the Australian Air Safety Authority detected a major safety flaw in its investigations on the engines of some A380 - and is now warning against a possible construction error.
Perhaps a glitch would have severe consequences: one oil connection could cause cracks due to wear and tear, this Thursday in a published statement by the ATSB.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the airbus of Qantas, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a plea before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
The head of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and the surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified the burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out additional security tests with giant aeroplanes equipped with the engines concerned.
Security recommendations are the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiencies were considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After an emergency landing, the Qantas aircraft company left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced an A380 engine as a precaution.
A two-story plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
National snowfall will cause chaos in transport
Germany, all in white: almost all over the country, snowed overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and planes are disturbed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost the entire Republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures in the snow - leading in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east lies up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
On several highways and many roads there is a strong limited traffic.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still deployed, but it could not handle the new snow.
In addition, there was a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Authority (BSH) expects a stormy flood of 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning.
Snow drapes have caused considerable problems in Saxony on motorways and state roads.
According to the weather centre, Meteomedia was therefore the highest level in Saxon Switzerland.
Part of it attacked 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused drapes.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left there last night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities have reported major road problems.
On A2 the wind and snow caused slow traffic and constipation.
There was trouble in Thuringia due to snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Railroad, major difficulties arise in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on tracks, inverted trees on tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
Long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
In Thuringian Saalfeld he had to stop an ICE to Munich.
165 passengers received wool blankets, food and drink from fire and rescue workers on the train.
The snow wind was blowing across the road.
Many flights were cancelled at large German airports due to snowwinds.
According to the spokesperson for the information on the flights, they have already been reported from Munich's annulled flights.
In Frankfurt, according to Fraport, 40 flights have been cancelled.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although few passengers were left unconnected at the airport, 400 field beds were prepared for them.
Many roads have had accidents on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to the snow road: there was also a truck caught on the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
And then a 30-year-old woman died after she turned over on a slippery road at Aschaffenburg with her car.
But meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of a light powder, and therefore it will rise even with light rips of wind.
But the wind will fade.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds with the power of the whirlwind.
But it's going to be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for towers-twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at Frankfurt headquarters.
Real estate could bring up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank had just renovated its seat of the group: the towers-twins in Frankfurt's banking district were modernising; in the meantime, bankers were allowed to go back to their old jobs.
But now the financial group probably wants the renovation costs back - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers to inform the "Financial Times Deutschland" with a reference to the spokesperson.
The spokesman didn't name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still looking at whether it is more meaningful to own or sell the property and then rent it again," he said.
This renounces the largest credit institution in Germany once again after a short time giving up its corporate headquarters.
The Bank only took over the towers-twins in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from investors in its own fund and subsequently renovated them in a costly way.
According to the figures, the energy conversion swallowed around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, experts estimate the value of the towers renamed "Greentowers" to be around EUR 500 million.
The spokesman said it was undecided whether the building would be sold back to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn dead miners
More than 10,000 people respected the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
We still haven't managed to rescue the dead, because the security situation is still complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where there was an accident, but there was no sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend to safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that the miners had no chance of surviving.
Still failed to deliver the dead.
Now they honor the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand, 10,000 people gathered in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
29 tables were built to honor the monuments of buried miners, with helmets, lamps and names of miners on them.
Also pictures and personal things like clothes and surfboards found their place here.
There were flags at half-mast at government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would rise again from the "depths of the earth" to the surface, said to the participants of the memorial event Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in a mine.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the event.
British and South African miners were also overwhelmed during the explosion on November 19.
Paramedics started by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poison gas dissolves, it starts cooling high temperatures inside the mine, told the journalists police president Gary Knowles.
Damn it, warriors!
Does a horror movie go with an art movie?
Director Nicolas Wining Refn is trying to cross the old border again with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience was the Danish director Nicolas Wining Refn thinking about when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his tormentors and in large measure kills his opponents with almost supernatural power - it sounds ideal for young men looking for bloody action, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and even rips his enemies' guts out of his stomach when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as it is actually called, will not say a word during the whole film, and even the other characters will say at most one or two sentences, or will be torn down to the horrifying dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and festering in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the scenery of the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It's good when a film has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher," is considered to be the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but he is stoically resisting to bring his works closer to either a more humorous mainstream or less brutal artistic audience.
Most fans of the art cinema are likely to be discouraged everywhere by the spitting brain and insides.
The supporters of action films will be bored at the latest when One-Eye sets out for freely explained reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will remain hanging in the wind and fog for all eternity, until the team is likely to reach America and remain silent.
It is therefore no wonder that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not get into the cinemas and was now only released on DVD.
It's a shame, especially, because of the beautiful footage, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes covered in blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it's not a dialogue or an exact plot, it's all an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
And there's no escape for the audience.
Refn will not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his frosty shots and his gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, especially with indescribable hatred that flows from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Eyed keeps something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become the time for enemies and temporary allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It's a form of destruction, perhaps only for the depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and admiration.
An experience.
Mysterious land works
The IAEA has a new alert for a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and it will not allow control.
Around midnight, from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes will attack the mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrates; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometers away and its name is Dair as-Saur.
The International Bureau of Nuclear Energy (IAEA) documents show its name when it is a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that diverts from the current.
Based on a communication from the US-US Foreign Intelligence Agency of the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technique of the '50s is no different.
The CIA presented a video of unfocused satellite imagery.
Using computer animation, she explained where the reactor components might have been before the destruction, it is to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of Yongbyon Nuclear Center.
In addition, photographs were submitted showing the building up close or even from the inside.
They say the reactor was shortly before the launch, but still without the fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, there is not much more to know than then, even the riddles have increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was very certain before the attack that Syria was building in el-Kibar reactor, but it had no basis for "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence rapporteurs in Europe are even more careful and speak only of the "alleged reactor," even though they regard the CIA's presentation as "credible."
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
In the question of how sure he is that he has a reactor in front of him, the high diplomat UN replied in the summer, the IAEA said it had "enough material to ask questions."
The rubble allegedly "unused military building" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
Yet in June 2008, the IAEA team was managed by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar to find traces of uranium that was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite photographs of commercial vendors from just after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, this footage is not on the market because it was exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - Israel, perhaps.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But that was refuted by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss things - as has satellite footage.
In addition, he forbade inspectors from a second inspection at el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building.
But Israel, too, is silent.
"We will never comment," recently confirmed the official position at the time of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
Thus, the investigation of this case has been going on for nothing since June 2008, and "is growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Authority," as the high Western diplomat in the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna admitted - this is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three other facilities to be "in a functional connection 'with the alleged reactor to be the key to progress - and, contrary to that, they still exist.
The Revizers have not yet indicated, nor what facilities they are involved in, nor what function they have, or why they are suspected.
According to information from Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA is referred to internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again according to nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite imaging complex buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It appears to be located within or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason, Syria rejects the access of the IAEA to these three locations.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the United States Secret Service facility.
The IAEA has background and satellite imagery that between these three locations and the square near Euphrates, the material has been transported back and forth.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one should be "in connection with fuel production."
However, there is no "any evidence of sensitive activity," i.e. enrichment of uranium and re-processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where it should later be broken off into a bomb, there are only likely estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether debris that could hide important traces are stored in these three places.
It's as if hundreds of cargo trucks have disappeared from the face of the Earth, no one seems to have any information as to where the rubble has gone.
Only a few kilometres away from el-Kibar and on the other side of Euphrates lying the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had checked as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste in 1998, considers the IAEA unlikely.
Former IaEA Inspector Robert Kelley put him in touch with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the images from space show that, after the IAEA demanded access, Syria did land work at all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA spent many months creating a plan for the auditors to allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - only the effort shows how much the interests of the auditors are concerned.
In the meantime, Damascus rejected this proposal, too.
If, a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna calmed down that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why this thing is not burning, the US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, one of the toughest means that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
But, while the Chief of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken about the 'possibility to which I am leaning in the future', he is still hesitant.
On the one hand, a majority is needed in the IAEA Governing Council, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love in times of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on a still nameless overhead primacy in the summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, it's a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but it also causes unrest.
There is a constant talk that the woman who is Muslim will fall in love during the war in Yugoslavia with the Serbian man who raped her.
The Bosnian women's associations protested immediately, so the scheduled shooting from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
In the meantime, the film has finished in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosen.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organisation of Women's War Victims wrote through UN-organisations to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and asked to meet the actress, now informed the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also an ambassador to the UN-organisation to help refugees.
It is not very diplomatic - it has already offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but it has been rejected.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories at the rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended an UN-organisation to assist refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, informing the Guardian.
What scene did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read its script, has allowed filming after minor drills in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author underlines that in her film she does not follow any political intentions, that she has worked hard to address the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give all the parties involved space.
Given the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film that sounds really different on the Internet: the lovers knew each other before the war began and they will meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds different than "rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film really begins before the war is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her that is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now they can get her out of Hollywood: by publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening is once again good for the Irish.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans scream with joy at the sound of loud music, stomping with their feet.
Bailey-Pub is boiling in South Irish Cork because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and hit.
"Beer Pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus and also tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong World Cup in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this loud beer game and a restrained informatics guy, they don't match.
Yet a 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to get away from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not playing passion in Las Vegas, he's on his way to New Zealand interview in January.
"I have a strange feeling about this," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately obtained her dream job as an Eventmanager, perhaps it is a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of the three tanners have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin has a place now as an IT consultant in London.
Boys are leaving: Just like the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country shortly, predicting the experts of the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of the ESRI in Dublin.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the forecasts are confirmed, there will be a similar migratory wave to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After decades of rise, which has brought great prosperity to the Irish, displeasure is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly precarious by young, educated Irish people, who have seen only the rise so far.
The loss of employment and social descent in these years seemed absurd.
The need was everyone, the money was wasted.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, it goes away and our country loses its whole generation."
"The last one please turn off the lights."
Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black, because the government is said to be deceiving and offering no future prospects for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She's watching her classmates go from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she's gonna have to move herself out in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo," an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known about building something else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed together with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction site in Germany.
They're building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen right now.
In January, he goes to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to pay off his house loan.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, when for the first time in a long time he crosses the threshold of his own house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I'm basically not at all."
He laughs embarrassed and walks in cold rooms.
The small house is located in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, large, expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Is she worried that the loan might not go well?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, he fills up the hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; even if things go wrong, I can start over."
A construction engineer doesn't like the lamentation he hears so often now.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it'll make us feel like Irish."
He laughs, and then he talks about his father, who went to England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back again, and life passed on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keep your future open and simply wait for life to evolve elsewhere.
He's also had several years of work in London, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one other thing that concerns him very much these days: his 27th birthday party in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might turn into a bachelor party.
"Don't get emotional," he says, and he drinks a lot of beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The normal practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private business.
Criminal activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And many regions consider Brazil more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of Latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist magazine.
As the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% in that year.
It also grew in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the questions asked in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced democrats, which withdraws the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region have expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (graph 3).
Around 34% said that they trusted the Assembly in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year, but there was a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
The support was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latinos living in poverty only slightly increased in 2009 and fell back to 32% this year.)
However, the mood varies in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its resigning President Luiz Inácia Lula da Silva are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
Only the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Around 31% say that either they or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to the figure 38% of last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private business and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage has increased from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing President Hugo Chávez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area, as 19% of respondents mentioned (compared to 18% of last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical elections
No one expected the general elections in Haiti to be perfect on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsiders who were trying to help a disabled country get scared.
Elections meant filling urns and recurring votes, ballots scattered across the sewers, broken polling rooms and intimidation.
Election room open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved because of the January earthquake, were wandering around trying to figure out where they could vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of anticipated presenters, cried out it was a fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of which were violent, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that "in many respects, it was quite a good election."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have carefully said that "they do not believe that these inconsistencies, however serious they were, did not necessarily have to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, the unpopular resigning president and his candidate Jude Célestino, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martell, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former First Lady, have resigned from their initial call for the vote to be annulled.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or little support among voters, is called a electoral commission for reaching a decisive fight.
Due to the ongoing cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there was concern that electoral turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganisation, they were prevented from doing so.
Around 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained undivided shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that the Haitians will do so themselves.
On tiptoe to the center
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, benefited from public sympathy for her popularity from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Still, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term in next year's elections may depend on the grieving Mrs. Fernández giving up the uncompromising nature of her late husband, the predecessor and Nestor Kirchner's political partner.
And all things will be based on these signs.
Mr Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend more income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost most in Congress last year.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized when Mr. Kirchner died of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where there was slapping and accusing the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, with the President spending more space at will.
The economy is overheating: up to 9% is likely to grow this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for the control of inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared INDEC, a statistical agency that acceded to monitoring official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private businesses and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for exports of Argentinian agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be why President Fernández is letting us know that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government created an agreement with bond holders who had previously refused a debt restructuring that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now President Fernández is facing an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped together in the Paris Club, to which she owes roughly $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this is not in the IMF's sight, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister for Economic Affairs, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index that would resemble the introduction to cleaning INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term of office, when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of a middle class that's tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of Argentina's return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she'll have to decide whether it won't be necessary to quietly renounce the many views her husband held in politics.
Half-encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the legitimate, voted for mayors and city councils in five city districts on 27 November, which can be considered a broader evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that have prevailed over the land and have been strongly placed in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the greatest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only closely.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three out of the five mayor's offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of votes has decreased by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP, along with KMT, was in town councils.
The elections took place like most of the Taiwanese elections, which included noisy polling trucks and mass gatherings with flags with poorly dressed girls.
Part of it was even a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for the KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
The man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien across the face, injured him and killed the viewer.
Bizarre was not determined whether the gunman intended to harm Mr Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Perhaps China was the only great winner of the campaign.
It was remarkable how the question of land itself remained in the background.
Instead, candidates fought over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
So KMT tends to avoid ties to the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also abandoned the provocation of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the reality and to the realization that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his party, has confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would certainly also like to see political integration, but first and foremost.
It's better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President in 2000-08 was a rebel and a supporter of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation has developed that is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai was called a candidate for DPP for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything it can to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai has published plans for research institutes which serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai is telling the Taiwanese public that her party is a "credible alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In his cell statement, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be fighting for a choice among potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's evaluations were wrong, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go on the campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and a deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
The strongly advocated proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point of no return has passed."
Nomination for Grammy: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category best new artist
At the request of the President, and people are bound to notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz basist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is referred to as one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with the Grammy rules, when an artist must not publish more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" has certainly taken a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and agile hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones experienced in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammy voters looking for similar jazz work in this category over the last years.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges rightly appreciate Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing album ride, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboard player John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, the valiant New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of steampunk has earned several well-deserved accolades in the category of large files, where the chamber jazz children Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with "Pathways" has created a beautiful example of how the bass player can have free hand as a bandleader.
Nominations Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical music category
Nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
The leading position in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestra piece, with a number of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California, Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles," a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debated at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a shot at an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Aca-Pekka Salonena.
Approximately 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental performance of a soloist with an orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avitala, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it using tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone conversation.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsky's work.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vicica Genaux and Masha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives approval from the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics attacked the project to promote terrorism and lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in line with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"Opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who oppose only shout out loudly."
"We have some really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time discussions took place with people who were pro or anti-center. These votes were evenly distributed, reported by the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Monkeys with the Statue of Liberty stuck in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centres also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including the proximity of Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on 11 September 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community, with approximately 135 families, has been struggling in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted more and more suitable space than the storage space he rented along with the filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24943 square feet in Mediterranean style architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to 43 feet high.
It should cover a space of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the scope for searching for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental so far.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that it is a form of truly 'extraterrestrial' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of a report that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
For a long time, six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur - were considered essential to life.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You will be amazed at what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for the search for life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this news published to be discussed, which did not reveal the details of the discovery, has given rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider to be 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows replacing one element with another element in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiotics Institute at NASA, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that the microbe, which is exposed to both elements, might be able to replace one after the other.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms can be very difficult to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that, like phosphorus, it does not work. When it enters the organism, it begins to work in biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or month where arsenic is more common is increased.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert assistant in microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but never found an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just in the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four dog shows that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, reported by the sheriff of Los Angeles on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akites and a large pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, told the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs then on Wednesday late evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not found to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two akitas were found at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
The Akita Trace, the three-year-old dog Trace and the 10-month-old bitch Didi, were unharmed, told by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breeds, who were planning to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until they were discovered late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs had to compete in other competitions, planned in the days before the show AKC / Eukanuba show, said Peek Journal The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop at almost a month's travel couple on dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside the window of the room.
They also brought three dogs - puppy boxer, Parson Russell Terrier and Breton Hare - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akits and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in a car that should have been cooler.
They've opened up the windows a little bit so the dogs can get enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a car stolen at 6: 00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dogs, and the dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether awards would be awarded.
Once again, the lion is ready to scream now that the restructuring of MGM is finally approved by the court.
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvency Judge of New York officially blessed the "pre-packaged" plan of creditors to settle about $5 billion of debt and to clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of movies and television shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy order does not leave any legal obstacles for MGM to be able to restart the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the leading leaders of the slender study.
The number of employees will fall to around 320 from the original more than 400.
The MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on the planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to finance new operations and MGM production.
It is now a link with the investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management fought to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
On that August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnover expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts by Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to sell the company at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the funds required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began to work on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies that collect for their services that run the company, $375,000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which this year only released one film and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will come out in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, which will be presented in the book "Hobit," together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns around 18% of MGM's debts, was looking for the possibility of merging his studies with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Technology toys that keep your gift budget in balance
This year's leading candidate is the most amazing toy iPad, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX wheels for $99 and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 bead ropes or approximately 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy dealers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Whole Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was working; this year's technological toys have much more energy at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to the previous years.
While there were relatively fewer new toys with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increased, as is the number of toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All listed prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases which are otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
At one push, the animal gives a tone and the other press starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animatrical doll from Elmo Live Technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk on a moonlit walk with its innovative folding leg with a lock-up wheel.
Kids test Mickey's dance instructor toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn a car ride into fun with working with a self-repair, funny workbook.
If you're looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with simple use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in Leapfrog's Leapfrog series, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years of age) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on an SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from the age of 8) is a set of five cubes that are no bigger than a matchbox, each of which has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing dice in line before time runs out; it is great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example the Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years of age), which contains a coin with hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle animal.
A little bigger than your toothbrush brush brush is Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years old), the latest in a series of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's funny when you make a maze out of cubes and see if he can find a way out.
It's also very durable.
Ours was able to fall with the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
The introduction of more subtle police control in China
As an urban military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders in a semi-vocal manner with military authority.
He wanted female members - China's valiant urban order enforcers, feared and despised for their hard procedures and predilection for violence - to convey a certain impression of a bunch of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood at attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted by ruler.
The four headgear fit perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look mediocre," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city has ordered new recruits to have a college education.
Guangdong Province has turned grey-green uniforms into supposedly more attractive blue.
In Central China, Wuhan replaced strong-armed views: in 2009, 50 officers were reported to have surrounded the snack cart admittedly and stared at the owners until the door-to-door seller packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main painting.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The goal is to show apart from the rough side of the police also a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson himself would be in trouble to get into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the municipal decree, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But China's media commonly captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province beat an unattended spectator to death after using his cell phone to film, as they did in the process of protesting the landfill.
Last year there was training of police officers in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, there was a description of how to effectively beat up offenders without signs of blood.
This year, a watermelon merchant in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered an injury to the left side of the brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded online, depicts Chinese cops attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, cried last year after another discussion on tactics.
On paper it said "really thoroughly cleaned."
Skeptics say that approach is not enough.
After the county advertised eight new female policemen in October, the editorial of The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district called for female applicants aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the mean - i.e. higher than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
The functionalists say that work is mentally too demanding for women over the age of 25.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed policeman on Rednet.com, as if a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the character and "internal quality."
Women are like flower vases, said and added, "Besides being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City Board, is not in favour of this description.
But he pointed out that college requirements in China are also common for other jobs, both sexes.
As is the request for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the question of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
The disability or mutilation is certainly not applicable.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchback to serve with us," said Mr Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrolling Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her coworker with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than simply driving traders into alleys where they can perform their activities.
Every morning, a group stands up against more than ten market players running on foot or on wheels trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they're driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, when the market man started running, and for a while he left his bike with a noodle cart.
The police describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female policemen don't have the authority as their male counterparts so that the sellers can confiscate the goods.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leader.
The trend is then to protect them from the sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumors had spread that the police had killed the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or torched.
So far, Xindu has escaped this kind of violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers were on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The police confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the shop, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could cry like he wanted.
A 15-minute distance from the police officers, looking angry, with elbows against the vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator attached to a male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female policemen, coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only a helping role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and image cleaning.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li factually.
"Most of the time, it's the public that's going to mess with it."
The prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
The Attorney General's office cleared Senator John Ensigne of the criminal charges concerning his affair with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, and the lawyers announced on Wednesday to the senator.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican, faced, and who, until the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican candidate for president for 2012. His affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said that he was "pleased" by a decision that followed almost an annual investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action with the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the object of the investigation and that it was not intended to press further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published in the New York Times in October 2009 said that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, provide a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after they employed Mr Hampton to lobby for them, so much to be said in documents and interviews.
As Hampton was, until recently, Mr. Ensigne's assistant, he was expelled from the lobbying law of his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that was published "it became clear that this was a clear case of the preparation of a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are under investigation by the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensigno, Mr Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said that the Ministry was careful in political actions, after a large number of failures, including the decision of last year to suspend the action against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of a charge of misconduct by the state's attorney.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Liability and Ethics Organization in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group that filed several complaints against Mr Ensigne on the subject.
"It basically points to the fact that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensigne's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a call from the Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the Ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in the Wednesday statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins has refused to clarify the legal arguments he has made to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable describing the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop an investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethical group is accusing the parents of Ensign Hamptons of a $96,000 violation of federal electoral law.
The Election Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr Ensign helped Mr Hampton find lobbying work was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that, after Mr Hampton started acting as a lobbyist in the company, the head of Mr. Ensigne's staff - John Lopez - was communicating with Mr Hampton and told him that he "banged" into the Ministry of the Interior regarding the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also attended lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr Hampton for lobbying.
When the first news of the affair appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After several months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to take part in the third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of an investigation into a crime by his spokesman Jennifer Cooper, he said that the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the Justice Department quickly and end the investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she said.
The invitation from Cheshire village turns to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the courtroom.
A minute after a minute, they sent reports of horrific testimony over Twitter.
In the end, the defense says that over 140,000 Twitter reports were concerned with raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, there was a trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, and was to be officially terminated with the death penalty that the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by major reporters - created a "circus atmosphere," and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then introduced the jury in a decision in terms of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to question whether, with the advent of new technologies, new rules in the courtroom also require.
"As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of the fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr Hayes' chief defender.
The judge of the trial of Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claim concerning the return of last week and that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognised that reporting notorious cases may raise questions about justice.
In a court order of 1966, the United States Supreme Court annulled the conviction of a Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that Sheppard versus Maxwell, in a media trial, it was a "carnival atmosphere."
Some believe that this crime was an inspiration to the television show and the film "Fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts, which reviewed Hayes' judgment half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary, which determine the way in which the courts communicate, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was done arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courts may make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of Mr Hayes' many outlines, who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
For example, the defenders also claim that in the case of Mr Hayes, this may be bigotry when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the response of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos of terror when choosing the jury.
Some of the jurors reported that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims that became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defenders claim that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of the prosecutors, and that by his decision he incorrectly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The judges weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the magnitude of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They argued in their objection to the verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of the candidate for governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media was constantly fueling the flames of emotion in this case.
"A daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in court," wrote the lawyer, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the later reports, and from their point of view, the judicial police should be in charge of the scope of further processes.
But some lawyers have asked the appeals courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling on Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the scope of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was remarkable with its insults and negativity, a small amount of courtesy has emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of genuine cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to party fighting in the capital?
President Obama's and parliamentary leaders' deliberations on Tuesday have not produced any major discoveries on the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the sitting.
In any case, however, this was a polite discussion dealing with two parties' differences of opinion, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party engagement.
The Wednesday public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close synergies over a few months have created mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it's kind of hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they are probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience for a renewed party war.
That is why Tuesday's negotiations and its later evaluation by participants were carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to propose a rapid change in the circumstances that have existed for the last two years.
Whether it is a question of taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, Washington prepared the November election at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"Those are inevitable after the election.
Elections sparked the party's emotions and then they fell silent.
It's good. "
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax reduction has expired at the end of the year, and no one thinks that this is favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot see how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while rejecting unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's negotiations at the White House, there is already greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties when the 112th Congress is convened on January.
Rather, there is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that must be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that courtesy will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely linked to the compilation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act according to their promises and reduce government spending and abolish the new health care law.
These adversarial lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reform of the tax code and increasing some taxes, increasing the retirement age and reducing spending.
Joint Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the hardest tasks in Washington and, in their view, have put pressure on the deficit issue on the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus to fight to get as close to this number as possible.
The greatest resistance is among the elected jury officials who suggest that, at least today, we have a small foundation or will for compromise in the case of financial issues.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to address the budget, tax and health care, when a period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is much evidence that, despite the party nature of the last election, most Americans want to continue to see two parties working together.
If it could be directed towards the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will follow the public's reactions very closely.
Anyone facing a reduction in votes is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
That may be an optimistic view of the matter.
Stronicality and guidance are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a greater ideological gap has been created between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than was the case with Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
The disclosed American document depicts Moscow as the refuge of corruption.
The city's management is in the hands of "kleptocracy," and it continues with part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February's records.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding wing protection to help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal businesses, but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the administration's vertical - will take its own when money starts to move up the ladder.
The record that was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accused him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but since then, we can only monitor minimal changes in cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have been constantly denying allegations of corruption for many years, and has won several lawsuits for false charges for such allegations.
In September, he said at the Russian television station when he was asked about a proven testimony about corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's crap."
The Russians, with absolute conviction, believe that if their society is corrupt, it will prove to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details in such a way, namely in the embassy report, and it is also outrageous that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The Government of Moscow and its links with the criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional' and confirm that the government acts more as a kleptocracy than a government," says the report.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krisha' (term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means' roof 'or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Prosecutor's Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts identified and three-degree structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and Militia are at level two."
"Finally, at the lowest level, there are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in empty seats in some areas, as the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies, and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "shop owners in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (rather than from organised criminal groups), because they have not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the mood."
The record says that while the collection of money is complex, protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their business is closed under various pretext.
Medvedev spoke several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report talks about men taking suitcases, probably loaded with cash, to Kremlin himself.
"Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats in his fight against corruption," said George Satarov, director of Moscow's Indian research team in a recent interview.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year nationwide.
Countries rank 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by Transparency International (countries ranging from at least to the most corrupt).
Uncovering the report of the US embassy, which appeared in Moscow not until late in the evening, certainly did not inspire enthusiasm from the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov may be accused of Moscow's shortcomings, it may be a possibility for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin said that the documents WikiLeaks published might have been forgeries and reacted angrily to a statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is our synergy, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, such coercion, you know, so unethical."
The Red Khmer veterans are forced to deal with the past.
In a scrupulously illuminated concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the head of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "butcher" for his rudeness during the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this remote hold of the Khmer Rouge in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty has been compromised in Anlong Vengu, too.
In April, victims at the forum of truth and reconciliation were allowed to confront publicly the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, together, the UN and the Cambodia Court of First Conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the sentencing of a former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With every such advancement, there was growing unrest among the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating efforts to reconcile and their attempts to rejoin Cambodian society.
"There is hatred and fear among the former Khmery Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"To them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the regime of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or died of hunger, disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the regime's remnants and his soldiers fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they began an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara led guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of West Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, after the UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their benefactors no longer cared for them, most of the former Red Khmer fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgic reminders of the times of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Reds have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people had little benefit from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of making a deal."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"The Mok has fed everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we must ensure everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Red Court has also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court has a mandate to prosecute leaders and people responsible for crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in the Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project on which thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
A recent steam evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to his wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared across the arid grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her in, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace and stability in Cambodia," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer's circumstances means gluing broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre published the first textbook approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and the title "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connection of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more difficult and more difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks, and the court are starting to have influence, he communicated further.
The Khmer Reds still have a powerful spell here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains mountains, the road is covered with weeds and dumped plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, cell phone salesman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, many of the local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to be stockpiling uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would give up their supplies of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the Security Summit of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the US government has tried to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed to have come across the stumbling block last spring.
But American officials have told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a few classified operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about £500, according to an official who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of the Obama 47th National Summit on Nuclear Safety in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to a follow-up summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Partnership for Global Security, the Nuclear Safety Groups.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their reserves of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Safety Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago and showed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to the removal of Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, reported by officials.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1 300 miles to a Russian facility for storage and disposal, said officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, said officials.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to deliver less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on a trust basis," which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
This year, the James Martin Nuclear Non-Proliferation Center estimated that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium applicable to the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the Joint Declaration, seek to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome the progress made on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis of improved relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government didn't play hard to get with CIA flights.
The Spanish Government has not done anything expensive about CIA flights transporting imprisoned Taliban and Al-Qaid members to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, as stated in its telegram by a United States envoy in Madrid.
This follows from the documents provided by Wikileaks daily El País, where it also states that the former first representative of Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus show that she had proper supervision of foreign aircraft passing through Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, in which a dozen states, including Spain, were accused of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe communication 'removed Zapatero's government' and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no problem with secret service flights through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "caught unprepared," says Aguirre in one of the documents.
The then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the American ambassador that the Spanish Government "wanted to give the matter as little as possible, but, by being in the hands of the judges, the Cabinet had limited influence '.
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he is concerned, he did not intend to block the initiative of the judge to request the disclosure of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information contains no incriminated file or sensitive information," explained the Embassy after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US has expressed concern over "obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the disclosure of information from CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to solve this case discreetly between governments," Regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they think is appropriate," he has already instructed his colleagues, "to avoid heated comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the conduct of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - footnote.) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular Party will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that the Zapater government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the US, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States Government," notes.
The confessed mother-killer complained on the network of maternal "worries"
A young woman spoke of a child when it was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror after Galician."
Monica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname, which she used since she was a little girl, she communicated with her cousin and at least once a friend; both of them are from the village of Noia in La Corunya, where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, you need to know the woman's emotional life, which the ABC journal reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if the newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She had a new acquaintance soon.
His chosen man was Alberto, a young man from the nearby city of Lousam.
It took a long time for them to live together.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her in Palma for a week.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's on her own at Menorca, and she says, "Alberto's upset that I left for work."
"When I told him, he thought it was good, but now he realizes that he has to be with the baby all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about a text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address of where to send your baby."
He's complaining, "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his place of residence, "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only staying until the 19th, because I have to go to work for the 20th so I don't lose the job."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son in.
"He will be with whom he is to be with, I mean me, and never again will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention, given her bad relationships.
There's another contribution in July.
When he dials this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived at the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on one side, but he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He'll go to summer school, so I'll save some money for the nanny."
The seventeenth of greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you what videos to e-mail, look how he wants to, meet me, sex is needed."
On the 30th, the next message: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a message about Victor, the current partner, "He gives me money."
On the Internet are Monique's contributions to anime and mansion blogs.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she used to call herself "Muki ex-inmate."
"Terror by Galician (motto)."
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Palma provincial discipline yesterday, where she came from the Menorca detention center.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened, and "she had no intention of hurting the little one."
Before that, however, she admitted that she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
The defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric examination.
People would get 4 seats in the House and the PSC would lose 9 mandates.
with the results of November 28, PP could have the lead in the councils in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (the People's Party of Catalonia) already has the idea of universal elections, whether they increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually like that once compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, Catalan people gained 610.473 votes in the general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384.091 votes.
If this tendency to increase is maintained, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and by the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party have calculated that if the general elections are held, the PPC could obtain 12 Members in the House against the current 8, party CiU (Convergencia i Unió, Czech Shoda and Union - note above) would also obtain 4 mandates (now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is essential for PP and PSOE (the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one Member - now it has 3 - while the ICV would continue to have one mandate or another.
However, according to the election calendar, the next meeting will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the popular people could also have a decisive influence on the end of socialist domination in four major provincial cities, as well as on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euro for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the folk agree that the PSC could lose the City Hall in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive the majority and would not even be able to contact their traditional allies, the parties to the ERC and the ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona administration - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
PP increased the number of votes raised in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe they could play a major role in the turn in Tarragon, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
People have also acquired in other important councils such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
currently PP is represented at 34 councils in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda.
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerians, who had been detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which provided passports for various Al Qaeda groups, among which were also "Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam 'or" Lashkar-e-Taiba', while the latter was the author of bombings in Mumbai, where 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, with the aim of "Operation Kampai" to ensure the weakening of Al-Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus at international level and thus to "reduce its operational capabilities."
Investigators estimate that this cell may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years when it was active in Catalonia, where it was then forged and then delivered to groups that form Al Qaeda's criminal galaxy so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police forces, apart from the Thai services, participated in these investigations, and it cannot therefore be excluded that other European countries will not have similar interventions in the coming days, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In the context of this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were developed in Thailand.
It was these men who were driving a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network, the part of which was destroyed in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between 25 and 45 years of age, they had to be valid for several years and they had to be free of marked visas.
The investigation documents point out that there are no facts yet linking the detainees from Catalonia to the bombing in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba," should have been one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency of about a thousand dollars, which were "inserted" to purchase cards into mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have already confiscated a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) is demanding that Mass stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia), Alicia Sánchez-Camach, had the opportunity yesterday to present personally to Arthur Maso his terms of reference, under which he is willing to support his appointment as President of the Generalitat; these terms are identical to those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is the recovery of the economy and the renunciation of risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the leader of nationalists intends to propose during his mandate.
The chair of the Catalan People's Party came to a meeting with Arthur Maso with a certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in last Sunday's elections, which is more than satisfactory to gain popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when the general elections are held, but so far the talks that Mas and the rest of the political leaders are taking place in the Catalan spirit.
As far as President PP is concerned, in order to get her support for her appointment, "she will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches," as well as an economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque Country - that CiU's leader even wanted to put to the vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slimmer the bloated political apparatus of the autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the appointment of Mas will be dealt with by PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and is today meeting with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric establishment assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of the "lack of measures"
The show of the Olot center does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to illustrate the damage caused to the institution of the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - in the meantime was employed here - killed at least 11 seniors in his custody.
The director of this home for the elderly Joan Sal came along with a lawyer at the facility, a lawyer at Joan Canada, and announced that "the wish of La Caritat would be to press charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "the legality and responsibility commit us to leave this process to the competent authorities."
In addition to the damage to the reputation that this institution may suffer because it did not reveal in time the criminal activities of the caregiver, the major threat to La Caritat's home is now the claims for material compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight elderly clients with the suspicion that, in many cases, the deceased had not been examined personally by any doctor, but that - given the age and poor health of patients - everything was handled over the phone.
Yesterday, La Caritat, through its Director, resolutely rejected this extravagance and stressed that "the lack of measures could in no way have been the cause of what happened."
La Caritat added that "there are no indications in the case that any third party has committed an error in addition to the defendant himself '.
A man now known as the "Angel of Death" admitted 11 deaths yesterday and stated that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, death was caused by administration of too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of soothing tablets.
Director La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff access to medical supplies.
Insulin and a cocktail of tranquilizers were likely in six cases out of the nine devices used by this caregiver to kill patients in his attempt to relieve their suffering.
However, only the analyses currently taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is lying and was actually seeking less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killing them with lye, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims, nor do they rule out the fact that the number of people killed may be higher than the number he confessed to, and they justify their behavior in the various versions that Villa put in court knowing that she must change her actions when it became apparent that he killed eight people.
That is why they say that they want to be available to the judiciary in order to shed light on the whole scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Yesterday, investors responded sharply to yesterday's threat to President Trichet of the European Central Bank, who pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The peripheral differentials have been closed by force, and European banks' shares have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market, which, although falling, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It's gonna take the investor some time to lose his concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank called for an end to the government debt redemption plan for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and to leave unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to predict "at least until March" and to comply with a three-month licitation with unlimited access to the end of this trimester in order to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and that they will even announce its intensification.
If they fail to meet the expectations created, they will re-create the reaction of yesterday's markets, and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity rate, God is with us!
It was the same at the May convention, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, an armored fist announced it on Monday and on Wednesday it said that it had already purchased many, causing another market collapse.
Last night's one-year-old exchange-rate quote in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood of the market following Tricheta.
In Ireland the figures were published representing losses Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent around 10.000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15.000, with a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the problem has not been revealed by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the Auxiliary Plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need the approval of the new budget by Parliament, and it still does not have sufficient support, so uncertainty remains in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has reduced the tone of her speech to ease the tension in her face for the next EU summit on 14 December, on which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a Union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to restore employment - to investors' ears, this sounds like the Four Seasons from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish exchange increased by 4.5%, twice that of other European exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was rapid and convincing - we seem to benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key regret for a three-year bond, which will be favoured by Trichet, which, we hope, will result in great demand for it, which will help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - there's 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - plus high rates, and access to markets would shut us down sine die.
However, the strategy of Cesare's wife must continue to be used - "not only to be that, but also to be that."
We can do this.
The President of the Eulen Group will attack the negotiations of Vega Sicilia requested by his children.
The storm in the open conflict in the family of Álvarez, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not calm down.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will, after considering him to be "completely insignificant," challenge El Enebro's legal conduct planned for the 16th of this month and the required five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and take over Bodegas Vega Sicilia's prosecutors with the help of the administrative authorities.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José fine-tune the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over controlling part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not seem willing to relinquish his dispute over membership of the ruling bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven descendants were removed from its Administrative Committee, who were appointed leaders during the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The proceedings of the El Enebro group planned for the 16th of this month, which were convened by commercial court official number 2 in Madrid, restored the rumours in the womb of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means to guarantee that the commission is convened until the dispute is resolved.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira Álvarez in Mezquirizz is considered by David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of judicial deceit and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of 18 January, which was completely invalid."
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying a legal challenge to this conduct as "completely irrelevant."
The protagonists themselves, who have been discreetly silent, have tried without success to call a hearing in June.
In El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right to use 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when examining the issue of the court assault, and the date of the hearing has not yet been established.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes real-time improvements in vehicles.
Since Red Bull invaded Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this extraordinary world of speed is characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new arrival team, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on Ferrari Fernando Alonso's triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in Formula 1 - a "secret weapon" that the multiethnic Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulating marches that was launched by a German company in 2007 for the purposes of a very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for high precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thereby avoiding unnecessary errors and expenditure.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this software device allowed the Red Bull team to perform "within a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements that will otherwise be detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 they employed on average 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
The Red Bull team is today working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles, except for an engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features shall be modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and high technology autoclaves.
The only limit on this technical option is $40 million, which represents the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period of time to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech race about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings, which are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that's going on here is considered a "big secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull is in Formula 1, no doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
But other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, are hiding behind the immense technological means that the brand of energy drinks has placed in its participation in racing circuits.
The head of production technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed 50% to the victory, and the rest was due to riders.
currently this ratio has changed, and technology is worth 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 its own shops in cooperation with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with its business partner Pont Reyes festively opened its first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 80-100 sqm shops planned to be opened in Spain in the following two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of Spain's HP Helena Herrera presented as an example of a newly rebuilt shop on Barcelona's Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 sales places in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first shops were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the shop in Barcelona is third.
Herrera did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following.
Herrera, who also runs HP personnel systems, has assured that the philosophy of opening shops will still be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises on the exclusive design of shop equipment (products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of business personnel.
Helena Herrera denied that it was franchising and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aimed at "improving customer service, small and medium-sized enterprises' services when purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging."
Trade in Barcelona is part of the pilot pioneer program at world level, which aims to address any problems with computer devices in the warranty.
Online service is connected with a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"We will be able to solve problems within 10 minutes that may otherwise last up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, since large companies already have a technical assistance contract service," Helena Herrer pointed out yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on stealing a million clients from his competitors in three years.
More optimistic than other bosses, a delegate member of the board of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
Nevertheless, they expect interest rates to be reduced, but they will try to compensate by lowering bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to get a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
In addition to surviving without having to turn to public aid at FROB, the aim is to gain market share by capturing millions of new private clients - 700,000, respectively, if those who eventually leave the bank - since up to now the Institute has been pampering with small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share for private clients is 3.5%, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of plan 2011-2013 is a commitment to productivity, or can also be said to be sobriety, in order to reduce the costs that the Bank will show when presenting the results for the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare set targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all world banking plans.
Sabadell will close his Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIA meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important."
Indeed, it believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain will "be lengthy."
In addition, in two or three years' time it will be "very difficult to create employment," which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And, while they believe that passive war - which reduces margins - is retreating, the price of the risk premium that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus compensating for the reduction in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will constitute a pressure factor for loans'.
"We haven't closed the faucet yet, but the differentials are very high," acknowledged Guardiol.
Banesto has already issued orders to his network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking "now is to reduce commissions," but there is a "competitive framework."
The strategic plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not in vain, it assures that in Spain, "greater sizes will be required."
"He won't stay on the stone next year," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "greatly reduced" and does not exclude any Spanish institution from entering between the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can substitute fund collection on the market before a new capital measure.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive temporary market closures, the serious problem remains what some bankers are predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what was done in June, short-term financing can be obtained by means of repo rates, which reduces the crisis.
CECA eliminates another wave of savings banks' mergers
The CEO of CECA refused yesterday that there should be another wave of savings banks' mergers, and again insisted on the speed at which the reorganisation of the sector is carried out.
When the process of pooling Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, yesterday, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Sparkasse KölnBonn (CECA), ruled out a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be regarded as a second round, what is happening are conventions."
"Most are completely executed; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this matter," noted the Director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of Directors and Executive Officers of Aragon - note:), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process took place "at the highest possible speed, and we must be very satisfied as recorded in the instalments that, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank," he stressed.
"Moving from 45 savings banks with an average volume of assets of 28.000 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that does not have a comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that they are larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty," he underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of less fortunate views on the slowness of the process," which show a "lack of seriousness and understanding," because "what the Bank of Spain does is a reminder that we have to be on the deadline before the end of the year."
Yesterday, CECA's CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured that Spain had the strictest financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed "a lack of knowledge to those who question it."
The Director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks as well as the system that has managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues with "the highest possible speed."
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has set conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, to the regulation of private intermediation agencies, to the abolition of 426 euros for unemployed people, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic control - note), the airport manager Barajas and El Prat, and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, supported by former Prime Minister Felipe González, has, on the other hand, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How do you interpret these movements?
Let us be clear in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is supposed to be, which comes across the idea of adhering to old traditions, which is held by a large proportion of other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area that would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although it may now appear to be Scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is to rework the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigour, fines for guilty states, possible deferral of payments for some of them, and to extend the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time now, so there is no room for spin now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission fueled deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from doing so from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany thought was right (fiscal rigour and public finance stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel was painfully delaying the decision to rescue Greece.
It was already the subject of strong criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel has once again appeared with a clear opinion, demanding to reform the European Union's conventions in order to enable the rescue of a Member State while at the same time obliging private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as being anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although somewhat mitigated, has been approved, and we should monitor the Union's reform process over the coming months, which should allow for these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has set a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures must now be taken, with which it seems to disagree too much, from this date, the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which rule-breakers are severely sanctioned and can be forced to announce deferral, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is telling us that we need to take a strict path of growth with an increase in savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and construction, with huge balance of payments gaps, which it ruled in the years of Spain's boom, is simply not to be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would have made a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just a reopening of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they're asking us to do is much harder.
And worst of all, under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulence will replace more calm.
And that we would take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting with the large businesses of last Saturday and the announcement of the new measures yesterday) shows that, despite the criticisms to Merkel, the way of thinking that things need to be put in order has opened up.
However, the red line that Germany has laid out is here, and it does not seem to want to move it.
And out of the possibilities that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of less serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumventing the rules
The tricks that Alonso and Ramos pulled in the fight with Ajax show wit not intent to escape punishment.
The supposed elimination of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League game against Ajax on November 23 has caused a sea of ink to be written on whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behaviour and whether or not UEFA should eventually punish both football players.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had clearly won), the appointed players deliberately wasted time one by one when the foul was to be played in order to provoke the judge, and he showed them the other yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid leading their group - and will be able to continue to the next stage, stripped of the cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Board gave coach José Mourinho a two-game penalty, and the guilty players were fined.
The provocation of a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, which is rules that are unwritten, but are being watched.
Part of the discussion in this case arose because of the fact that Real Madrid (which boasts generosity and honor in its anthem, and which has already fined its players for similar acts), and it seems also because of the drama led by Mourinh, who thus adds another episode to his long history of comedy and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether there is circumvention of law in these acts; indeed, it is actions that respect the rules of sport, which, however, seem to be trying to circumvent their purpose.
It is a question of what kind of damage such negotiations cause to the sports spirit.
One of the essentials of sporting behaviour is the physical integrity of the opponents, which has not been violated in these cases, or there has been no violent play.
Another of these elements that characterize a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over their team because of their misdemeanor - which did not happen here either.
Thus, the paradox of Real Madrid's action is that there was not what we normally characterise as a ruse or circumvention of law, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should have been as obvious as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited, and they were happy to get the punishment.
But the next question is what advantage the guilty of their intentional misdemeanor will have.
It must be noted here that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that he will not gain any advantage in the current game, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And that's not even a useful strategy until the next game, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
Obviously, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the future game.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first sight, the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by doing so, players will be punished, and they will go to the second round of cards in which one card is sufficient to rule out is less than the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sport spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will make it possible to obtain maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case that we are dealing with here, players did not aim to avoid the punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between wits and bypassing the rules is not clear, I believe that it was clearly wits in this case.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two separate goodbyes and because of the way in which the transmission of instructions to provoke them from the leadership took place.
Damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Combating offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictate concentrates this year on the avalanche of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are rapidly increasing.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December again pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in a fight to obtain clients by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on food, they agree with the entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
In order to complete the complication of the numbers, this year's calendar (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated requests for a week from December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for peak days (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when skinny years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay their own spending at parties.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of load capacity, the president of the Gremi de Restaurant de Barcelona Restaurant Association, Gaieta Farras.
At the moment, the representative of the restaurant's patronage does not dare predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will think twice before making a reservation."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to the subject of prices, they're careful," he adds.
Business will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price," he says and reminds that thanks to the crisis customers tend to go down a step and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
The survey at various facilities shows that the biggest strain of booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
The Soteras group reports a real booking boom for this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, which are adapted to the menu offered, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
In another important company, which is Andilana, which includes 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought a special feature of this year's calendar of more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have made both possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, each of which should be chosen, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros," they state.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have seen profits increase since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The resources of this company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day, as pre-Christmas celebrations will take place among friends.
they added a Christmas menu to their six group menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded the guest's tendency to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - note:).
They also noticed that companies are already showing up to invite their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is a little bit larger.
The Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) believes that Enric Goma is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "revived," although clients "negotiate to the maximum."
Even during Christmas celebrations, this impression did not budge, no matter who pays, to point out.
Pakistan's nuclear program spawned great unrest in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a "faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary unrest that is causing the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and important details they offer regarding the content of communications and ideas of North American diplomacy representatives in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety rather than increasing, "is in decline," and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The specificity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored in pieces to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in one of the reports before the visit of the former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
An increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and missile programmes are no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as spreading and as a reason to be vigilant.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or missile programmes," said Yuri Korolev, an expert from the Russian State Department, at a meeting with his counterparts from the US.
The biggest news of the documentation published by Julian Assange's server is the ever-lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
The message issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," states: "Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unresponsive or rejected."
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington, during the visit to General Ashfaq Kayani's army, to "make it very clear" that the "Pakistani army must put an end to the silent support of terrorist groups."
The hunt for Chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking operative responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red call" in order to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced a "special call," the so-called red notice, to "locate and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Moreover, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the counsel assures the creator Wikileaks Mark Stephens that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang."
It was November 20, when the International Police Corps based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received authorisation from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions for the identification or location of Assange "in order to place a temporary link on it and issue it '.
Although Interpol cannot order detention of the person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notice to be capable of making an arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when states have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be located.
This move has upset Assenge's lawyers, who yesterday published writing, claiming that the thirty-nine-year-old founder Wikileaks has shown willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of their case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentij Pavlovich Berijou, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal pursuit," says the letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother is defending the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but she is not silent.
On Monday, he provided an interview with the editor of Time magazine via Skype from an unknown location - in this interview he demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to carry out espionage at the UN in violation of the international conventions signed by the United States," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he declared for CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking operative responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding to Assange is in contrast to what conservative politicians and commentators say these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will chair the Lower House National Security Committee from January onwards, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks as terrorist organisations "in order to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, has gone on to say that Assange should be "killed," which he then had to call off.
"Obama should put a bounty on him or use an unmanned plane or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist priest, former Governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for president.
"Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for the leak has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," said Fox Station
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "winking" on the follower Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its stay.
Huguet proposes more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for fighting the already several internal revolt in the ERC ranks (the Left Republican Party of Catalonia - note:), no result due to the loss of 11 Members and half the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture of resignation seems to be insufficient for former leader Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot be as concerned as he had with other degraded currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms by blinking, which will help him to get armored into the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee would be able to secretly comment on his stay in office.
With ballots, not by raising your hand.
If Carod's supporters wish to give the President a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid dissolution and subjecting himself.
in several interviews, he argued that he would not be regarded as having been confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added without specifying the percentage that there would also be no good result "after Bulgaria."
Carod's followers demand more than to give his office - which they regard as a gesture of no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest authority on the slopes.
But given that they do not have enough majority to enforce the demise, they will try to make an executive reminder of the plan from now until May.
As a result, they expect to participate in the drafting of a document on strategic reorientation, on which the management will put the National Council to the vote on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move Congress in autumn 2011.
The ERC leader has declared that "multifaculties" harms stability, and that his aim is that once and for all the organization should be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, there seems to be a prominent article signed by current advisor Joseph Huguet on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós' ideologist, this innovation advisor took the final decision that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals."
And he named them five, two of which stand out.
The first is the "overwriting" of the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means also involving new faces that are from a sector that is inclined to Carod.
The second target can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should put an end to the meeting industry as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights to reform the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by voting.
The end of the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercos team, which has already fought on the last two slopes in this respect.
However, the 2008 cramped assembly decided that the meeting industry had to be assessed at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the Party has discouraged the solution to this matter.
Now, without the looming critical sectors, it might be a good time to revisit this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for November; 390 for 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico experienced a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as stated by MILENIO.
Between the murders, three female cases and the discovery of a couple of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico stand out.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are 390 murders in Mexico, possibly linked to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim sustained at least three gunshot wounds, a mercy wound to the head, and had hands and legs bound by rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, in the Naucalpan district.
Early on Thursday, November 4, the co-workers discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal chest shots off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the district of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a report signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered in Zahualcoyotl by eight shots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two victims were killed in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony in the Ecatepec district by a gunshot wound to the head.
In Chalco, on a remote road in the El Naranjo colony, a dead man was found shot in the forehead, and under the body was found a shell casing from a 25-caliber gun.
parts of the human body were found in the waste water channel in the Playa Golondrina colony.
The rescue services did a thorough search for other parts of it, but they didn't find them.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlan reported a body found with their hands tied back and their heads wrapped in the place of Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapan de Zaragoza was reported, and there were also reports of death threats among the victims.
A day later, she was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz county cardboard box, which contained a human head.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the Zoquiapan settlement in Ixtapaloca County, and the next morning, a man was found murdered in Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellow and blue sheet, which was provisionally reported to be left by the killers at his body, identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaloca, a woman with no signs of life was found in the San Francisco Acuautla settlement with two blows to the back of the head.
On the skin of the woman was discovered the tattoo of the sacred figure Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - note:) and also necklaces with her portrait.
At the end of the month, a dead man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in a car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found wrapped in tape and there was also a message in the village of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
With the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations that said, "This is what happens to those who do not adapt."
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, carrying signs of torture, and her limbs were tied, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in the San Agustín Colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Zahualcoyotl.
The first one was beheaded and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with tape and left with a message; while the second one was tortured and found in plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
They found an agent and a note with him.
China adheres to its objective of reducing greenhouse gases
At the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP16 assured that its country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and stated that it insists on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country has already invested $245 million in the last four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But it has made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this with the international community.
He reported that China's strategy on climate change issues is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
On all these points, he has already made progress, including the approval last year of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
He also stressed that in China, the federal authorities collaborated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he said, various multi-year plans are in operation or have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese Government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is, as he said, an Energy Efficiency Programme that has been introduced over the last five years and has received investments from the UN, the Government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also under way, followed by a project to exchange fluorescent lamps for saving bulbs and a project to mitigate and adapt.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's climate change expert advisor, assured China's efforts were greater than it is generally thought.
For example, he described greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while 100 tonnes in the United States; China is responsible for 9% of its historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and it expects it to make further progress by 2020.
Espin Exclusion: Caesar Nava enacted
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - note:) stated that the former Chairman of this party is entitled to apply to the National Order Commission of his law.
The National Chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos has been enacted and that the former President of that party is entitled to contact the National Order Commission and demand his right.
In an interview which was held before the objection was made by the governor of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that Espin's expulsion was in any case a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to refer to him by complaint to the National Council Order Committee in order to be a decision taken by a competent authority," he added.
He also explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that it has never been at the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN would emerge from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was an intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he pointed out.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue were behind his party, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary we benefit from it and strengthen us," he added.
He said that the committee could elect the best president or president that the PAN deserves for the next three years without question, so he would pass on the relay to "whom the committee will appoint."
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of the five I proudly hand over to the President of the Party."
He predicted that the rise observed by the party in the last July elections would be reflected in future joules, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloa, will be the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and desires are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to these expectations."
When we asked him about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, note.)) because of his speeches within the four years he ruled, César Nava invited PRI members to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderon, then let them defend them to get out of their shell," he testified.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during his speech in the National Auditory, because there is no use for gagging or censorship in this country.
Obama is promoting a law on Twitter to support students with no papers
"If you think approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve it," the US president tweeted on a popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama joined the National Mobilization in support of the Dream Act by contributing to his personal account of the Twitter Social Network, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and insist that they approve it," said Obama.
His short report draws attention to an Internet link to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on this law is imminent.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless the extension of the Bush era tax reduction and government funding was approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and on other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesperson said that he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the matter of taxes before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement on this and then we can plan the order of other matters, "he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a 'vote to close the debate' on the Dream Act, so that the proposal to legalize students without documents could be put to the vote in the Senate from next Thursday, although more likely next week.
The Senate approval of the Dream Act, or the "American Dream" Act, would legalize around 800,000 young people who had entered the United States before the end of 16 years, have stayed in the country for the last five years and have been admitted to an institution of higher education or military service.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so that its supporters' organisations are carrying out intensive agitation to ensure that this bill is passed.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said that he will vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has expressed his support for this law.
That is why followers of the Dream Act need to acquire several Republicans in case other democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters most negotiate are the senators from Maine Olympia Snow and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida, George Lemieux, who supplemented Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they said that they will not support him next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has yet to comment at the moment.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning towards a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature inserts the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga," translated "insert the finger into the wound" is the equivalent of Czech "hit the nail on the head - note:
The second round of the cycle The pleasure of the language was the promenade, where the participants presented the literary gala performances
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... A finger in the wound? What is expected of me?," asked the author Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to begin the second round of The Pleasure of Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair they were devoted to the subject of Sex in Language at the round table, explained).
The finger "brings us to a close," the lovely Argentine writer spoke to the audience, composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the round table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and attended by Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monter and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text she gave Gonzal to Celori, which Schultz then referred to as a great story in which Luisa acted as a protagonist in the first person, who, in seeking knowledge of what the "wound" was, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she did not receive answers, although the traces of the same story did.
From an infectious patient, she goes, "patience is not my strong suit, it may be my wound."
In the end, after frustration with a traumatist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, he is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents the real opening and the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed softly and concluded that "she only managed to learn so much about the wound that it was really open and that it did not exist," but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language had to go hand in hand together.
Writer Valenzuel played both.
Nicaraguic Sergio Ramírez also performed with a delightful story which he called Praise the Invasion in which the finger is not named in the wound, but at one moment appears.
with the elements of magical realism he tells about the famous witch who played clouds, brought back the people who had gone far away, or corrected the virtue lost by one virgin, this narrative which then turned to speak to America, a great novel in which his own chroniclers, who had told it from the beginning, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, criticized the exaggeration of conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (writers), mocked at the fictional testimony presented in the stories as real, but in other ways never managed to tell the story of America with such imagery, which even lacked shame."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination," and just where reality and lie blend, where they no longer know what the story belongs to one group and what the other one reaches fictional literature at its peak.
This is indeed called the "Cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter stressed and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation to the International Book Fair with its "Finger in the Bash" enabled.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer has pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence that passes through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise, which is obviously not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical response."
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger to the wound of a writer bound by a writer."
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and the control of consciousness, which is overflowing with dogmatism, it is forgotten that "behind every attraction there is a small no and behind every denial is also a small yes."
"In order to be masters of our ideas and reality, we must color: and colour means many times putting a finger in the wound and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also harassing the authorities that prefer this black and white world," he spoke to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Ruben Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has already achieved on three occasions a decisive series.
In the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, two different styles will collide with their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Ruben Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has managed to reach a crucial series on three occasions, but until now, he has left with an incomplete one, which is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinean had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winner and played with the same team in a curious way the following final.
As a coach, the santistic strategist reached his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he held the reins of the Morelia Club, with which he succumbed to a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna Club in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Ruben once again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Smokers" (another nickname of the Club Deportivo Toluca - note:) after 210 minutes of the game indefinitely 2-2, after a series of penalty shots he got to the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but finally his three players missed out of 11 steps and thus the team suffered a turnover of 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that the institution is the most important to him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I owe, and the title would be of course for me, but the first is the most important," said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
in a live memory has a previous final, in which, as confirmed, he learned a lot, "we learned that until the referee has finished, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as players, because last time with two penalty cards, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we have learned that, until the match is over, we cannot celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series could make a decision in criminal shootings, he believes in his players: "You never try to make a series of penalty kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option, and we have to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were prepared, unfortunately, but fate has prepared a bad move for us, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it has left something in us, and hopefully this time it will not happen."
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other person and to taste the glory the titles bring.
The United States is amending the rules for issuing visas
People will have to contact the services centres for visa applicants before the interview at the Consultative Department; costs will be lower and waiting times will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the visa process will change at the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Service Centres (ASC in short) before the interview at the Consultative Department.
The ASC staff shall remove the applicant's biometric information and be evaluated by the Consultative Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer need to pay a fee for the appointment, the second for processing the application and another for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary staff visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Given that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who require a second interview with the Consultative Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the service of $26.

NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The American Space Agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for alien life.
The United States National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by astrobiology experts, a science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, propagation and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured her that she would present a "discovery that would cause a breakthrough in the search for alien life," which prompted speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that, apart from us, there are other creatures living in inhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable and that could represent the possibility that they may one day become intelligent creatures such as humans if the conditions in which they live are improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life because the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the probability that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is a different, second life form, different from the one we know."
The Cosmic Agency will announce the real range of discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who are examining Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón breed opposition "bloc"
The reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartisan," they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term was not even started when the opposition block, led by members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revolución Democracy, Czech "Party of the Democratic Revolution" - note.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Party of Labour" - note.), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda" note.) and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvev, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" into the House.
Before the beginning of the meeting at the beginning of the 60th parliamentary term Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "foiled" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, it begins with "bapartism," because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Britem by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - note:) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality at the initiative of the parties PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He stated that in the coming days they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they would again be subjected to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"When the opposition coalition came here, I looked at it, because we are excluded from any decision, not even having the willingness to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez stated by Convergencia that they are in agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and therefore they will form a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow Congress to continue, after being a monopoly, to be now "duopolous."
Aspiring the reform of the law is not to have endless bipartisms in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators, and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza by PT explained that Congress has now become the "prey" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"In the past, it was controlled by only one party, and today it is divided by two."
The Patron Montalvo asked that a Member's personality be respected so that he could be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order that the five Members who are likely to be nine, but now see us in five, do not stay out of the vaulted agreements, each in a different faction, we unite to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have created and agreed to, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
There's another 200,000 pesos coming out for "the supplier."
City Hall in Mazatlán will pay another check to the owner of the company supplying electricity.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent by City Hall to Lorenzo Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
Thus, the sum paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material will be increased to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the City Hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, was issued to the sum of 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject-matter was stated "compensation of outstanding payments."
The cashier Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, who was monitored by the High State Audit Office for high-priced sales, another sum.
What has not been said is the total amount that City Hall still owes her, and how many cheques will still be sent to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers, has been paid for," he said in one interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government List, as provided by the law in the case of companies examined by the High State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the treasurer has assured that it has not used the city hall's supplier's services again.
in the previous period, after 25 July, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camacha Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it cashed cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places urgently need maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor state of the Sánchez Taboada recital in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of foreign tourists into the deep end at the Sáncheze Taboada recital, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad condition and thus do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked for the impression of a destination, and the bad that tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the bad condition of the streets and pavements affects tourists who walk around here and see a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to shut down a business for a day, and they have no idea of the revenues that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these things for so long and without proper planning."
The operator José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
"The City Hall will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to deal with preventive maintenance, not just to correct existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy clean cities, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, we deserve a clean residence as well as a town hall should change its urban maintenance strategy. "
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, such as the Mazatlan Emblém and El Venadito (monument, statue of deer - note:).
"Today, in order for tourists to arrive, it is not only a matter of promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city with the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to all, maintenance is missing.
He talked about a number of places to put in order in cooperation with the city hall, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Ller Martínez, the subsecretary of the Tourist Graduation, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán was urgent because they were not used correctly and did not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural objectives and spaces, but they will need to be put in order first, so that we can put these places on the list that we have in order to promote this destination. "
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dadalos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take a great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary term full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive calls for the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is in convulsions and is facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, composed of seven political forces, 19 Members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencio and the last from the PVEM, includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and the various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic factors will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dáhalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 Members of Congress take a great responsibility and set an example on the way to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades for rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridging to move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do a decent job and, above all, be indebted to companies and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to take all the forces in an effort to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will encourage job creation in some ways. "
With regard to tourism, he asked for new legislators to give him greater weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing value and investment, which, moreover, is directly competing with agriculture."
In addition to giving money to start-up tourist projects, Congress should help to provide the state with certainty and help with the alcohol law that has not been resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for the Three Kings.
Dolls, cars and bicycles are on the children's wish list in the Coronado Valenzuel family together with other toys.
For their parents, it will be difficult for the coming Day of the Three Kings to meet their expectations, as their household contains exactly 12 people and one ram.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest residence in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we have a hard time because our husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... this afternoon I go out with" plebeys "on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for the ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a monster car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana would have wanted a dress size for one year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo) 'I wish this monster car', but I said to him 'we will see son' because it was very expensive ', remembers with the sadness of Cayetan.
For older kids who were just in school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, is a size 12, a ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, while 8-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing his sneakers, so he could really use a pair of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children of the Coronado Valenzuels family, you can participate in the "Three Kings Wanted" campaign, and at Noroeste's front desk to bring a gift or cash.
14 suspected drug traffickers who were arrested
Tens of tours were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the destruction of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used to manufacture drugs.
"Approximately 750 beds of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to produce were confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Quebec police.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, both believed to be heads of this entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
Arrested persons must have arrived at the Sherbrook Palace of Justice after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, possession of it in order to trade in it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These inspections were carried out following a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information that we received from the public, which allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers in the regional unit investigating the city of Estria State Police Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservative Bill, which the government believes should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be overpowered, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday have said that they cannot support it.
"I rely on the Charter to a significant extent."
"I stand straight on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said the Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after a weekly meeting of the week du causus.
Liberals insist that a bill, as proposed, that would allow for up to one year of detention of any person coming from a ship, identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The chief of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he cannot support the bill because it is heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough with regard to illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that we should take action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the carrier of another draft law, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative Bill because it places blame on refugees and places children in prison for at least one year," explained Mrs Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians are mass reporting to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that are targeting Canada and treating it like some kind of degenerate."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, and Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to vote to reject it.
At the same time, one Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote that every Member who opposes should be held accountable for his position before his constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public investigation committee on the issue.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, seeks to prevent this idea from falling into oblivion: Québec intends to consult the Department of Investigation from New York as early as January next year.
Metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised one of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
More was not needed for a public security critic, PQ Party Stéphane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as a "rabbit pulled out of a hat" and "amateur solution botched on a knee."
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They'll settle for confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace setting up witness interviews in a public trial.
"Moreover, Mr Charest maintains that he does not want to create this committee of inquiry, and people think, as you and I think, that he is hiding something," explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Politics at the Institute for the Education of High State Officials.
In order to come out of this impasse, Quebec suggested that he grant special authority to the Inspector General so that he could investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the Commissioner, who is allowed to force people to testify.
Creating a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government's writings.
Quebec would also, after Ottawa, change the Penal Code to be better adapted for this type of crime.
This request would be based on an agent for Operation Marteau (Hammer), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marco Fournier that the case-law of this type of investigation was not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this dossier.
During Operation Jaro 2001, which affected a group of bikers, even though the Penal Code has not yet been modified, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have been under strict control due to heavy rainfall that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated preemptively.
There was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's out of control.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit heavy rainfall, i.e. rain from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were hit the most.
It could drop up to 100 millimeters in total.
If we add these rainfall to the melting snow accumulated in some sectors, we can worry about flooding in some watercourses.
Quebec's rescue service announced Wednesday night a warning about the danger of flooding for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière caused severe rainfall of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
A makeshift bridge was torn down in Saint-Calixte as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais spilling some lakes from the shores caused some roads to close, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency services are on alert and overseeing the situation in this area, reported by Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued a warning on Wednesday about strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamped
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) because of controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians, as well as gross expression during broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM group had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative representation of Haitians of gross expression that did not correspond to the broadcast broadcast during the day."
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the transmission of the names of both persons who took their lives, did not violate the regulations for radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the joint front of recipients of social support to Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts put on the air were inaccurate.
The moderators must submit reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the Commission's members concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide cannot be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the" Dupont's Mid-Morning Reports "have come across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate way. '
There was no complaint against him.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went into a media shootout that triggered a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator said that he did not send a gift to help the Haitians, because we cannot know for sure that the needy will actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already made up for my three-day delay on this thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," said the host.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
In any event, CHOI-FM's radio broadcasts cooperated "beyond their responsibilities."
For a station which will, inter alia, have to notify these decisions once during the course of the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fuvà of Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemal, has an extremely strange time.
An athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung fu full contact), in kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the tatami and ringy of the world looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches kind of everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, just delivered bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, from October 23 to 30, Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won categories kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, said."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in San Shou."
"The competitors were invited to finish the first four at the last world championship in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished my eighth."
"In 2007 in China I ended up in a fifth-shot tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, added."
"Interestingly, I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline coming from China, where fists and feet, as well as throwing them to the ground, are allowed.
The matches take place traditionally on the platform and rarer in the ring.
The most famous boxer, arising from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda" Supertournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains the likeable fellow."
"It's kind of the equivalent of Stade Lumpinee."
"It was a great experience."
Zemal won his first match in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg) before he suffered a loss in the finals.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will meet so that a single champion, king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without tender
Hydro-Québec agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this avalanche of over 100 contracts, it is the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project of a total of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie Géance, was authorised in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec in order to confer its responsibility on the private sector for the management of this major hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie genius' consortium received a lucrative contract without any tender notice.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of businesses puts us in the face of a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and inducing price increases.
"It's a new way to carry out collusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that the people who are no longer doing side deals, they are now doing them openly," said PQ Member Sylvain Simard at the press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard to bear how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, argued in the afternoon, strongly denying that this contract was a collusion.
"I have my own path," she thundered and claimed that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacking accuracy."
She said that "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more companies to group their mutual expertise in order to respond to the call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of work.
The construction is already running and must be arranged by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to negotiate; it was trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formulation of consortia in the field of engineering advice is under investigation in the government.
If we cross over the business register of Quebec companies quickly, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau operates in partnership with most of its main competitors; let us name CIMA +, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, which is Dessau.
As regards Énergie Géance, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970's'.
The main sponsor of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the energy company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which would force us to scratch our forehead at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a tender and there are few participants in the bidding contest, your prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: that you pick up the people who are involved in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say," Let's make a satisfactory deal and have a good price. "
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of the people," confirmed Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie genius consortium is part of a long list of over $50,000 contracts received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SebJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification of Le Devoir, 109 contracts for engineering consultancy concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular laboratories carrying out soil sample analyses.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, out of which Genivar gained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a stake in the "Energy Géance."
All contracts were closed.
Together, they amount to $449 783 344, including a contract with Energie Géance at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good friends of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau deleted the report that the PQ was also linked to the firms that "finance it" before stating that it was rather its managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the players of sustainable development, as well as in "impartial" brands and environmental certificates, to be guided accordingly by the choice of products.
The worst part is that even when we bathe in the media universe, which urges us and encourages us to consume socially more responsibly, this media universe cries out about the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfil obligations that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, states the Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Even though consumption increased in 2010, so called socially responsible products, the people of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, still don't trust them very much.
Two-thirds of us are actually saying that they don't trust the promises of environmental companies, simply because green advertising companies find out the measuring tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates based on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are referred to as ecologically responsible, says Barometre.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this issue is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems to be the prime element in stimulating this consumption page, which is currently being revived by almost a third of the Quebec consumers.
Indeed, a vacuum and the dubious nature of information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre identified after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the population of Quebec is mistrust of the reported product data or the "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
61% of them preferred purchases from traders in their neighbourhood and preferred the purchase of food produced in their region, Baromètre states.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - Homo consumus Québeku likes to present himself as the king of recycling, which seeks the least impact on the environment by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience clearly remained somewhere outside their car, Baromètre states: in 2010, barely 28% of the population of Quebec reported that they were using mass transport or that they recommended the use of a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
The walk and round also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan to buy the cinema eXcentris complex
The Quebec Government, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle," which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy away the cinema complex on Saint-Laurenta and which demonstrated its mission as a film art lover, did not obtain what it requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, Quebec's government proposed a loan, the amount of which would, moreover, be lower, some of the original expectations that could build a basis for a viable solution under favourable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications were already revised for reductions.
The proposal and plan of action were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Enterprise in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODO on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the gift hypothesis from the state must really be rejected.
Let us remember that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, assuming that the Minister of Culture is not to finance a real estate project when it did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the debate, on the other hand, called for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his cinemas during ten years of film art after financing the construction of the complex himself, which may have been the reason for the changes made by the financial council of the state.
The lack of halls for independent films is loud in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to win a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, believing that they will receive $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and to project the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not mention Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group think about the proposals for shrinking that are being made to him.
A raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American sources, known through WikiLeaks, reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferior Canadian to Americans, but with the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian electorate is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to voting, and they believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, unveiled yesterday in public, provide sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The Communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great wonder of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations about this situation.
"The Canadian inferior complex, almost fixated, makes it possible for political leaders to talk about internal bets, instead of realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he writes.
"The United States is, therefore," concluded, "by the proverbial elephant in these elections: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to speak of."
The ambassador understands this' deafening silence 'all the less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better of the party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the election."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'Affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's preservation of confidence in early February, regarding the federal budget that Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes M. Brees.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of Parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to an increasingly negative picture that the United States is throwing at the dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the transmission of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which it is possible to observe not too subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to abductions for the purposes of violent interrogations with the CIA.
Another report reports that in their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some of the Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the case-by-case principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "passed some paper regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, State Secretary."
"The secretary accepted to revise the file."
Finally, let us note that the persons concerned by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on the waves of CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
It went public, and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World plan for lighting renewal
Yesterday, in Cancún, the UN proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, lighting of shops and industrial areas in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect reduction (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the next restriction to be achieved to stabilise the planet's climate from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implement commitments to reduce on the part of industrialised countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if we replace hot bulbs that monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market with fluo-compact or, even better, electric-luminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on a planet created for lighting would be cut off.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of the fleet emissions on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, were involved in voluntary reduction plans that should allow the global emissions of GES to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve a stabilization of climate heating to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020, so that it can be excluded that it will not get out of control.
In heated filament lamps 95% of energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluoro-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new bulbs with DEL, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluo-compact bulbs can withstand an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
New bulbs with DEL, one that was introduced this week into Philips' production - this company allegedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, which gives us an idea of possible savings with a substitution plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluoro-compact filament lamps because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless producers set up collection centres.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluoro-compact bulb, but rather a thermal coal-fired power plant that emits many mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
Only in the United States do these centers put 25 000 tons of mercury into circulation every year.
The report also gives in detail the profits each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat plants, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines set have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce its preliminary results without delay, underlining the UN President's spokesperson."
"He asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from taking any initiatives until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the Election Commission allowed the latest date - Wednesday midnight - to pass without publishing the results three days after Sunday's scrutinium.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI confirmed on TV that the Commission "continues to work" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls have increased throughout the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between the resigning Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "fraudulent" vote in the north, administered by former New Army rebels (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters practised by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country, drove the supporters of President Côte d'Ivoire away from voting.
The elections could be nullified if the Constitutional Council took account of the complaints lodged by Gbagbo.
But President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a North man who denies any connection with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go far enough to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered a loss and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the election committee from transmitting the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, which took place on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the reunification and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided in two halves for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations pointed out to the Côte d'Ivoire political faction that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, October 31, as a winner with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, in the sense of the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as indicated by provisional data with correction for seasonal variations (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The unemployment rate has stabilized to 2,631 million in the metropolis.
The data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9,3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9,7%, including the overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but wish to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of current young people on the labour market has escalated with a new increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, + 0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were, in the sense of the International Labour Office, unemployed.
As regards the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+ 0.2 points in three months as well as in a year), i.e. 482 000 people from 50 years up and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 benefited from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, + 0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following the controversy on its calculation method.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to produce monthly statistics and announced 9.8% for France (including DOM) on Tuesday, after 9.9% in October.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and put into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of waste management companies and the brother of the PS Board of Directors Bouches-du-Rhône, has been charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in a public procurement investigation, allegedly obtained.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of misuse of the company's assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealing, granting bribes, accepting bribes in order to influence the office and possession of ammunition, stated by his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is a warrior and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions he intends to ask him, not some delusion."
"It is easy to persecute him for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them," said his attorney, Florence Rault, for the AFP, before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini stated through his lawyers that he had sent a brief statement to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
With regard to the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of any such thing, said Simon.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Agglomigne Agglomeration Services, was charged on Wednesday for misuse of public funds and conspiracy, and left free, under judicial supervision with a ban to associate, protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to explain all the facts he was accused of."
"The investigating judge stands by and leaves him free," stated his attorney, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released on Tuesday to Wednesday night, with two of whom being under judicial supervision, stated Deputy District Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for taking bribes in order to influence the Office and for passive corruption. "
Two officials from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged with "alienation and abuse of the company's assets," the other for "conspiracy in misuse of public funds."
Finally, a business associate of Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "concealing abuse of the company's assets."
Among the persons who were confronted with Mr Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in a case involving fraudulent public contracts concerning Corsica, is present.
Investigators suspect his company was helping launder money from extensive gangsta.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search focuses mainly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the city community of Marseille (MPM).
The Clotilde Reiss case: Elysian Palace exaggerated the mediation of Syria
Within more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," united views in France, put diplomacy on alert and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France, and a wanted US justice for the fraudulent trafficking of material in favour of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they subject the sharp light to the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accentuate the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't really do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline: "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages'.
An advisor from the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richie, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of Allegron's American diplomacy.
They explain the French method to him.
They encourage Americans to do just as much to bring back their own nationals, held by force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "constantly speak strongly" in the media the words "the fundamental rights of man," "innocence," "immediate deliverance."
Iran's image-sensitive regime must be brought into trouble.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richie recalls that arresting foreigners is "Iran's family tactic: taking hostages for" political blackmail. "
He announces that Klotilda Reiss' liberation (which will take place on 16 August, on the day the French Embassy provides shelter) "will require the payment of a high financial sum to the Iranians' (bail of EUR 230 000).
And they announce that the Elysian Palace is anti-citing hostage cases, a phenomenon that will "escalate."
In the future, Iranians could "arrest around 1800 other French people living in Iran," he states.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released to freedom in Paris at the discretion of a judge.
Like many observers, the US Embassy is asking questions about this disturbing consensus.
The expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, who is chasing illegal Iranian networks to acquire material for the nuclear program.
France agreed to negotiate?
The liberation of an Iranian for the liberation of a young French woman?
On the next interview with Kathleen Allegron, September 4th, François Richie assures that this is not the case.
The Elysian Palace, as it states, was not only "surprised by this decision by the judge," but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There have been talks between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the court's decision," notes.
Mr Richie also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "restricted" supervision of the French intelligence service.
Elysian Palace Advisor dials the phone number, hangs up the phone and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings administered by the Iranian Embassy. "
At the time of Klotilda Reiss' imprisonment in Iran, the Elysian Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqué and organised "leaks" to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing a "significant" and "influential" role of "mediator."
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and note that manipulation bears its fruit, because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes media "flex" of French officials'.
What is based on such a measure of "gratitude," expressed in relation to M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their declarations of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "is aimed at validating President Sarkozy's opening policy with Syria," he analyses.
The policy applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad, marked as premature and undeserved."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks "to demonstrate to Syria what eulogy it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow grain of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. embassy knows that from a very good source.
On August 11th, François Richie confided in him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But yet we thanked them."
"This should at least bring confusion and confusion between the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it at the Elysian Palace.
In the communiqué he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrywoman."
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecivalsky," which will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, the government's responsible officials have said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have learning problems at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," declared for AFP Jo Rin, the head of the ministry in charge of the bill.
Online games will be newly accessible from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, specified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the time of day-to-day access to these games for young people whose parents so request has been supplemented by a responsible worker.
It will also make free programs available to people who ask for it, allowing us to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected," and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: Fifa sets up host countries.
Full of unrest due to suspicion of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee sets up on Thursday the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a choice supremely politically motivated, where the struggle for influence and lobbying risks overcoming the technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Fife Royal Competition in 2012 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to plant in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons to participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, senior government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives you the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting throughout the world.
Backstage negotiations face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy by candidate.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the documentation in English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation in their competitors.
But these reasons will not have much weight on 22 members of the executive committee at the voting hour.
At the beginning of the discovery, the Sunday Times, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE / European Commission? / For corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have destroyed the chances of its country, the cradle of soccer, which so far hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
On Monday, the BBC crowned it when it broadcast a document that "bugged" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fife unhappy and put English leaders in trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that his predecessor, Tony Blair, made in 2005, managed to acquire the Olympic Games' organization for London in 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at CE (European Commission)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portugal do not lack the trumpets of the already prepared stadiums, its serenity (the 1982 World Championship in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, the Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But both countries' grim economic and financial perspectives could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin has decided not to move to Zurich and publicly declare "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in verbal innuendo barely distorted against the English press against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, try to compromise them," said Mr Poutin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favorite with its considerable experience in 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, Fife's main sponsors' headquarters, seems to have a big lead ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have built a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries that passed the "exam" together in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the World Cup 2026 to China, which Fifa desperately wants, has made Asia's chances invalid for 2022.
With Qatar, who pulled a big ace out of his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the weak TV charges (due to a time shift) paid by European countries, which form the driving force for Fife.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand made it seem like he was hesitating.
The Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace calls on someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secrets associated with the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persist.
In one way or another.
In 2006, without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that the third mandate should not be excluded.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured him that he would "make a decision sometime in the autumn of 2011."
As the members of the UMP Parliament recall on Wednesday night at the Elysian Palace, the perspective of the 'two mandates' has sown a little feverish.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was only a statement on his part, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he's reminded of presidential elections in such meetings in a humorous tone.
"Worst case, or best case, you still have seven and a half years to go with me," he switched in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His previous statements yesterday will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make him a candidate or less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to the Ségolène Royal Colbion, pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, it is because its 2012 candidacy is evident that many in PS want to arrange for combat assemblies rather premature than intended.
Bad recon on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy before Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this UMP issue," people from the immediate and prudent vicinity of the Prime Minister responded.
"If he believes possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Bank of the year was to be an opportunity to specify the conditions for the exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which must be completed by the end of that year.
The sovereign European debt crisis is bound, and the Securities Issue Institute will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration of the situation already so tense in the European securities markets.
In such a case, the political price would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in dealing with the debt crisis of European states.
She did not want to say whether she thought the bank could do more, for example, by increasing their programme of buying sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)."
In the evening before that, in Brussels, in his interview with the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, he did not appear to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and he was satisfied that he stated that the programme for the purchase of state titles on the secondary market was "continuing 'and that" we will see how we will decide' during the meeting held this Thursday.
One certainty: the Central European Bank will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases made by the Central European Bank of Treasury bonds have doubled to almost EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And due to the lack of understanding of the market negotiators, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the central banks of the euro system have bought at EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt in the market for anti-cipation on the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change of course.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, the latter shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her schedule in any significant way."
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of creating short-term new tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commercial Bank.
"The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely ', preceded by Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its intervention in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of the purchase of its bonds in order to revive the weak market," adds Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace, at all costs, the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the burst of paid performance by states belonging to the most fragile," yesterday, a major bond manager testified.
Because if interest rates take off, countries will suffer even more to reduce their debt rather than stabilise it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government has a back.
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the worrying situation relaxed a little, yesterday with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary rest.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the Economy, the presidents of the regions said that they heard Giulio Tremonti classify the situation as "unresolved" and that he expected a "unpredictable" weekend, which he then demoted.
In any event, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) flew up to 263 points, causing some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with the "turbulent development of markets" and the possible disease of Irish origin.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and insignificant fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and puts the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels's latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
From now on, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates the government deficit will still represent 4.3% of gross domestic product in the next year (against 3.9% foreseen by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence, a reputation for a new summary of the supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is accepting support from international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are correct and its calculations are correct, we repeat this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119,2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is smaller than that required by other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the main economist of the OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure for the Chamber of Deputies, and after that, the elections envisaged at the end of March could begin to be organised.
This would start a period, not suitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde pointed it out again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans demonstrated it on Sunday throughout the day and night, are clearly very much in solidarity with the commitment to defend their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, concerning interest on European state bonds, brought water to the mill to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
Standard & Poor's notation office has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, the targets that are most targeted by various speculation.
"Because in May, a real lack of transparency and obvious policy, mainly based on banking systems," says the economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so, "political time runs slower than market time."
Knowing this intermittent context and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most concerned problem, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
In view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings since the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is taking place today.
The fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets is on the agenda (see above).
As regards the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore, in order to inform Far East investors about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of this journey is not to increase funds, it will certainly prepare the ground to achieve this objective.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, the US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
First and foremost countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid have a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before applying their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms needed to regain their lasting confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bonds markets.
On his way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether the EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would be enough, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, who is the actor of the very first plan for trade in European sovereign claims, believe that an addition of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, "rather" in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
There is a means: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which has been subsidised to date by EUR 60 billion.
A Council that has every chance of being tried in Europe's capitals.
Especially when market conditions were deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have orange alert.
Snow rations are still causing difficulties in transport, especially on the second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting certain economic activities.
Twenty-four counties now have an orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined 20 districts already declared orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later that night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfalls are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and the forest Charentes, and it is weakly snowing on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the concerned districts and from 1 to 3 cm, from 5 in the Paris region.
The counties of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côte d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the counties of Basse-Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin are concerned.
Snow flows are large enough to cause transport difficulties and disturb some economic activities, predicting Météo France.
On the coast of Côte d'Armor, some counties banned heavy freight traffic - freight cars over 7,5 tonnes with Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to the police, and the police recommend that you drive your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Picardia, school connections were banned on Thursday.
No special measures are foreseen on Wednesday night to limit freight transport.
The District Office "calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt road driving to the nature of the road '.
On Thursday, the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy airport in Paris and 10% in Orly due to the expected snowfall.
DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services to contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick airport in south London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
It has been raining billions since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this building to be launched, the State has announced the granting of a subsidy of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is an amount which will then enable SGP to use part of its double funding for its contracts.
Today we are finally coming to the first amendment.
The 2010 Financial Rectification Act, which is being examined by the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing the tax on offices on Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
It is quantified: "The revenue from this interest is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for offices which already exist in order to "be modernised, to increase the yield obtained from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would it cost?
A mirage.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're a long way from $4 billion.
"It is stated that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion from the capital subsidy, which will be mobilised by the State and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
We at SGP do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then dig up to four billion, it explains."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
SGP considers that 4 billion will only be credited in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the four promised billions still belong to the abonents, risks creating a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Vindictive hackers and prowess spies
The WikiLeaks case has double meaning.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, anticipating a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in an orderly fashion.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm that every document compiled by the Secret Service (any nation) consists exclusively of print cuts.
The "extraordinary unveiling" of Americans about the way Berlusconi's sexual life has been reported by everyone for months to read in any newspaper (all except these two Berlusconi own), and the infamous cartoon profile of Kadafi has long been a sketch theme for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents can only consist of reports already known is crucial in the dynamics of secret services, not just in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to seek new information (he does not know where to find reports of non-existent ones), but because those who are devoted to the occult believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret service (and if not, he could be, as I know, the editor in the newspaper of Liberia) who considers only what he admits to be true.
Information with high secrecy about Berlusconi that the US Embassy sent to the State Department was the same information Newsweek published a week before.
Then why is there so much fuss about the discovery of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can make phone calls or fly on a plane to a joint dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into a spy center.
Any spectator watching movies about an investigation knows very well that it seems to be seemingly ignored out of self-interest.
However, the fact that this is repeated in public defies the duty of hypocrisy and throws a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information from the most powerful country in the world is a hard strike, not a considerable one, for the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "executor."
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, it was possible to embrace all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since the possibility of controlling every move through a phone, every transaction made, a visited hotel, a used highway, and so on, the citizen became the ultimate victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate, as we do now, that even the "tombs" with the most secret information powerful can't resist the intervention of some hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets be maintained?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is a meaningless secret (and the uncontained secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is truly a secret without substance because it is pulled out of public life; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was an uncontained secret, it means removing all power from him.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this blow given to the power be so significant?
Clearly, in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equivalent to its publication on a poster glued on the corner of the street.
But it is also absolutely obvious that with current technology it is useless to hope that you can keep secret messages on the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and made contact with one of its colleagues.
How will private and sensitive reports be kept secret in the future?
I know for the moment that my prognosis belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials carrying discreetly performing formalities along uncontrollable routes and carrying only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide rare information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in drawers sealed by the key: total, the attempt at espionage in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving sideways now, that is backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph was a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on wires (telephone).
Video cassettes (analogs) allowed cinema lovers to scan film step by step, move it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of assembly, while now CD (digital) only allows you to jump on chapters, i.e. after macroportions.
We will be arriving from Rome to Milan in three hours, while travelling by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
So it is not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques return to horses-drawn vehicles.
One last comment.
Other times, the press tried to understand what had been planned in the secret of the embassy.
Now it's the embassies asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to keep the promises of rapidly unblocked financing (fast start or early start) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were exposed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries have committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (that is, EUR 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU pulled a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report specifying the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued at its true value: an advanced country and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same, with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, leading it to the right path to keep its promise of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional 'to ensure that the increased burden is realised without damaging Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for three years of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or with terms at the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France considers that the funding of "all new projects' in 2010 is" new and additional '.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for Development d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, France's total aid to developing countries may remain constant (or even decrease), with a view to complying with its commitment to funding "new and additional '...
Another decisive element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider that €1 borrowed equals €1 donated.
Clearly, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be evidenced for some investments that are profitable (often projects linked to reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as equivalent to one euro that we give..., we should not see it as a result of our commitments, but as a loan price for the creditor country (i.e. interest rate equivalent).
But France can only give the following reasons: "it respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million, making it a 91,5% loan (EUR 389,8 million) and 8,5% donation (EUR 36,1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that makes use of a loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) comply with their obligations with 100% of the donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 to the satisfaction of its promise, France gives only 10 centimeters and considers this effort comparable.
What a nice trick!
To summarise, in its "fast start" financing, France operates with double-deceivance: on the one hand, with the development of the stock in time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it only spends EUR 36.1 million, it can convince that it is spending EUR 420 million "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
Manipulating the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when it is enough to lend?) and to negotiate because developing countries are not entirely naive...
The early financing chapter is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw on the findings from this first year of early financing.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and decency and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France should prevent discussions about deposits in long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the issue of 'additional' or the way in which loans are accounted for.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive on these deposits as it is on others.
So everyone puts hope in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will be coming to Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additional" and use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
A pesticide alarm that kids eat.
A ten-year-old will one day consume 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Movement for Rights and the Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "do not have significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed issue ', bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child approximately ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as confectionery, have been analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are among the carcinogenic, possible or likely substances, and five substances are clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive for internal-emolation glands (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical received individually are not exceeded, in our research we can well see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and / or PE is striking," states the associations.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk in themselves contain about ten résidues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residues that could interfere with the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, referred to by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak of minced meat, the tuna in the can and even the bagel and gum were spiked with pesticides and other chemicals.
Nitrates and chloroform have been detected in the water from the faucet of the analysis.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat up the food in the microwave oven was avoided by analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this "contaminants cocktail" is likely to be underestimated, "resulting from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) proposed "to set up a moratorium on pesticide use to stop the" increase in civilisation diseases "in the face of an emergency situation.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the state of the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
