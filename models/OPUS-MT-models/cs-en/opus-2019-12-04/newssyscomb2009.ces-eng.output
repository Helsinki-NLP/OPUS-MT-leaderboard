Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
The significant weakening of both sides of the current great coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties led to early elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZEK), the Korutan governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy remains with 29.8% of the vote, but it loses 5.5% of the vote against the last elections of 2006.
The ÖVP was even worse off, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of both these large parties in Austria's post-war history, and especially among the people who triggered the early elections, literally a disastrous outcome.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP stepped out of the coalition, the people had a considerable lead in preference to the SPA.
But the voters clearly punished them for letting the government crash.
Even in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party president and the current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers consider that this could happen on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's Bureau.
Such a development would likely facilitate the path to the ever-more likely exit from the electoral outcome, namely the restoration of the Great Coalition of SPÁ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FPZs), they had a preliminary 18% and 11% of the votes - but at the same time, the Social Democrats expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the populist people agreed (at the time the FPZs were still united, in 2005 they split from BZZK) to a common government that even triggered sanctions by the European Union.
Obviously, Haider is betting on this development, which has already said that he is ready to work with either side and presupposes a return to Vienna to national politics.
The Green Party has also entered Parliament, but it has easily lost its way and has fallen between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and did not make it to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal beetle collection in India could not be resolved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, some cooling of Czech-Indian relations would occur.
The minister mentioned it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranáb Mukherji.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, then some cooling would have occurred," he stated after the meeting that took place on the Czech initiative.
After the negotiations, Mukherji said that executive power could be difficult to interfere with.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Schvách, who has been acquitted and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local government in Darjiling, whose jurisdiction the case falls under.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukherjee to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the verdict at liberty, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed his voice at the hearing as well.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech Party can enter into the matter is to give the condemned "competent legal support," said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that this kind of help was already being provided by the Indian Party.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognise this, "said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as the ČTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister avoided answering the question of whether he had been given an undertaking by the Indian side to deal with things.
"I've been given quite enough promises," he only stated.
Bohemia judges the battle for the seabed
They will access the wall electronic map showing Australia and the surrounding sea areas.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, along with the surrounding seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself, "says Luigi Santosuosso, the Italian lawyer, who belongs to the 30-member team of the United Nations Ocean and Law Division.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, watches and occasionally completes the interpretation.
There's work drive and enthusiasm.
The seabed has yet to be known, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, ore and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Grid greater than land
Today, coastal states have started applying for new marine territories vehemently.
According to the UN Convention, they are exercising their rights as agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres off the coast of the country.
It is exclusively entitled to all resources of the continental shelf under the Convention.
"Simply put, behind the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It goes beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, "explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf shall be supported by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the latter countries have succeeded so far, "says Mikulka.
The world's resonance has recently seen the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its underwater hold.
But New Zealand, too - the size of the seabed that the Commission admitted to it last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit they will make in the future from using the seabed will be invaluable, as they promise.
Other States shall submit their requests in turn.
They can do so up to ten years after ratifying the 'Montego Bay Convention'.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor region begins with a convention declared "the common heritage of humanity."
No State has an exclusive position here.
The law of mining in this area is granted by the Convention established by an international institution.
"The seabed is no Klondajk," says Director Mikulka at the top, saying that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organisation "Interoceanmetal."
In 1991, as well as the investors of a few other states, it acquired the status of the so-called "pioneering investor."
It has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor's examined area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is chipped, it's a sort of underwater replica of the Tater.
"It is possible to mine a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic optics containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division is bringing one such concretion to show.
Reminds me of a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a mythical shem, which, according to legend, revived the Golem.
The German Special Forces were in the process of liberating hostages.
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but there was no deployment.
Further details of the circumstances of the liberation of eleven in Egypt of kidnapped European tourists are gradually coming to the public.
German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and Interior.
According to the ministries, both Federal Army experts and members of the German GSG9 Counter-Terrorist Group, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene of the liberation.
But, according to a further communication from the two ministries from Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said one of the speakers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian guides in the south of Egypt on September 19.
After kidnapping in a desert region in the south of Egypt, they moved hostages in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the exemption or possible ransom payment.
They're safe now in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the liberation of the hostages is under the care of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of the release.
There is no information yet available in Berlin when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the bill of lading, all five tourists should fly with special forces one of the German Air Force Airbuses and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has, by a narrow majority, let a $700 billion bailout package fall.
The Dow Jones index went down pretty hard.
In a 206 to 227 vote, the US House of Representatives rejected a government bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides, the majority has not been found for a programme that should ease the chaos in the financial markets.
By dramatic action, the supporters were desperate to convince criticism of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the Member voted to give his consent, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to obtain political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he acknowledged.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
This was due to investors' concern that the State Rescue Package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index value was raised so that, after the announcement of the collapse of the package, it would fall sharply again.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must be approved.
Travel agents record increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, in the next month's travel bookings, turnover increased significantly - even more than 30% for the winter season compared to the previous year.
Despite weak economic growth, the German desire to travel remains unpolluted.
For winter reservations, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of last year, as stated by the German Travel Union (Deutsche Reiserband, DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK market research institute, increased number of reservations are already available for autumn months.
The turnover was thus about 11% higher in comparison to 2007, according to the DDRV for October.
The basis for these results is GfK numbers, which every month evaluates the reservation data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolates them on the overall market.
Reservations of tours that took place until the end of August 2008 were included in this result.
Because of the dollar's weak rate, travel to the US is mainly requested, the DRV said.
At these routes, the increase in reservations is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable targets for Germans.
First of all, organized tours are on course, declared by DRV Chairman Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising energy and food expenditure, "the cost to the client is easier to calculate than for individually organised holidays."
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who had made a journey decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Infinitely repeated spades, beer from the tubers and promoters in costumes from famous designers.
First time on a beer field.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV host, and she wears custom-made costumes.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from second hand.
But there is one thing that connects us: we are not yet three minutes in the beer meadow, and photographers are already throwing themselves at us, and the memory cards are filling agile - I am flattered, for I am on Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap costume has served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist, and I live north of the sausage equator, and so my feeling of comfort in my costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing women's clothes or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The only thing that gets weird looks at a banana stand in chocolate is my apron.
One Munich girl reminds me of the fact that I've mistied her: "On the left, you're free, in the middle of a virgin, on the right, widowed in the back."
I'll secretly switch the bow from the back to the left.
"All right," he says, and laughs.
Others don't care so much about subtle flirtation techniques and they wear simple felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stick out on the passing naked asses.
A young man with such exhibitive tendencies is named Bob, he's from England, and he's come to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He feels "gorgeful," with an extended "ooh."
That's what he tells me after he's relieved himself of his just-drank potions.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the fearsome "Wildbieslers," as they say in Bavaria in public for free urinating people.
Others don't have the happiness to get rid of alcohol that way.
Around 8: 00 p.m., the Oktoberfest is running around a lot of medics who have to take care of poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they carry covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors of beer meadows: empty there, full back again.
You can't see who lies under the tarp of this box of promises.
"It's you who can't go on," one of the paramedics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
Police released the name of the victim of the accident
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital was published after she was hit by a car in Essex.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson from Chelsea Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died later.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was already released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began to try to join the European Union, European powers sought to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the east bank of Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in a non-Renaissance style.
Well, that's what the tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits along the track at the end of the platforms with a tower on every corner of the facade, looking to indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you get inside the arched treasury, you can no longer have any doubts about the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gate the station was.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatoly-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, which was too late in the game of empires, intended to implement its ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond, the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by frozen Cold War borders, is gone.
British and colonial forces have advanced from Egypt and driven the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there's also bad news for Hydarpasha Station.
In 1917, the explosion of the munitions train destroyed her elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it's been crumbling, and history's been circling it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the widening horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - has created an entirely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by frozen Cold War borders, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet one of the leading experts of the AKP on foreign policy, the Turkish MEP, Suat Kinicklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride along the tracks, which reminded me of the old-world rhythms of the famous Night Post document, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, with its well-known Islamist roots, the AKP represents a shift in the paradigms of the Turkish consensus.
She aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main tent of AKP, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built in a growing suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and power handlers, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to do early morning business.
Suat Kiniclioglu could easily be a central-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The objective of the Party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly, "he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today, they have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But surely there will come a time," I asked, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "he did not wish such a decision to be made."
He then stressed what almost everyone I have spoken to has said almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are equally beneficial to Europe and to the United States as well as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, Europe as a whole seems to be able, metaphorically speaking, to travel east on these tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after the next mostly night, I thought of the two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find out that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East can now, for the most part, be in Turkish hands.
And when I waited for the ferry back through Bosphorus in the harbor, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe."
So it seems that at least at that time there was not much doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, 9 / 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded a great young Proteus choir for a year.
It was supposed to be 21 years old, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, there were a few of us almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape-shifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to embark on any music presented to him - whether by madrigals or Messiaen, whether alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of the only man and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant all the time.
How often only Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it! "
His baton technique was very clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorship nor flowery.
Wherever the music standard was, he always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he conducted the Guildford Filharomino from 1962 to 1982.
Over the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "pulled one or two seeped stones around the world."
He'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff's note from the author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
Indeed he spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houbloon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff crossed that part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny" Flamenco and Life, "because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was caught up in the simplicity and strength of the bullets they use on the audience, and in the consideration and respect of the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments. "
Honda strikes for the second time with her bestseller
In November, Honda will start selling second generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle has already had considerable space, it now offers even more spacious interior.
Improved engines are connected to this, which increase driving comfort and allow more fuel saving.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes in this single-space vehicle.
For example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less well-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case for Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Honda Jazz was put on the market.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million pieces sold in six years.
However, Honda aims to make the new Jazz increase its sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 pieces of Honda Jazz, in 2009 estimates of 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, which means 6.7% of the total sale of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects the sale of 2 000 pieces per year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the car company is thus de facto expecting the end of the year with a total of 22 000 pieces sold, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a 16% decrease.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its Spanish market share to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid of a compact size with a length of 4.37 metres, from which Japan's company promises to sell around 200,000 pieces a year worldwide.
As far as markets are concerned, the Japanese producer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be shared between the old continent and Japan.
The opening of the sale of Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length increased up to 3.9 metres (five centimeters more), a width of 1.69 metres (two centimeters more) and a wheelbase of 2,5 metres, which means an elongation of 5 centimetres.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
The size increase also increased the internal space.
This advantage was obtained by using the new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the luggage compartment for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the engine version 1.4, as the luggage compartment volume of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Further improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment glazed with panoramic roof - makes it easier to access the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an angle of opening 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Honda Jazz has new engines.
At the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time as high torque in the full engine speed range.
The first 1.2 litre engine has a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of the Jazz car - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and an emission of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, it will now be 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with a power output of 100 horsepower has combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"The bee car" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan inspired himself in nature, specifically in bees, to progress on the technologies protecting against accidents.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes bees as a role model to prevent collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Technical Progress Centre Nissan Motor Co. Robotka developed a prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo in cooperation with the Center for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research.
According to Kazuhir Doie, CEO of public relations for technology, brand research and development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four security shield zones of Nissan.
The robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent rainfall on this brand's vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the security shield of Nissan.
The most important, however, are folded bee eyes which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles up to a distance of two metres within a radius of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics bee movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to a right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this had not been the case, the robot would not have been able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles, "explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobile Laboratory and Chief Engineer of this project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards or downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and direction which is allowed by the rotation of its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities like bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan used the rotation function to prevent the robot from crashing.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and to be maintained according to these data.
It does not require retention of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which allows it to function without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigs or mega in memory. "
This is the first step in developing new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, a technology where Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the target and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy your fear before you take your mortgage
It has to be acknowledged that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to hand out injections, is neither lack of ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages from banks with dubious solvency, it created a popular-learning game on the Internet called "Bad Credit Hotel."
Or "Bad Loan Hotel..." or a mixed-up hotel.
The hotel, especially its receptionist, looks gloomy to make one, two or three changes to whether or not it's the right time to ask for credit.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site more suitable for young people than for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
A dream room will appear inside the hotel.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens up his capital MUFG
Morgan Stanley's bank house announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank to spend nine billion dollars, entered its center to obtain 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report accompanied a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's current shares at a uniform price of $25.25, which represents a total sum of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
The MUFG Bank invests another $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the entire operation will take place on the basis of an average uniform price of $29, i.e. 28% below his current rate.
Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley's shares were down 6.79% and reached $23.07 at around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the road to speeding up Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is supposed to allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time it places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest aces to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan merely announced that he will sell up to 20% of his shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"Just a week ago we thought," explained Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG, in Tokyo, that our participation would consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley's securities 7% less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a 20% cut in share profits.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter exchange at a price of 50% above the exchange price, i.e. about $47 for a certain period of time.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash flow.
However, the group spokesperson refused to provide any more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15% of Tier One's solvency ratio, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan made it clear that since the end of August, it has "downgraded" its balance sheet significantly.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group, because its exchange rate has fallen by half, while insurance costs against the risk of default associated with debt have increased sharply.
These costs developed in reverse on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" from the big Wall Street investment banks, announced after the crash of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's buy-out, withdrew $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quit on Monday.
To re-establish a republic around the socialism of the 20th century.
This is the joint project of Venezuela Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to the vote, following the model of his counterparts and friends, a proposal for a new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, the "No 'received 28%, 7% of the votes were void and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order to accept the draft Constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the East of the Election Room and the calculation of the NGO predicted a clear victory on Sunday 'yes', with a range of 63% to 70%.
After all, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night to Monday.
"The Constitution prevailed on the whole line," assured and congratulated Ecuador in Guayaquil's governor's mansion, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Organisation of States of America's observation mission (OEA), took place peacefully, concerned the text on 444 points building a "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The draft Constitution endorses the power of the State over the economy by reserving it "development planning" of a country primarily based on the extraction of diesel by foreign companies and foreign exchange, which are sent by its emigrants.
The proposal initiated by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the authority of the head of state, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power to apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution reinforces the principle of free health and education, which the President began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, he is also counting on banning the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuador base as a starting point for US drug operations.
19 hostages were liberated in Chad
The Egyptian task force attacked the hijackers of 11 tourists and their eight-man escort who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
They were liberated in Chad during the morning by an Egyptian commando.
The hostages arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft to an al-Maza military base just adjacent to Cairo's international airport.
They were immediately transferred without being able to speak in the press, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, a peripheral residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are fully healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers," said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garrana at the airfield.
Since its capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel drive vehicle at the foot of Uanat Mountain, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hideout to the other by unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border officer of the Aegyptous agency, safari organizers.
A leader of the Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 members of the Special Forces who approached the site on board two helicopters had set off on the trail during the night just before dawn.
"There was a firefight, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of Egypt's special forces from the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and forces of Italian special forces from Belgrade, where he is currently located.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of the people of our secret services, of the special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied payment of the ransom.
On the eve of the day before, the Sudanese army declared that it had seized a four-wheel-drive vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six of them, including the Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Silent majority of the cultural department
The debate on the funding of culture fills the newspaper's pages with headlines and is the subject of an ongoing election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to plunder the poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national sites that starve to death?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that he ignores his monuments and his historic buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is donating three and a half million euros to the restoration of a mere Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours say in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organisations, in synergy.
In Québek, in the Federation of companies for the history of Québek, there are at least 40 000 volunteers associated with 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy on the expansion of history, the preservation of a pile of private archives and the preservation of archeological remains for a few small ones.
Often, these societies are the watchdogs of our monuments, which are driven by hopelessly protesting when promoters and executives emit their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we going to see the Tribune for history and monuments?
Benelux governments from the state of Fortis Bank
Benelux states will help Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch bank, which was the first to get into trouble in Europe because of the spread of the US mortgage market crisis, by partially nationalising: three countries will support a money and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed on this with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to have been in a major crisis in international financial markets that has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made on this issue could be seen as precedents from a point of view.
In the sense of the decision that was born on Sunday night, all three states will redeem almost half (49%) of the bank's assets there.
The bank will sell with absolute certainty part of its holdings of capital, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis's shares began to decline sharply last week, with serious signs of crisis already appearing in the Institute in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to fail.
The company's securities fell only by 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year minimum.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's total market capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's leaders, this is unrealistic.
Indeed, the company's management blames the collapse of Fortis' shares for the uncertainty in the overseas market associated with the adoption of a $700 billion US package plan.
On Monday, the stock went up slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO of Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
The Money Institute has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has ever come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian Government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients, and branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis banka has a separate branch and also purchased several leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with a candidate based on people's data on the purchase of medicines.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the hen house to a fox, "quotes the Washington Post of Richard Dick, the author of a prescription program.
Insurance companies shall make premiums and amounts paid in the event of claims dependent on the health status of the candidates and, if the risk is assessed as too large, they shall not close the insurance with them.
They used to send those concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer from pharmacies will easily find out what medicines the person bought in the last year and a half, which will show the program itself how he suffers from the disease and what his health is like.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to his virtually uncontrollably high levels of blood fats, which immediately puts him in the higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of them also determine the risk coefficient, so there is almost no work left for the insurance company in addition to paperwork, although there are minor problems.
The disadvantages are that many medicines can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are used against migraine or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
These represent an important risk-enhancing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, whereas the former difficulties do not.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been set up to request the patient's permission before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their negligence so far.
Some companies have been processing the results of laboratory tests recently, which link the data on the medicines they take to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, while controlling their use will become more and more difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which gives the authorities the power to control even enterprises specialising in the provision of data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick recognises that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his programme in such a way that the transmission of data is linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the permission in question can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with it.
So the chickens, after all, are somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this theme, alongside other, mostly global problems, has also been dominated by the agenda of the ninth summit at the highest level.
Today, the Franco-Indian summit will also be held, which will primarily involve cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
Indeed, the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak into international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not even discussed at yesterday's ninth summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, or President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or to increase to more than EUR 100 billion.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has increased from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an overambitious objective.
Twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements already in existence have been aligned from a legal point of view with India, so air transport has also received the green light in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be speeded up.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi ranks among the EU's partners up to ninth.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, has been condemned by both sides in all its forms and has called for a rapid call for a UN conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha Round of Business Negotiations, although they both have a large share of its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
This was also agreed by India, as well as by the fact that the next year's climate conference would need a global agreement and the production of greenhouse gas by 2050 to be reduced by 50%.
Both sides would also like to prevent rising food prices and support the call for an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister is coming to the French capital, where he is going to conclude a trade in the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will be given the mandate to build India's 20 billion euro nuclear reactors.
According to the Agency's reports, the Agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries to take up 171,790 square meters of trade fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inaugural festival in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) - at 264 square metres of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press at Room Structures Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, tendencies and perspectives as regards the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books is still diminishing in relation to the total Italian production, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found a plane called Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying across the desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on a single plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sieřra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aeroplane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, scattered the doubts that were still left: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we're sure it's exactly where Steve Fossett flew the day he disappeared" he said at a press conference.
So the sheriff stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The US Department of Transport Security (Ntsb) announced that several hours after detection of the wreckage, an investigative team was sent to identify the aircraft: it is exactly Bellanca 8kcab, which has been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found in one pair near their homes in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, cash money and one jacket.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of primacy.
In 2002, at his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world on a plane without landing.
His many records also include a flight of 15.445 meters above the Andes, though with a copilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and well defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the latest born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star house, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a vortex of news to this sector.
Thanks to its untraditional processing, communication will be unexpected and unconventional, which will accompany the launch of Suv Glk and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communication through the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main business class of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of a car in stereoscopic vision and with special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, if you look at the picture, you'll get the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be enlightened at various moments in all its little things, so that it will then once again complex in a single image.
The Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of car communication with this commercial.
Will he be able to raise the interest of future customers in this way?
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia," which has been watching Nazionale azurra for years, and which, to be honest, has never caused excessive problems.
She never even met her opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The Founders are from Triveneta.
Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colour flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: they were removed on Saturday night so that they would not be recognized.
They inspire themselves with English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found true Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all in name, i.e. easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with a running Dash, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadium.
The four blue fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and no match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the news that will come from the Bulgarian police, then take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo five years at least to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will never set foot in one stadium again.
To happiness.
But now there is fear of emulation: that means that more than 150 others will join.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not justify those who behave this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "pretty open eyes, especially for the national match on Wednesday in Leč."
There's a little support center in Puglia right now.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio, Tuesday, Casms, who can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that cares about the stadium problems.
"Führer-Fuhrer and strained arms during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who is the director of the Viminálské Osservatorium for a few weeks (he gained a position that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Quaestor in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia's supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that it is not a crime in Bulgaria to celebrate leaders, but, of course, the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Osservator's number one - crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far, this group has remained within limits, and now we're going to take a good look at what happened, and we're going to evaluate it for the future.
However, let us also talk about whistling at Mameli's anthem: it is not even a crime, but if you will allow it, it is a rudeness... "
