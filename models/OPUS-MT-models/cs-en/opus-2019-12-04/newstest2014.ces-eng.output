A black box in your car?
While American road designers are working hard to find money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see solutions in a small black box that can easily fit into the dashboard of your car.
The devices that track every kilometre that a motorist travels and transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of Washington's controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate America's major road financing system.
Usually the drab design of motorways suddenly fueled intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with environmentalists' groups and lobbied for the government to use these small lockers to record mileage and maybe even where you're going - and then this information would be used to compile a tax notice.
Tea party is appalled.
The US Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the kilometre of the road he's on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter where we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrat, Executive Director of the Southern California Civil Service Association, who plans to start monitoring the mileage of every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used to do this.
The incentive is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes that Americans pay at the gas stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars drive a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise their tax even by a single cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in transport policy from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
"In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user charge based on the number of kilometres travelled.
It is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change the patterns of driver behaviour, for example, which can help reduce traffic jams and create greenhouse gases.
California's designers look to this system in planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in ambitious laws on global warming.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transport Committee, said he also saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for mileage travel.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Strategy in the Reason organization.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers who encouraged Congress in 2011 to move in the payment direction per kilometre.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which was supposed to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives' leadership rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the population, whose daily life often means to travel many kilometres to work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most zealous is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the State a tax on mileage travel, instead of a tax on gasoline.
The pilot project has already been completed by Nevada.
New York is currently researching the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministries, together with coastal states in the East (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother monitoring and similar issues were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs strategy management and traffic at the Nevada Department of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into a full-fledged tracking device."
There is no need to build an enormous cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably extend to the record of daily trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of those few states that is trying to find available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many kilometers a car will drive, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
The hunt for such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was originally not involved in the action to assist the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break into an emerging legal liability insurance market where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would get away.
But this device, which is being tested, attracts the attention of road network designers because they don't use GPS and they only provide a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to do it if you don't follow their speed and location," says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do that.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of kilometres travelled by all citizens of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped in such a way that it is also possible to pay parking time charges, to provide travel-km insurance and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid traffic congestion.
"Motorists will be willing to participate in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," says the city's projection paper.
However, some transport planners would like to know whether all the discussions on payment per kilometre are not just a huge representative problem.
The officials of the Metropolitan Transport Committee in San Francisco say that Congress could very easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Strong Trust Fund by increasing the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you need to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka negotiates for the CSSD.
Social democracies are crumbling, folk and granny-women are talking to each other and are preparing for a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly aligned partners who will put on the table a complete list of demands, including ministerial posts.
Then the CSDP emissaries will either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days of carrying on a wave of sympathy, struck for the first time.
Yesterday, he failed to master the political grémie and, most importantly, to force convicted liars to resign.
Only he is a confirmed negotiator for the party, and the other members of the team will be allowed only after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (SAC).
I have apologized to the members of the Gremia and now to the citizens.
You're not supposed to lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hasek, after the negotiations of the narrowest leadership of social democracy.
He added he didn't stick to the position of First Vice-President.
"I will communicate my decision on November 10 to the FMC," said Hasek.
Similarly, Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and Head of the Jeroných Tejc Club spoke.
But he pointed out that he was elected just two days ago.
The two Members then declared that they would do their utmost to make the 50-member CSPD club sound one voice.
He put the crown of Michal Hasek on the Absurd Theatre: "I have been a member of the CSSSD for 15 years, always loyal to its brand and respected the decision of the party authorities."
So another lie on the air.
Or did he forget, in the call for Sobotko's resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, that August's UVPS decided 57% that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the Prime Minister's party?
The head of the CSDP, however, did not make a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday by calling the UVV.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with all sorts of gossip and rumors, possibly reminiscent of the real mistakes of Sobotko's political career.
There will be a powerful laundry wash, and there will be signs of dark alliances between the carboharmon Zdenek Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential attorney Radek Pokorný will discuss the friendship.
Disputes will explode in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the ČSSD.
The warning is the words of the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotko's ally Peter Caynar: "I signed Charter 77 so that idiots don't rule the country."
If the FMC met this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions in a ritual manner.
Traitors sprinkle ashes on their heads and stay.
And now the winning head of the CSRS will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a tiny smile, and then he just breathes out, "It's challenging."
The cooperation with the organization team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complicated, according to Martin the Doctor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much from the point of view of providing information on essential matters.
For example, we've been searching for three months to provide us with the official identification of individual villages, so that we can do a whole series of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating with this thing.
They're still communicating in a lot of things.
Is the Olympic village at least finished?
But it's not a catastrophic state anymore.
We walked around empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, that was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th as a vanguard, it'll still smell like glue.
And if they don't make it, what will?
You think President Putin would have chased an army in there?
I guess that's what's gonna happen.
Just so it's not that Olympic village = potemkin's village.
More likely, they don't have time to adjust their routes or finish the details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to bring our boots from the London Games.
But I do believe they'll get it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the figure skaters will be in the three-way.
No one has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I shouldn't be flying there until January 26th.
What houses in the Olympic village will look like, we know.
We even measured some of our own things on the subway so we don't just believe in sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the head of the mission do 100 days before the Olympic Games?
I'm preparing for the annual assessment of individual Olympic sports plus I'm doing a routine agenda in terms of communicating with the Sochi Organizing Committee.
Putin promised the environmental Olympics, a plan to crash a giant secret landfill.
Winter sports fans are already cutting a metre until the start of the Sochi Olympic Games, others are looking at their preparation with ever greater fears.
Russia's Olympics, even if they start in February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem unable to keep their promise that the preparation and holding of games will not in the slightest disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go in four months.
After all, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar, and Canadian games became the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to organising "zero waste" games seems to have been taken long ago.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a giant landfill of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
So they found a landfill full of construction material, tyres, canisters and insulation foam in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have been fading and the landfill has disappeared.
Only for a while.
Last week, reporters got a look at a dump the size of three football fields.
She's not the only one, there were several of them in the area, described by the British Times.
On the ground, Russian railways, a state monopoly, are working to build a 60-kilometer road between Sochi airport and the sports department.
A company that had already swallowed 280 billion rubles was led by one of Putin's close associates Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railroads fought back that one of the subcontractors set up the landfill.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the people of Akhštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the soc's water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimulov, a British newspaper from the environmental non-profit organisation EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian Organizing Committee and Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: games in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 cost $43 billion.
Last year's games in London only cost 19 billion and the said Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will eventually be enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working at the sports and infrastructure exhibitions.
Last month, one of the workers sewed up his mouth in protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers deal with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays in the Olympics.
Young couple mature to live with parents, new house offers privacy for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given as an assignment to design a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the property itself a bit of a balance.
The request further stated that two generations would live in the house that would want to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed an extra small office.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping property.
The architects therefore decided to place every household in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected the family ties, history, and memories associated with the site."
"Three different functions of the house are connected through several paths through the exterior of the building, so that everyone realizes the presence of others, but they have their privacy," explained the designers.
Parents' household is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree to which family traditions and memories bind.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in various final modifications of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been formed by means of planks panels, the part where the office is, is plastered in white and the remaining elements remain in clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
The parents' household, a kitchen, a dining room and a living room, is surrounded by a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
Interconnection of the interior with the exterior underlines the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
A kitchen space in a young couple's home.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there they climb the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominion of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to pass through them cascading through them.
That's what the architects were trying to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique.
The household of the young couple is considered as one open space with kitchen, dining room and living room together.
Only a glass wall with sliding doors separates it from the terrace.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed of one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the front door, finds themselves in the lobby and then climbs up the stairs from there.
Defend academic liberties, it applies to both Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, educators and high-school and high-school leaders in several counties to defend academic freedom from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've encountered more or less success.
Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the Honorary Chairman of SPOZ - Zeman in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of an uninvited invitation to celebrate the Czech Republic's public holiday.
Here is a list of school representatives who were no longer so brave and made it possible to visit Milos Zeman: University of Technology in Brno, Grammar School Lladnov in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice the continuation of policy enforcement in universities.
The newly elected Member for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post and, moreover, seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as staying as the mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the ČSSD's captains, who are simultaneously developing the role of a Member and a Member and, like them, degrade both professions?
Because you're telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions on the left-hand side.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hasek, who can even do a few dozen functions at once.
Well, that's probably not an example of the person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fáňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post in order to be fully committed to the management of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the office of Dean is that you will violate the political and political nature of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current presence on both positions as an advantage for the University.
But you will be able to help your "school" without remaining dean.
I think the same opinion I have and the rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count it for you in the next election.
And that doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice bubbly cabbage, chemistry does not add to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut want to be produced in the coming months in Slovakian Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
He's been making a healthy delicacy here since 1925 in a traditional way, i.e. by pedaling in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, it's a rarity.
Our workers will be trampled for a shift of nearly a mile.
15 to 30 tons of cabbage can be placed in each of the ten tanks, the filling of one takes three shifts, "said the director of the plant Slovakian Fruta David Kladroba.
Cabbages are transported directly from their fields to the premises of the company by farmers mainly from Ostrožska and Břeclav.
The fruit workers then clean the vegetables, remove the brooms and throw them in the ring.
From there already cut cabbage falls into swimming pools of 6 meters deep, in which tirelessly the pedals dressed in white clothing and boots work.
That's how they block out unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and loaded with water.
"The coriander is then aged six to eight weeks for spontaneous lactic fermentation without any addition of fermentation additives," said Director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, individual layers of workers sprinkle salt and cumin.
The cabbage goes to the filling line after the fermentation.
It is packed in a freshly acidic medium in sachets or glasses and subjected to sterilisation.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in the context of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a snitch from the American intelligence service, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to give evidence to the German Parliament if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
On Thursday, German Member Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, which was forwarded to the media on Friday in Berlin, it states: 'Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as a defection and tries to criminalise political speeches with heavy actions that do not give rise to defence'.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that supporting the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, said to Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make this possible."
Tension in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when the allegation that the NSA had been bugged by Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament who runs a parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there were any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness' without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US ', this should be done.
Mr Sträbel, a Member of Parliament for the German side of the Greens, published a photo of him and Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that, according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe," said the Member of Parliament.
In his letter, Mr Snowden said that he was facing a harsh and persistent campaign linked to persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said that the reaction of the world to his "act of political expression" gave him courage.
Citizens across the country and high-level officials - including those in the United States - have assessed the detection of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for the service of the public.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
We're sorry to kill you, but we're innocent, the Red Khmer's representatives defend us.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population at that time, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and executions.
To this commander, the infamous S-21 Penitentiary Tribunal for Cambodia, granted a life sentence in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interest of the nation and had no idea what the real extent of the killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority, "he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Red Khmer cadres to "treat people badly or to kill them, to deny them food or to commit genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Red regime, told AFP she couldn't accept Nuon Chea's apology. "
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be exonerated."
"She doesn't care about others," she said.
"Had he not given orders, his subordinates would not have killed," she added that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge were "worse than monsters."
The "Foreign Minister" of the regime of the Khmer Rouge, Ieng Sara, was also to stand before the court, but he died this March.
His wife Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, found the court incompetent in September 2012 due to dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Red Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 in its years for the deposit of hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand luggage and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new fee for hand luggage concerns luggage in the upper storage area, so that small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance, and USD 100 if the passengers with the payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
A spokesperson for Frontier Kate O'Malley stated that a $100 fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
The airlines started charging the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed them in hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no space in this space.
Charges are one way to teach passengers to take on board fewer things.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at Frontier's gate can bring in luggage for which he will pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queue for the same luggage will pay USD 100.
O'Malley said that the website and the handling procedures would be modified to ensure that passengers knew about the fee before they arrived at the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee will not be in force until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and the passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of losses.
Most of them didn't touch the hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for carry-on baggage three years ago and another low-cost Allegiant Air later followed its example.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's carry-on fee would generate USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met the unusual charge of Spirit for hand luggage.
"Getting on the plane was the most fluent thing I've ever seen in my career," he said.
I thought I'd see teeth squeaking and fighting at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the boarding took place in a flash."
Frontier will also apply the fee for coffee, tea, soda and juice following Spirit's model.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
The water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways tried briefly to introduce beverage charges, but after the complaints of passengers, it withdrew seven months later and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier's last move to charge for hand luggage, unless passengers purchase a flight directly from this airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay internet travel agents such as Orbitz from USD 10 to USD 25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so via Internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier has taken the farthest approach in this area.
In September, she started giving customers who bought through an Internet travel agency only half a mile within the loyalty program.
On Wednesday she cut the reward for the miles flown to 25 percent of the miles from the route.
So a trip with Frontier, a thousand miles long bought through an Internet travel agency, is worth 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seats in advance only if they make purchases directly via Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
The Republic is also trying to solve Frontier's financial problems by selling this airline.
The NSA doesn't blame hackers for the fall of the website, but "internal error."
The secret National Security Agency said last Friday that her website fell for a few hours last week because of an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some said on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," said the spy agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be solved by tonight.
The claim that the blackout was caused by a DDoS attack (distributed service rejection) is not true.
Earlier this evening, the online server sensors recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site is no longer accessible to some users.
Previously, NSA spokesperson at ABC News reported that the agency's internal sensitive networks were "not at all" at risk.
The spokesman said that no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists online claimed to be responsible for the exclusion of NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the site falls down.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA supersecret agency, which once acquired the nickname No such agency, has, in recent months, become the focus of public attention following the unveiling of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and the focus of biting criticism, collectively the product of the theft of NSA secret files from the Agency and their disclosure by the disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profits fell due to a drop in supplies and orders
The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15% decrease in net profit on Thursday due to a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not published any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times and the question arose whether the test phase progressed well.
The results did not deliver, and the stock market stock in Toronto dropped by 8 percent.
On Thursday, the State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating from "higher profitability" to "sector performance," expecting the stock market to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While smaller aircraft supplies were mostly expected, the profit margin in the field of transport disappointed us greatly," said Doerksen in the report to the clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new CSeries aircraft orders.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market's scepticism towards this programme will rise.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will fight to the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was detected in March and, after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches modest 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and savings on the costs of this transport aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The executive director Pierre Beaudoin expected that Bombardier would achieve its target of 300 binding orders when putting the first aircraft into commercial use.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and media that the programme was progressing as planned.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in the conference call and noted that the ground checks and software updates were planned during the shutdown of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates, and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test planes should take off in the coming weeks and the others shortly thereafter.
The analysts are still skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier argues that it has assessed its plan for putting the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests - although consistent with Bombardier's internal plan - will probably strengthen our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
Of USD 172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, in the third quarter ending on 30 September, Bombardier's net profit fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share.
Adjusted yields per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover has fallen marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters' analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claimed that, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, only 45 aircraft were supplied during the quarter in question.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
The outstanding contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32,9 billion on 30 September, which is also unchanged as of 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but the low receipt of orders and the overall state of the market failed us," said Beaudoin.
The revenues in the aviation industry have fallen by 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that the yield in this division rose by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Unmet transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion on 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was influenced by the problems with the implementation of several major contracts.
Leaders have stated that new perspectives will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced the arrival of Google's financial director Patrick Picchette, declined by 8.5 percent during trading on Thursday afternoon to USD 4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and Bombardier's closest competitor, announced a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in jail.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information to the king of the underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug mobster of a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42), after becoming suspected of using cocaine, was to pass sensitive information to Neil Scarbrough's boss about his drug smuggling activities.
A lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (party), who was celebrated as the best legal counsel by criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance of Scarborough, who he represented in previous narcotics proceedings.
The police spotted Sarborough (32) leaving three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, which was just having dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on the tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he sought to obtain information on the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were followed up at the time in a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire regions.
After the police arrested about GBP 1.5 million of heroin and cocaine during a series of raids, along with GBP 200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) passed information on to criminals for fear of finding out about his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works with the law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, has had a shameful time in front of the Liverpool Crown Court when, after three weeks of trial, he was found guilty of obstructing the administration of justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall occurred after Scarborough's police investigation revealed that he was in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and spotted him placing 60 percent clean drugs under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently he was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular phone conversation.
The lawyer came home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two people.
The court said that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but he denied cocaine use, and he said that he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation was "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
In a police interview, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that clients visited him for work matters at home.
However, the court heard that, following key arrests, it contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom it had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "Who else is more aware that they must not violate the law than legal counsel in criminal matters."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as attorney and of being in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation has thwarted as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta did not bring good repute to his profession, but he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta refused the offense and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done so immediately."
However, after the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr Ditta himself became a criminal in criminal matters when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organised crime groups who gave him the task of gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must stick to the highest principles of integrity and are to inspire confidence and the feeling that they can rely on them in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Major and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire has led an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also sentenced for three cases of cocaine possession and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We will find you and put you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta held an online interview about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a guest at dinner he would like Mohammed Ali and as an incentive to work he stated inequality.
He was negotiating government with Klaus and Spidla.
Now the people of John Kasal have sent against Babish.
In the elections, the People's Party received 14 Members, only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of YES.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that had already begun to argue the contexts of a possible coalition, Jan Kasal - a man who matched the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrei Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This will probably be a reminder of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a whole new party.
"Experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a terrifying report and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said the newspaper that considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is the extended hand of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to Star, the bill effectively passes on to the government "full control of the media," and the standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "took a hard hit," and criticises the bill as "strict."
The approval of the bill comes in the midst of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the Islamic shooter's September attack at Westgate Shopping Center.
The authorities' anger turned to the Kenyan media when it broadcast a security camera footage on which soldiers sent to the site allegedly looted a luxury store.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and a media manager for questioning, but the subpoena was later withdrawn from the press force.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of "removal from the list" or can be denied official press accreditation.
The General Court shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "one fine is enough to destroy most radio stations."
It is also stated that these measures may have a winding-up effect on what is called the Kenyan "live blogosphere."
Politicians know that when they shut up the media, they can do what they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," wrote the journalist Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it up to politicians, they'll bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
The law-makers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts imposed by the national wage agency and to restore their fat salaries to around 532,000 untaxed shillings per month, which are thus among the highest in the world.
Save it, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea what interest they're paying.
More and more Czechs put their money aside.
Yet they do not reach the champions of saving in the region.
The Austrian people who save EUR 181 per month on average save the most money on the side.
A little more than Czechs will save even people in Slovakia.
This follows from the Erste Savings Barometer survey in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that savers' mood is improving, and two-thirds of the respondents plan to set aside more money.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia, people saving products still use very little.
For example, almost every other Serb will save "under the pillow" at home according to the survey.
In the country this year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased.
Even last month, 26 percent of respondents had to spend between a thousand and 2.5 thousand crowns each month on a variety of savings, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly deposit in the year-on-year comparison, however, decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is the supplementary pension insurance.
This prefers 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, and the interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to last year.
Only 16 percent of the respondents use these, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The survey also showed that, although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what yields they are making on individual products.
Above all, young people under the age of 30 do not know how much their money is interest-bearing.
On the contrary, the oldest group of people asked questions have the best knowledge of the profitability of their stored money, 73% of people over the age of 50 know that.
In international comparison, Erste Czechs are leading the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12% distance.
The UN celebrates the new objectives of combating poverty
The United Nations is starting to work without delay on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) that were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDG, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that now is the time to "rise above national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over a process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development - SDG," he said.
The SDG will build on the progress made within the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the Development Programme after 2015.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of sustainable development objectives, which is based on the success of the MDG.
Concerns about the safety of Mozambique are escalating due to a conflict of strong personalities.
Under the statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique President of the Founder, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to proclaim peace passwords at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
For fear of the future of her country, she traded her corporate clothing for a T-shirt decorated with "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Square of Independence in the capital.
For two weeks, reports have come almost daily of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo Party, one of the worst fights since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia, and then the apartheid government in South Africa, in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that there will be an open conflict in the country again, but recent events have startled foreign investors and local investors.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, because the discoveries of large offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest over the next few years can bring more than $50 billion in investment from companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and US Anadarko.
The ruling party, Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have accused each other of the tension that has arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the government triggered the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala on 17 September, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault of the former rebels then culminated when government forces attacked Renamo's base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said to the Financial Times spokesman for Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accusing Renamo of starting conflicts because he said it was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to ease the fear of instability.
On Wednesday, Mr Guebuza said to the French press office AFP that Mr Dhlakami saw himself as a "loser," who wanted to use "anything left of his might to try to prove that he could order the government to make his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But the concern grew when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo Party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He said to France Télécom that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our aim is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
The previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate the tensions between these parties, fueled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It's a brawl between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlaky), said the tutor at Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which sought election changes, has already said that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial gain from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), founded by former member of the Renamo Party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza - whose second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a democratic system of multiple parties, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to release the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what possibilities the Renamo Party has, but it has carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and the south.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack this line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique was not good," said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development, and recent floods of abductions.
"People think that responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find a solution to the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says that people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for the way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that "brute force cannot be equal to clever cunning," while Artušov legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would "be too wild for school education, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene," said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of appropriate age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly instructive" authors and teachers are at a captivating story with a "subthreshold" message for children as a "switch."
Crossley-Holland, which of Anglo-Saxon translated the Epos Beowulf and which also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and British national legends, says, "You can have good intentions, but you'll do better if you keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended with a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; exposed through a story, not openly determined.
The old truth that it's better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory takes visitors into space in a new digital
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can dig into new comfortable seats and over their heads a projection area 17 meters in diameter in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order for the image to be perfect, other smaller projectors are distributed across the hall.
Another important part of the facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is twenty-one computers that generate the painting," said the director of the Brno observatory Jiří Dusek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a comprehensive impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classic personal computers," said the technician from the observatory Tomáš Hladek.
The digital can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of night sky, human body or ocean floor.
The audience gets so caught up right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a man.
Another similar device is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project the purchased shows and its own production in the hall.
Two shows have been on the agenda since Saturday.
The first one is called the Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People learn about astronaut training, fly into space, turn to centrifuge, and then, in illustrative examples, see how difficult the astronauts are facing in space.
The second show is for children and is called the Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a reef whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano exploded.
The whole digital industry cost about CZK 50 million, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost 10 million crowns, the projector 12 million.
"The rest swallowed by audiovisual technology and computers," Dusek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the observatory went through two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 TIMES OF INSERATORS!
We know where they want you to go to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11 000 adverts offering a job, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 adverts (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is therefore becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was carried out for the first time, its share was 26%.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it stabilised at around 60%.
According to the analysis, the advertising of labour opportunities largely reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of adverts published in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 advertisements were published in the same reference period, less than half in 2012.
The offer of Internet jobs is oriented towards a narrower group of professions, in particular a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including the workers, mentioned by the author of the analysis of Pavlína Štěnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, advertisements looking for managers and managers, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the lead.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, while large representation belongs mainly to the service and worker professions.
Of course, education is among the most frequently mentioned demands expressed by employers through advertising.
Other areas of interest included knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, the requirement to know a foreign language was given in three percent of the advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of advertisements did employers demand active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Entitlements for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40% of advertisements (11% per day print, 57% on the Internet).
Experience in the field was required in 54% of advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally linked to qualified professions.
These are in particular production managers and other managers.
In particular, the workers' professions are mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical equipment, added by the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employers also specify in the middle of their advertisements the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most frequently required skills, communication skills appear in the first place in advertising in the long term.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to gathered people by means of an interview.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
The festival founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy institution Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too big to be played in the club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," the annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform among others.
Just as this festival has spread, the world of comedy has spread.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has stepped up with his sitcom (a cheerful "League" on a fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but she was most famous for the rapidly spreading series of Marcel the shell with shoes on.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, bitchy, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest drivers of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will speak to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful TV and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he held a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting is held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he walks down the aisle between two buildings and thinks, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
The price of oil went down to $96 a barrel.
On Friday, oil prices continued to decline, as high stock concerns were balanced by the report, which showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The US oil index for December deliveries during the late morning fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European electronic trading on the New York trading market.
On Thursday was a 39-cent drop, and for October he remained 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have been burdensome in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, the Department of Energy declared that US supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the last week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports on Chinese production, the stimulus came to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after the two previous weak decades of growth at 7.8% in the third quarter.
Brent oil, an indicator for international oil also used by American refineries, fell 26 cents on the London International Trade Exchange at $108.58 a barrel.
Oh, no, Mr. Hasek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not how it is.
There must be enough pressure to relieve Martin Hasek of all political functions and leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so low.
Martin Hasek is shielded by the promise he has made, but everyone and a politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of that promise and very much consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš also has a material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr Hasek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm it, if you weren't lying - you can see how difficult it is to lie), you leave politics alone as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, even flawed person or a lifetime of being a bitch.
It may seem unfair to you that I address only you, but you are a leader and they are just misguided sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to lower your ears for a while, regroup your strength, sit through the shame and then attack again, but that's how guerrillas or backstabbers behave.
You are, I repeat, a leader in your eyes, an alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court has blocked the regulation on the procedure for stopping and searching persons by the NYPD Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked a court order requesting changes in the program to stop and search persons in the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
The second US appeals federal court said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the decision of appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of stopping and questioning people.
The city attacked its conclusions and its corrective regulations, including a decision to assign supervision to the police department to help change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday for the requested postponement.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be removed from the case because she was in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge according to the requirement to avoid the appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement which she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanic as part of their program to stop and search people.
It has established independent supervision to oversee major changes, including reform in procedures, training and supervision, and to order the launch of a pilot programme to test body-borne cameras in certain areas where the most frequent stopping is taking place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of maintaining the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after the police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is planned sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons were criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there have been stops and searches for people for about a number of decades, but recorded tours under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have grown dramatically to a record number of 684.330 in 2011, in most cases black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a group action case.
The advocates of changing the programme of stopping and searching the police department in New York say that changes will put an end to unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use these procedures.
Opponents claim that changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but will not solve a wider problem where the police force is under pressure after its numbers have decreased by several thousand people over the last decade.
The judge noted that it did not end the practice of stopping and searching persons who are constitutional, but reformed the way in which the New York Police Department conducted the inspections.
A fifth of shopping malls face low traffic
This results from data from real estate consultancy companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Trade Centre Krakow is open to the public in Prague Bohemia, the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now 90 large business centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance concerns about 20 percent of medium and large centres.
The main problems are an inadequately large centre for location and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and opaque layout of passages, or dead places of centers, "said Michal Sták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also according to the head of retail property department Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the business centers are dealing with low traffic.
The main reasons include, inter alia, poor transport availability, low local population income category or oversaturation of the market at the site.
Some projects were open almost fully, but their results were largely unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.
The new business centers must try more to 'attract' their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events, "Samadi added.
The occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable according to Soták, even rising at some centres, because the tenants were willing to discount the rent in the crisis and to accompany some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened up that are not fully occupied and the average occupancy thus reduces (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantova in Olomouc)," added Sták.
The business centres opened up in the last two years have been pushing the market very slowly, according to Sylvie Samadi.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
In Prague, for example, we see a space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called 'convinience centres', aimed at shopping and services of daily needs for the population living in the immediate surroundings, "Samadi said.
According to Stak, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
This is for small service centres as well as large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," added Sták.
In Prague they see a space for a prepared business centre in the Victory Square, and they also have the clear potential of the street Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developed, which allow traders to cover and expand to smaller cities at favourable rent and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior commercial houses, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of gross rental space.
A quarter of all these shopping malls are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, results from Incoma GfK's data.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked his phone to check his tip.
Former newspaper editor News of the World (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of "hacking into the phone, tracking and confronting" to confirm a fraudulent tip on the love relationship that Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in at the time.
Prosecutor Andrew Etis at the Old Bailey Court said that News of the World reported false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspapers have instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and infiltrate her privacy, but the court said Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The State's Attorney suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing in front of the house hoping to catch people outside, but a person who likes to give people stories to see what they have to say," said Mr Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, he knows about the other one, the surveillance, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "Of course he knows."
Rumors of a love relationship that Clarke was involved in were first captured by the NotW news department when the source that was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was said, "You're wasting your time, that's with Charles."
Recording with voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcaire's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator's computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information on Pawlby, said Mr Edis.
Meanwhile, former Chief Rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Mrs Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005 saying, "I got a story we're about to publish tomorrow, which Charles and I would love to talk about."
Mr. Etis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court said Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about a love affair with a married woman while he himself was seeing the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks contested the association with other persons for the purpose of hacking phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
NSA exposure increases the social paranoia of state surveillance
One peaceful day, at the end of August, a German police helicopter was buzzing over the American consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the instruction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the American advance patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, America's National Intelligence Director, again insisted in September that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But ever since Edward Snowden, who has become a co-worker, has begun to uncover his valuable secret surveillance collection by the United States, European governments, and leading businessmen, they no longer know whether to trust the words of the director.
After reports that the US National Security Agency has conducted espionage in a Brazilian oil company and has gained access to the data available to US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, has achieved widespread paranoia about state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came in with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was probably bugged for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the potential targets are also the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of BitMi, who represents a small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
According to a survey conducted in July by the EY advisory service, German companies believe that, in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much risk as China.
However, there is so far no evidence in the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has passed on trade secrets to foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet skills and have said that it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The leading businessmen are skeptical of that.
There are voices from the German Parliament that we should make German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical refinement of US espionage agencies revealed by Snowden is still shocking for some companies who have thought China was the biggest threat to surveillance.
There is a huge turn in cloud computing, where European leaders have become aware to a wider extent that data stored in the US fall under its jurisdiction and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-American members, after the US Prism data mining program was discovered, cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider.
Jim Snabe, one of the SAP Directors General, says, "Do we have a new question for customers who weren't here a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is no surprise.
It's always been happening.
"It has been a crucial topic for many years, and it has not changed significantly during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agri-chemical company BASF.
Americans are doing espionage on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are doing espionage on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have taken so that they may not give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Automotive Board, says that for many years it has been common practice to collect mobile phones before a board meeting to make it impossible to use them as a listening device.
The German BfV advises executives to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign roads because of the risk that smart phones can be embezzled.
Pre-paid cell phones are then thrown out.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leading representatives of the global market in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorised access," warns BfV in its report.
The US warns its own companies of other countries' economic espionage.
According to the Washington post-American documents, the National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France alongside Russia and Israel, in the second row, the perpetrators involved in hacking activities for economic rapporteurs, just behind China.
A member of the board in a German risk-free society concluded that, in terms of economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: "The services know very well that all countries, even though they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Parents of a minor Georgie boy who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a minor Georgie boy whose body was found inside a confused wrestling ghost in his high school gym, believes their son was murdered, said family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found cursed on January 11 in a flat ghost behind the bleachers at the high school gym where he went.
Sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old refuses.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said the lawyer Benjamin Crump for FoxNews.com, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They believe it contradicts logic, physical laws and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's supposed to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned in a body bag," he said.
Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
He announced Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told the press that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of "posture asphyxiation."
The second autopsy, however, according to Moore, indicated a different cause of death.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if, in the case of Johnson's death, he discovers enough evidence for a warrant to investigate a crime or violate civil rights, he will request the FBI and implement it.
A deputy from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance video the investigators examined.
Juvenile parents are hoping that video footage will contain a clue as to how their son died.
The CDC Centre has issued allergy guidelines for schools in children
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of directives to help in the case of children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the US Government, because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about child food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if any.
Also, schools are advised to have adrenaline available - the most commonly used EpiPen automatic injector - to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature recently updated the rules allowing schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The baby can say, "It's like someone's fucking my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "My tongue itches."
Parents of intersex children may choose "indefinite sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third gender in children born with ambiguous sex patterns.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to list any sex for such children and allows them to refer to their birth certificates as "indeterminate" or "unspecified."
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to hastily opt for an operation to determine sex, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One intersexual person, according to the BBC, after many years, said, "I am neither man nor woman."
I will remain a fallow created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year, 2000 children are born one, which is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, an overarching term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery is carried out, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determining issues, said the new German law "seems like a good thing."
Intersex children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children do not," he said.
The sex can be determined without surgery, and then it can wait for the identity to develop.
Knowledge of how a child develops sexual affinity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery of why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as being different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not linked to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically composed of both and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and body, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sex organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the work area, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark male, female or "third sex" in official documents.
In June, Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person when she won a legal appeal to retain the status of "indefinite" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports, except for M (man) and F (woman), will also have a third designation, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to the news report, the 24 gender issue is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
American websites, Catholic online, have also defined and written against German law: "With the world being dragged into a new state where gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization upside down."
A newborn mother from Maryland also said to Baby Zone that she would rather see children be given gender at birth.
"Parenthood itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she spoke to the parent-care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek who had double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that gender was something like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation, saying that sexual affinity is a complex matter, and sometimes doctors can make the wrong choice because they don't know how children will feel about their sex when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The continuing theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was submissive.
He created a new concept of "sexual affiliation" and argued that social causes and environmental influences - as parents raised their child - affected children's genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in a case in 1966, known as "John / Joan," his theory became questionable.
The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to a poorly circumcised circumcision recommended that they have their child castrated completely, removed his testicles as well and raised him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," said Drescher.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had to be operated on back to the boy and married to a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" today.
But in the 1990's, with the Internet coming, the survivors of these operations appeared "dissatisfied with the outcome."
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but an ambiguous sex machine.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a big clit or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfactory life."
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
At 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said for ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent to a vagina surgery at 18.
But because he was depressed and he knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After I was born, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to develop its sex organs properly.
After he learned the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone and had his breasts removed,
Surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the head of the Advocate for Informed Choice legal group, is concerned that the German law "calls for branding and stigmats."
"Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose" vague "for the child," she said.
We're afraid it'll call for intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because it "allows adults to choose to be classified as a third sex."
"An adult should be able to make his own decision on a legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is about to allocate it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child should not seduce at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would "grant" powers to both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgen numbness syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie's feminine features have evolved.
He's got a vagina, but he's got no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, 29-year-old Katie is married and, in her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as an intern at a children's psych ward.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush their decision," said Baratz.
It gives them time to run certain tests and to think about it, and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman."
In this respect, everything is fine - you're raising your child and loving it.
You have a wonderful child and you're enjoying it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings the possibility of involving a child in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that the parents tie up because they have no certainty that they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child decides which sex he identifies with more - and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk spilled gasoline all over the house: he threatened to burn it down with his own family!
Tension was increasing, fear was increasing.
A man threatened to burn the house down.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as a unit of fire fighters from Mladá Bloslav and a unit of voluntary fire brigade, have therefore arrived at the site.
A police negotiator who tried to talk a man out of his irrational behavior also arrived at the scene.
The man continued to threaten to burn the house down.
So a task force must have broken into the house that took out the men and restrained them.
The aggressor then ended up being examined at a young-age hospital, from where he was taken to an alcoholic detention station.
The firefighters eventually filled the house with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all pets were also rescued from the house in addition to persons.
A man didn't put a man on a police negotiator, followed by a task force.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisor, according to the New York Times, has secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 candidate.
This discovery is the most important sensation of the eagerly awaited book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine received a copy of the upcoming book and announced on Thursday night that the President's senior associates held intense group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to see if getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hope of re-election.
According to the national-political correspondent for Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact of the election on the transfer of former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of Vice President.
Potential change was a strictly guarded secret within Chicago's campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisors - including Daley, former Obama's campaign leader Jim Messina, and former chief advisors at the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was a representative of trying to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not significantly increase Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was actually considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I have studied many things intensively and this was one of them," he spoke for Daley.
You can't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we were like, "Jesus Christ, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley described research as "due diligence," Martin told Anderson Cooper at CNN that the re-election campaign had made considerable investments to see if this move would pay off in the election.
"In campaigns, there is no such money to spend on elections and qualitative research, unless something is seriously considered," said Martin at AC360.
But it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential card shuffle.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential changes, the former head of office admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on removing Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," said Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a shining treat.
He came up with the idea when he read the expert treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes lighting.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue - increases the pH level of the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of "Lick me I'm delicious" ice cream company, says, "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for £200, you get about 2 grams of it."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH rises, and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the past few months, and it seems like a great idea for Halloween, because it's causing this fantastic radiant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the lighting of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every scoop costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold petals.
But his next product should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
Basically, it's impossible because of the refraction of the light caused by the ice crystals that make ice cream, but I'm counting on us to find some way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially manufactured by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a cheap guy.
For two years, there hasn't been any candy in my apartment, and this year probably won't be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, in terms of Halloween, a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year most Americans will be celebrating Halloween - in fact 158 million of them - and spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But every Halloween I look forward to, there are trends.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion of spent dollars is expected to go into costumes.
This year, the latest fad of fashion is sexy, inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; hot food can be like pizza, hamburger, and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men of Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans are spending $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So you're gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is amazing news for 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the US Department of Commerce, are going to ambush our neighborhoods.
In fact, we buy during Halloween, and believe it or not, we consume 45 million kilos of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association around Halloween, they sell almost 16,000 tons.
That's about nine billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror behind the walls" and "The house of shock."
In fact, there are in the United States officially dedicated 1200 haunted houses that, according to the American haunted houses, have a $500 million profit, and that includes those amazing photos that you're peeing in fear and that your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like is going to look at the picture and write a comment like "pretty face."
And finally a little bit about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the great pumpkin and carving pumpkin lantern is kind of like decorating a Christmas tree - we've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend started only last year with Pinterest, so most of us grew up with the fact that we were carving the gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the Census Office in the United States, Americans are spending about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting up their pumpkin weighing almost a ton.
Announcement of a series of racing Land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as intercommunication equipment.
The choice is improved brakes, service package ensuring access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The participants in the races that come to Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as an attainable path to world class races.
We are pleased to offer them this trip in cooperation with the Land Rover and the MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and to prepare the contestants for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the possibility of competing in desert races in the north of Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
Chairman TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections.
A week after the last one in the interview for Headline.cz said that there is no other way out and every government that came out of last Friday's vote and Saturday is an impossible blind spot.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, stating that the lifetime of the starting term is estimated within two years.
The objection that voters will hardly choose any other way next time does not agree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not accept that his party may still lose voters in the next election, as it did this year (about 300,000 votes from 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear within two months that early elections would be held, it would strengthen Andrei Babiš's movement ANO 2011.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The turbulent situation in ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party's leadership, stated that he, or Michal Hasek, will remain in charge of social democracy, commenting on Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"The leaders of the democratic party as the little boys follow the head of state to allow them to overthrow the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I have never seen something so badly done in my life," added TOP 09.
And in the direction of President Zeman (whom he met in the struggle for presidential office), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to take over the party."
The first laws have already been passed by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise in the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Faroe Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House Committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
The president of TOP 09 in an interview for Headline.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed."
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to beat similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the election leader of ANO Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of the idea of introducing a contract register "robbing" the YES programme.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - simply dusting up a proposal that was already set in the second reading of the House.
The fire brigade came to rescue the lost puppy, which was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in the quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a little car accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog saw him trapped in a quarry.
The firemen were raiding the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by fire units that came to rescue it after it somehow trapped itself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month-old Spaniard Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days alone until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) with his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the quarry Flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet with Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they feverishly searched for their lost dog and placed challenges on social media.
On Wednesday at about 14.15, a bright-cut doggie saw Ruby trapped on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station hurried to the site and sank down to liberate Ruby, using the animal transport bag to pick him up from the rock.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
In the rescue, he didn't move - he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual call.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team, Peter Lau, said, "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very badly injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a tour, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall from Halifax in West Yorkshire said, "I was scared watching the rescue."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in my arms again.
The vet said if he ran out too much and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't go out.
During the interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" from 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he came on to her.
And she said, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement from Thursday Jagger (70), the deputy said that he categorically refused to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the visiting singers (singers) who showed up on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" was debut this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that its entry into Schengen would be a condition for an independent Scotland in the EU.
This gave rise to stories about passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this was not reflected in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws, if that suits them.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continuing disharmony would be a cheap concession for Brussels for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old that he became an excavation, a newspaper duck that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet in this bearded tale there is an interesting thought.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade London for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
As a result of the euro crisis, the so-called Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, the parties dedicated to opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative to Germany - founded this year - came out of nowhere and already captured nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, essentially "Free Democrats" (equivalent to British Liberal Democrats).
There has always been resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe on home soil.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with a straitjacket attached to national economies through clinging to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit - only in Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenues and public spending - which Germany encourages.
In the face of the current budgetary and currency problems, there is a deeper cause for Europe's weak performance.
As a result of the 'green' energy policy supported by Brussels - the code for supporting French and German companies at consumer costs - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for petrol as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even the freezing of wages in the world would not prevent the trampling of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering mutiny, especially in France, once enthusiastic EU supporters.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand at Washington level in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a testament to political legitimacy, and has pursued its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and has put the ruling socialists in third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - early warning for British labor that they cannot assume that the fission of the right will automatically be positive on the left.
How does Le Pen treat her newfound popularity among the white working class?
Next year's European elections would like to use it to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
It occurs to me that, in the near future, a growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will come together and destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn into something more free in the sense of "Europe (sovereign) nations," which General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Great Britain to distance itself from this project and to be attached to the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (basically) of small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - this includes the possibility of announcing Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would have done well in Europe's relaxed arrangements, provided it had retained its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement not promoting austerity in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition attitude towards the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to take the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Teenage: Advanced Early
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is coming.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this
Experts say that one of the triggers of early puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so evident in boys.
Former CNN rapporteur Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter's breasts start growing and hair on the bends at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatric Physicians this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time making sure my parents weren't usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair on the bends and armpits and body odour, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age of first menstruation.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breasts start to develop, at least two to three years will elapse before the first menstruation," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Early puberty in girls: Necessary Guide for coping with this frequent problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is the time.
It is discussed what activates the actual beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before 8 years of age, the girl is considered "prematurely mature."
In most cases, the process is slowed down or stopped - this can be closely monitored by children's physicians.
A faster growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of bones, which may eventually lead to a cessation of growth and scarcity in adulthood.
Recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug deployment, Kaplowitz is cautious, but recognises that "suppression of puberty can alleviate the behavior problems of a girl and her feelings that she is different from her peers."
Another big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have periods.
"They are concerned that he may become pregnant, or how he will manage hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter began her period at the age of 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't ready emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys - like girls - achieve puberty sooner.
Caplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001 he helped carry out a study on girls aged 6 to 9, which combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although pubic hair appears at a low age in boys, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as that of girls.
Other doctors participating in the American Association of Children's Physicians (AAP) conference added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.
"We must be careful how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from Goryeba Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from their child doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child before you would expect it," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who have evolved before need assurances that even if they do so prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadya Konvalinková as innkeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadya Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar and was very good at it.
Maybe the popular Czech actress was planning to change her profession and go into business in a pub?
Nadya Konvalinková appeared at James Joyce Irish Pub and made a beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
My boss even offered to hire me, and I could spin beer for a living.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I do today, at acting, "said Konvalinková, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey every now and then," revealed her taste as an actress.
A long-time friend and colleague of Pavel Nové also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I'm not allowed to drink in my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I'm trying to follow that, "added the actor.
Aircraft manufacturers argue about the width of seats, big orders are at stake
There was a dispute over the width of seats in the second grade between the leading aircraft manufacturers for long-distance flights, which this month gave rise to a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-distance flights for the economic class - not the one that would normally be preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called this week for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class, but America's main rival Boeing says that airlines should decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-distance aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is distributed - especially whether there are 9 seats or 10 seats - is the basis of economic performance requirements for the design of new "mini-jumbo 'aircraft.
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm in 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out by 9.
Giant aeroplanes often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to gain advantage with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
He recently showed what could be the launch of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a picture showing three people in a restaurant with the title "Would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in narrower seats than those in regional turbo-propeller aircraft," said Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
As the eating patterns change, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, to the turn of the century, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the US Health Department.
According to American medical statistics, the average American has a waist of 100 cm in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it has conducted research which suggests that the expansion of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus's seats and says that it is not within the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It really is about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things that they believe must be done to be successful," said Kent Craver, an expert in cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, greater space for elbows is essential, but for suppliers, it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute is a race in orders for aircraft with estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to deflect the scales of American and European exports.
As Reuters stated in July, the layout of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they achieve 20% better efficiency in their latest proposals for two-engine long-range aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend partly on the comparison of the design of the 777X model with 10 seats in a row and the concept 777 with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to crowd more seats, and make his aircraft more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, who is the passenger comfort manager at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing models 777 are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for denser distribution, which can go hand in hand with lower charges.
"Forty-five centimeters wide passenger seat would be great, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus, the design is motivated by the threat of model 777," said the expert on the interior of Mary Kirby's cabin, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
The travel aircraft dealers even carry a measuring zone to check the competitive arrangement.
While enjoying comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for a greater adaptation of the cabin by offering wider seats in the alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that, without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but can discourage the 777X wave of sales.
The number of HIV infected has exceeded a thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is growing every year.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed an infection in 50 people, 5 years later there were 121, and by 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected, and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases exceeds 200 this year, I think there is no doubt about it," said Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him last January to September, 165 patients with HIV were added in the country, 176 of them this year over the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of this September, the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, the most infected being in Prague.
Their numbers reached 1005 in September.
206 were infected in the Central Bohemian Region.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region and 116 from Ústecký.
The least infected came from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have had blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
With the HIV virus, six children were also born, transferred to them from their mother.
The nonsense in Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, the experts say
Fantastic film from the universe Gravity sold out cinema in the Czech Republic some time after the premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, almost 150,000 spectators saw him and made over CZK 26 million.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
Others, however, have some discrepancies.
The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I like scientific and fantastic films, which I consider modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not include, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
He's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice Sandra Bullock's hair, which doesn't kind of show up in a weightless state.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station move along significantly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the real effect and the whole behaviour of the fire in a weightless state.
They don't think the scafanders could withstand that kind of blow either.
Heroes in Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and suits without much difficulty.
Critics were not spared even the plot of the plot.
Such a large tragedy in the orbit of the Earth is, according to some, unrealistic.
Plus, they're wondering why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technique.
People argue in forums about "unreal" behavior of ropes.
They say it looks like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium of Prague): I have only seen it on a wide screen, but I can clearly say I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost the duty) not to stick to reality consistently.
"More than you mentioned, I was touched by the fact that a space station with a degrading level of technique (last Chinese) is shown three times."
"Besides, China won't be here until the end of the decade, and it'll probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in not breaking the laws of physics, and so the naturalized viewer will appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and collisions the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved, said by the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the polar glow flashing in the polar regions.
I'm sure there will be inconsistencies in the more detailed examination.
In addition, when reading comments, for example, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit appeared to be reversed in some scenes than should actually be the case (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but none of the fundamental and calling crimes against logic or natural laws have been recorded in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, it is obvious that the creators have taken care of the credibility of the displayed events.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that Hubble's space telescope is orbiting differently from the ISS.
As a result, there is a considerable difference in speed between the two, and therefore the rescue operation could not actually have been carried out as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) separation, I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New nicotine vaccine can remove pleasure from smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can remove the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of vaccine could protect a mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human trials, we need to run additional tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available today on the market, but have found that their nicotine dependence is so strong to overcome all the current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to produce antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a continuous stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies pursue all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine intervention.
During the tests of the vaccinated mouse, which was subsequently supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren't vaccinated, "calmed down," said the researchers, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brain.
Experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given often enough to maintain sufficient antibody levels so that they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette to prevent nicotine addiction.
But it would be much more likely for smokers to use it to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, because of nicotine vaccine, they will not enjoy it, and that will help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies the influence of Obeid.
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of coastal renting at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on a government-controlled property.
On Friday, the Independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) extended its search to see if Mr Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to rent out to Circular Quay, where the Obeides owned two restaurants and cafés, renewed without having to take part in the selection procedure after its expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeid's secret interests in these properties, on the basis of evidence submitted on Thursday by the former Deputy Head of the Office of Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of the talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, leases for enterprises in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeides $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in the tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a competitive competitor.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of calls submitted at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the topic of interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial leases policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy, Mr Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military planes attacked a target in Syria, said responsible agent
Israeli military planes hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, confirmed by a responsible official of the Fox News administration.
This responsible factor specifically did not say what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Press Agency, the Associated Press, states that the target was SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out an air strike on the supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Maybe the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it could be agreed, while Chairman Štěch was stirring up a feud.
The Hetman was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and he is a symbol of the misery of the CSPD to continue.
The other gentlemen have demonstrated their weaknesses in particular.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaoralek has made the most impossible conversation on television.
On this basis, I see no better option than for the CSPD to propose the Vice-President of Senate Gajdůšková as Prime Minister, the only one who would not have an initial handicap, and I think it would have done a standard performance.
That is such a good solution, that hardly anyone from the board will support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could without fear build a minority government with a mere blessing from President Babiš and without the people's people, but with the human health minister Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability, because it would have enforced a proper referendum law, and so the President of the Dawn of the Okamura would have pledged to support it.
In the end, President Babish would accept the tax progression, for he is sharp and will see that it cannot be done without it.
People wouldn't cause trouble, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they wouldn't be in government.
The same applies to YES, there would also be a valuable minister, but if they do not reasonably want to enter into risky government participation, they will provide support, too, well.
Let's give the courage to Alena Gaiduschek!
Foreign visa-authorised personnel may undergo a "legitimacy test"
As the government intends to extend police procedures, it is considering a test of "legitimacy" for foreign workers with a visa authorisation of 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 from being used to fulfil unskilled jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government debate article was published today, former Labour Member Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers saying that it might offend Australian neighbors.
"Loud statements" at the end of the queue "and" work first for the Australians "are a very unpleasant remnant of the time when the unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white labor force was to be protected - and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region has recorded an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article analyses the 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
The immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he deals with officials for human smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes, and the rest remain to be considered.
Where the criteria for "eligibility" are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking."
After previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers, but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, seeking asylum, died with suspicion of a heart attack after arriving this week on a asylum ship to the Christmas Islands.
A man's nine-year-old scared son traveled to Australia with him and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship after his father's death on Wednesday.
The Australian authorities and a man rushed to the hospital on the Christmas islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the advantages of HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said that the project "will bring Great Britain together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was working with the British government on this plan "enthusiastic."
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase Two, the line will lead from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted talks with the National Transport Agency Transport Scotland, mandated HS2 to identify further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours and less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect Great Britain and its cities."
We've given SH2 the green light, because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also a connection - 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected through HS2 across Great Britain.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed track has the potential to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also provides the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain."
So we work enthusiastically with the British Government to explore the possibilities of bringing a high-speed rail to Scotland and thus to bring benefits to everyone and to complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British ministers, during the next year, and to joint decision-making on further steps.
She and Barta arrested inspections and anti-corruption police analysts.
Information about the arrest of Vita Bárta started to spread on Thursday night, when the message came from the server Prvnehpravy.cz.
MF TODAY soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS), her people were to arrest Bart in the centre of Prague.
It happened in front of the Four Seasons.
Inspections shall deal with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its competence shall also apply to civilian persons.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers arrested is the anti-corruption police - head of analyst and informationist Jan Petržílek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
But a spokesperson for the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav IbeheI, refused to comment on the fact that the media had to turn to GIBS on this matter.
Radka Sandorová, too, was not willing to say anything about the case, referred in turn to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said the spokesperson for the Zenklová prosecutor's office.
It can also be inferred from this vague reaction that the event took place, but it is under a stealth regime that does not allow a spokesperson to say anything specific.
In a similar situation is Bart's lawyer Oldřich Povera.
He told the media that he was representing Bart "even in this matter," but since it's classified information, he can't confirm or deny Bart's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former Police President Peter Lessy.
He was promoted to office by Bart along with former Chairman of the VV Radek John, who was at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The feud that burned up between former Prime Minister Petr Netime and the VV had even to be resolved by the then President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about things," said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but he was Barta at the time.
Bart was now running for election for the Dawn movement, and he missed the parliamentary mandate by just 175 votes.
The leader of the Dawn of Tomio Okamura has stated that he has no idea what this is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of many candidates for many parties on our candidate, and, as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Dawn of the Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bart space to run for the dawn because he helped him to solve the problem of executors.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smart phones during launch and landing, regardless of changes in the US, in order to mitigate the regulations on these facilities.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given American companies space to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the facilities remain in "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it has examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic equipment on aircraft," he said.
This question is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about extending the use of its wi-fi on-board entertainment system, has been inclined, but has announced that it will be subject to a decision by the regulatory authority.
"We would appreciate it if CASA carried out an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment) it would improve customers' experiences," said the spokesperson.
Qantas has announced that it will stick to the current regulations for now.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that soon," he said.
FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which may be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly study the FAA's decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from that of the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference with mobile phones, as well as revising manuals, training material, manual baggage programs and passenger information.
"Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones, at any altitude, 'said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew shall order passengers to switch off their equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment be safely stored under seats or in a storage space above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class pawnshops in Singapore are experiencing a boom
Janani Amirthalinga is stopping a gold bracelet, ring and earrings at the Bendemeer Shopping Center in Singapore to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money on it," says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, he says.
Indeed, demand across regions in Southeast Asia - where household debt increases - is that ValueMax, where a woman conducts her transaction, has become the third pawn on the Singapore market this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash - 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Stops in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income and can provide a loan faster than banks.
Therefore, with families feeling pressure because of rising life costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low and medium-income families turn to pawnshops to deal with a deteriorating financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted the increasing use of domestic credit, mainly due to increasing rents as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the 80% of GDP ratio, which is an increase compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumption debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The important thing is that with rising costs, people from middle to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist in the Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to people stalling their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewels for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops make up gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
In recent months, the largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops.
The growth in the pawnshop industry is so large that ValueMax, a branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four branches - but also outside Asia, says the CEO of ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million acquired on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors find themselves under fire of high-interest criticism, Ms. Jo says that collateral offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers stop objects that they already own, and monetizing personal property does not increase household debt," he says.
In the company, the asset pledge is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use pawnshops, there are not only people in financial distress.
The rich people of Singapore also use ValueMax branches when stopping gold bars or Rolex watches, so they can reach up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all kinds.
"These include rich individuals who need to borrow in the short term for their brave business or investment, or small businesses who need help to solve problems in their cash flow," says Mrs Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for dying health care in Tasmania contains harsh conditions to ensure that the government does not waste money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Australian Union is "speedy measures" to avert the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, higher chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with an independent Tasmanian MEP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the request of the patient.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract operations, will help eliminate indebtedness.
The money is also available to free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that the leading clinicians have told me would help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting regime and an accounting obligation.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Australian Union and inform on a monthly basis where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State supplies services as efficiently as possible.
Today, Mr Wilkie said that $325 million would be of no use "until real reform is followed in order to lay a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system."
Yet he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance, which it first raised in negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe that the Federal Auxiliary Package can free public health from the critical state," said Wilkie.
According to the government, these additional procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
A spokesman for the federal opposition in the health sector, Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just a "patch."
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our medical system," he said for ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian Union that spends 300 million dollars, and pretend that's good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted the amendment to Denise Diderota, which brings an exceptional film expedition and a representation of the times, but it is also more boring than it should be.
It takes place in the 1960s in France and tells a grim story about Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When he revolts, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally depraved mother introduced, and for another, he becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to lustful or sensational, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads to the audience experiencing torture similar to wearing a horsehair shirt.

Syria has destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions, said on Thursday the Committee on Global Monitoring for Chemical Weapons, while violent conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where toxic substances are expected to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that more than 120,000 inhabitants have been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organization's announcement came the day before November 1st,
the date set by that Haag-based organisation to destroy or prevent the operation of all chemical weapons and chemical mixing machinery equipment for the production of toxic gas and ammunition.
The completion, in principle, of this initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including yperite and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when the fighting in the city of Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of the chemical weapons factory and the storage site, was raging on Thursday, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, established in Britain.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of this, 61,067 civilians, including 6365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 Bashar al-Assad armed forces, 18,678 pro-government combatants, and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the killed are also 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN organisation estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting insurgents in Safira, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
On Thursday, the observer stated that the losses were on both sides but did not have specific figures.
The fighting has underlined the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission to get rid of the chemical arsenal in the middle of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW, which closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that its team is now "satisfied, that it verified - and watched the destruction - of Syria's declared essential equipment for production and blending / filling."
He added that "there are currently no other control activities planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said that they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two locations were "abandoned," according to Syria, and... the items of the chemical weapons program it contained were moved to two other declared locations that were checked. "
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I bow to the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organisation has ever had," said the director of the observers Ahmet Uzumcu in his commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawite sect, are facing each other in the civil war.
As regards further developments, the head of the Observatory Rami Abdul Rahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger of the judgment of the Bomber-Bomber of Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence of the last of the scholars who were brought to justice and said that Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were left dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other charges of terrorism, including a series of bombing attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, although she could insist that a man with the nickname "demolition man" be punished by his reputation as an explosive expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old Jane and Jenny twins in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other writers almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP, Mrs. Corteen said, "It should be put in front of a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with not seeing more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground when a strong charge was detonated shortly after 23: 00 on October 12, 2002, located in an outside parked van.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times the doctors "died."
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as three other members of the Jama Islamic terrorist cell responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others isn't that bad.
Patek was the last one to stand trial in Bali.
Arrested for almost ten years, but in January 2011, he was captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, US forces killed the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish a link between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt regret for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and to which will include the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can still appeal to the judgment.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological achievements on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from gate to gate" - apart from calling from their mobile phones - to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the impatiently expected new rules issued by the FAA on Thursday.
Passengers are not supposed to expect changes to happen immediately.
As quickly as the change will be introduced, according to the airlines, the FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate to the FAA administration how their aeroplanes comply with the new rules and have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment storage directives in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the extended use of electronic equipment very quickly," said the FAA in its statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives us a warrant.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft is falling to land and not to turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are correctly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and taxiing, referred to the FAA.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adapted to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Steward Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented - and we will work closely with transport companies - this will be a success," said Glading in her statement.
To be honest, we're tired of looking like "guards."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers of altitude, said the Agency.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online Scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, fired from American Airlines' aircraft because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored for fear that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using cell phones are not defined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the prohibition for certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transport Security Committee, an expert on national transport security at CBS News, said that cell phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Cell phones are indeed a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference with the towers in the air," said Rosenker.
Last month, the FAA Advisory Committee proposed that the government allow the wider use of electronic equipment to be used by the government to investigate this problem.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to mitigate the restrictions on their use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim there is no valid security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to interference of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radios, technical achievements at the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also designed, and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered to passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes.
The plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted under the new rules for the greater use of electronic equipment, said Huert.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio transmission than previous generations.
For example, e-readers only issue minimal broadcasts when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those who press to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the transport aircraft with their electronic Kindle readers and conducted the test flight, but no problem appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these establishments pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said that he is convinced that the interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only sketchy reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment may cause interference with air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off their equipment during low visibility instrument flying.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes, and according to it, this is a reasonable procedure for travelling to the public, which uses technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into the wild.
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One of the rattlesnakes was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being previously treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue center until he recovered.
Colin Seddon's operating centers said, "This rattlesnake probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught him above the North Sea."
Apparently, he ran out of power and found refuge on an oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added, "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help."
By the time the rattlesnake was released, he was in good condition and well.
Is the European elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to combine businesses and define what changes in relations with the EU the British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we have asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British businesses of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government favors new trade ties with countries like China, India, and Brazil, rather than getting caught up in a long and strenuous process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulations to product laws - most entrepreneurs took the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels's regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area - even 40% of large enterprises, that is, traditionally the most pro-European society, expressed their consent.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings identified by companies of different sizes and main business groups show that the business sector is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will transfer the influence back to Britain.
There is much at stake - reaching a change in the treaty and a better agreement for Britain can make a profit of up to 16% when voting in a referendum for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and, given the way the eurozone is on the road to a closer economic and fiscal union, it is becoming increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and, as the results of our survey show, for business, this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels's regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted that spying went too far!
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, according to AFP, the head of American diplomacy John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the Minister, intelligence was used to avert terrorist attacks.
"First confession from Washington," according to the AFP, was heard in the midst of a violent controversy on both sides of the Atlantic because of the scandalous discovery of mass surveillance by the American National Security Agency (NSA), the target of which was also the American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you that this will not happen in the future," said Kerry.
In the interview, however, he advocated the practice so far.
According to him, gathering information is essential for combating terrorism and preventing assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people were killed because we were able to be informed of the plot in time," stressed Kerry.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "went too far in some cases."
The American intelligence affair, which allegedly watched hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turns out that the Americans also tracked the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The launch of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said Gazprom President Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire continent of Europe.
South Stream should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, is said by officials.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "permanently" eliminated.
As soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that construction in other countries should start at the end of this year in the direction of the flow.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They'll have a decisive battle ahead of them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to the ever-clarifying reports of Israel in Wednesday's air strikes to two places in Western Syria, it destroyed the missiles intended for Hezbollah.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its programme is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere with the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it will prevent the arms from being moved to Hezbollah's hands in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday's Israeli attacks on weapons storage in Western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, the missiles fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian missile base of the Snúbar Jabla south of Latáki.
Al-Arabiya News Station claims that two warehouses were hit in which missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to her sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron Ben Yishaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of Hezbollah's armed section to handle missiles.
The SA-8 are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has had since the '80s.
They are located on a moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.
They're equipped with radar, but they shut down after the missile is fired, so it's hard to get a lock on them.
Latákaja lies in Western Syria, in an area inhabited by ruling alavits.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in Western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shia community that the alavits belong to.
Now, apparently, 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help take back the army, Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country of Homs.
According to al-Arabi's sources, the battle is to be retaliated for the recent opposition attack on Syrian Shia Brigade headquarters, Abbas Fada, in Shi'a part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many insurgents from Kusayr have just left for Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted premature elections.
Corruption, spending money on overpriced purchases and public procurement, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals have been mentioned as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that most citizens were satisfied with this situation.
That they actually didn't mind and that they were actually satisfied with the situation that was there (stealing and debiting this state).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not show up for elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted for ODS in total, thus, 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all legal voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1 016 829 CSRS voters to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (since all these parties were involved in the "theft" and indebtedness of the state), 64,23% of the legal voters actually agreed to this situation.
In fact, most voters have made it clear that they are not to punish the culprits by stealing and overindebting this state.
Or do you think that the members of the CSPD who participated in this will enforce the relevant laws?
Is there any way we can help?

The Royal Commission has learned that two members of staff of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) have been indicted before the actions against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned that before the allegations were made against child-bearing educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of child sexual abuse.
But it was said before the committee that in its opening statement to the committee, this association stated that they had never dealt with a case of child sexual abuse in their organization.
The CEO of Phillip Hare was asked about a case where one of the employees of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another, when the gym teacher at Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of children in his custody.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the committee's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
It admitted that the opening statement by YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which appreciated this organisation as a leading advocate of children's rights.
The evidence presented by the Commission indicates that YMCA has been alerted to receiving the second lowest of the four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society of August this year.
Mr Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership itself failed to accept Mr Lord without knowing whether the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys he committed during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr Hare rejected the claim that YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting child safety breaches by Mr Lord.
The staff members submitted evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including the Lord being alone with the children, privately guarding them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and applied for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of the YMCA services in Caringbah, which was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to."
The CEO said he didn't accept the evidence of the staff, that they felt uncomfortable if they had to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and that's why they didn't report the problem.
Mr Hare said that he told the board of YMCA in New South Wales that the lesson of the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organisation was that the staff "did not report," and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were filed was made by the General Manager for Services to Children at YMCA by Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid any disruption of evidence, but it was "overzealous" and ill-executed.
An expert on child sexual abuse, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that was safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, processing, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned on December 20th.
Tony Blair said he'd take the chance to go back to being Prime Minister, but he admitted that coming back was unlikely.
In a late-night interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, a 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned after ten years of leadership, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an envoy for the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response to London's Evening Standard was as follows: "Yes, of course, but it's probably not going to happen, is it, so..."
While a crowd of horse-show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for Horse of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for Fenton Kirkland's three-year-old.
Although he still doesn't go to school and only a few months ago he took the first steps, this little boy and his pet, Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly slipped through three laps to eventually win the main prize and leave behind 30 growing adult opponents.
This inseparable pair - with the same height - was praised for the appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry village near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret into a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee for his third birthday in March, and he's been practicing with this Shetland pony every day ever since.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee work well together."
They didn't get their hopes up, but in the end, they left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and total strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantiglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and applauding."
He ran along the sand all the way across the arena, and although he was so tiny, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and the farm and he got two chickens.
Given how he started, he'll be back at Horse of the Year again soon, and I'm sure he'll do fine.
The spokesman for the annual horse show-off contest said, "The Fenton are only three, but he already knows how to control a pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they showed up at the competition circuit.
They always see how good the team's work is between the pony and the one leading it - and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton could use some cute clothes, really fit in with him.
Too much inquisitive newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which requested the release of a reporter accused of slander on the front page, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
New Express, based in Guangzhou, has made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhau.
However, Mr Chen later admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a partially state-owned company.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper will now do "full repair."
The regulation on "rectification" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that, between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng Evening News issued several false reports on Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," said the administrator in his statement.
He said he had to decide to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yonghou in the form of a cancellation of a press license."
In addition, he "ordered the Yangcheng Group of Evening News to make a complete correction to the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express concerning financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper issued two applications for his release on the front page and claimed to be behind his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen showed up on state television and confessed to giving false stories in return.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion, as well as to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he said at CCTV State News Station.
I did it mostly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I acted badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued an apology on the front page, stating that he had failed to check his reports properly.
Recently, a few closely monitored suspects have made a confession on television.
Experts say that confessions are still being enforced regularly, regardless of the amendment to this year's law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A drug smuggling tunnel has been found between the US and Mexico with its own railroad.
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico was discovered, accompanied by its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail.
The American authorities described a tunnel about one meter by one as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which is zigzag to the length of almost six football fields, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be delivered undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of a conviction, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are penetrating large drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which in front of drug cartels poses a problem as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres long equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and the Centre connect management.
They offer, for example, joint advertising
The new integrated Newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken the next step to transform the Centre's holding company into its media house.
From Friday, Economia and the Centre have shared top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and personnel union are essential for the integration of the two publishers into the joint media house," commented on the changes made by the Vice-President of the Economics Board and appointed Director-General Kamil Čermák.
Cermak, who will lead the single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopářil was appointed the new joint director of the business, to whom the advertising director of the two companies Zuzana Tylčerová was appointed.
Stephen Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of editors is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team includes the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts has been entrusted with the newly established function of Director of Marketing.
A separate corporate communication unit is newly managed by Vera Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Pázud, the management of human resources for both publishers is led by Petr Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will enable us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the content of all the published titles and, last but not least, to make business management more efficient," added Chermák.
The company Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract to buy the company Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Updatálne.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najusto or portfolio of other nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of the Economic Newspapers, the news server IHNED.cz, the Weekly News of Respect and Economist and the quantity of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers it is the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles in the long term.
This June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Prague, Karlín.
CME will target the television business.
They'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The media group CME will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants a thousand people thinner.
He's going to chop off all the secondary activities, and he just wants to focus on his main business, the TV show.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CET 21 is part of CME, which holds licences for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fan, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of MTV music station.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for the domestic TV TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really can't comment," said Novy Josef Koukoleček.
According to the information provided by MF DNOES, significant redundancies in the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should be on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both the new bosses of Novy Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined long-term director Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a Wednesday conference call with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own programmes, film and production activities.
The cooling tower burned at night in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague there was a large capacity storage tank, according to the firefighters probably a cooling tower.
"Firemen went to the fire on Thursday before 11: 00 p.m., they were still setting the fire this morning," Pavlina Adamcová, a spokesperson for Prague firefighters, announced.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the surrounding area according to measurements did not exceed the permitted limits.
The damage and the cause of the fire are unknown.
Around five dozen firefighters have gradually arrived in Kolbenov Street.
"This is a fire of a large capacity storage tank, probably cooling towers," said Adam.
"There is no functional hydrant network on the premises, so we are extinguishing by means of transport lines from tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing complicated the poorly functioning network of hydrants, so the firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire department commander has issued a second-degree fire alarm.
There are four levels, four are declared in the most serious situations.
Chemists have also set out to verify the level of hazardous substances that could have gotten into the air during the fire.
"However, they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that exceeded the hygiene standards," said the firefighters' spokesperson.
The British police have delivered an extradition notice to Assange.
British police have delivered today a release notice to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard has declared that he has delivered a "extradition notice" to a 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to the police station and that if he does not, he may be under arrest.
Assange, under the British law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court cancelled his appeal against extradition this month, thus facing extradition to Sweden for charges of sexual crimes.
As he feared that Stockholm would release him to the US, he sought refuge on June 19 at the Ecuador Embassy in London, where he applied for asylum to this South American country.
Scotland Yard "delivered an extradition notice to a 40-year-old man asking him to come to the police station on the day and hour he was assigned," said the spokesman.
Assange continues to violate the terms of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he can face charges of espionage because he published 250,000 American diplomatic papers on WikiLeaks' website.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km / h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km / h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester Howie Police Court, he confessed to the charge of driving unscrupulously and uncarefully.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month restraining order.
Howie was also ordered to pay the cost of £90 and a premium for the defendant of £100.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble is cracking
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally quantified the tax on the proceeds of financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision by Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, presented a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings worth more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds of the property transfer fee in the housing fund in the counties Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which in the 2012 / 13 tax year amounted to £708 million, already exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "In view of the increase in the transfer of real estate at high value homes and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are undertaxed regardless of the effect of an outdated system of head tax."
He added that "this move could have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London, or that existing owners were reluctant to sell."
Front properties - top 5% to 10% of the housing market, according to the price - in a rich belt ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded an increase of 11.8% last year.
Central London prices continue to show a steady growth rate of 5.6% from year to year, but they were overshadowed by a flourishing "domestic market," which, according to Savils' real estate agency survey, experienced a southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) increase.
Scientists have explained more how tail movements are related to dog mood
Early research has shown that joyous dogs wiggle their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can record these subtle differences in tail movement and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist from the University of Trent, said, "It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have a different connection to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions."
That's what we've been trying to observe in other species.
He added that, as in humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotion.
In order to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionately wagging tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and another time to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown dog films about dogs - whether in the natural version or in the form of silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also managed to adjust tail movement and to show it more to the right or to the left."
When the animals saw an otherwise bland dog move its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wiggling its tail), they remained completely calm.
But when she recorded tail filming mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wiggling with the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think that dogs knowingly communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, it believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and which they do not have to watch out for.
He said, "If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tails in one direction is repeatedly associated with friendly behavior and movement of traffic produces less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience."
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, vets, and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
An expert on dog behavior John Bradshaw, a university veterinarian at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads on the left when they're watching an aggressive dog, and on the right when they're looking at a happy dog.
And in another technical treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said, "With a dog robot, dogs were more likely to get to know dogs when they were wiggling their tail to the left than to the right, when they were becoming uncertain - quite the opposite of an Italian study."
According to him, the difference can be given by the fact that dogs in these different studies did not interpret animals in films or dog robots completely as dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs respond to real dogs might help.
"Although in the case of many different mammals there are strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and another time to the other.
Arctic Monkeys moved the concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness.
The Arctic Monkeys rock group moved the concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
But Alex Turner's lead singer's illness forced her to move the show.
The group's announcement came after being similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In the statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: "After the decision to postpone today's performance at the LG arena in Birmingham and on the basis of medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys Group must postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and will unfortunately not be able to perform."
The performance in the LG arena in Birmingham will thus take place on 20 November and the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets to these performances remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to everyone who bought tickets for the inconvenience it caused them.
If you need more information, please contact the customer service at the ticket counter where you bought your tickets.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope František was the first to appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope, and they are the ones who vote for the Pope, so František will establish his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of the Pope - the group is thus shrinking to 120 elected cardinals.
In a statement announcing this message, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson for the Vatican, said that before the ceremonial promotion of the new cardinals, there will be a gathering of the current cardinals known as the Consistorium.
"Pope František decided to announce his decision to call the February Consistorium in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings requiring the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that the number of voting cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He said that the Pope usually names as many cardinals as it takes to raise the number of voters back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The Consistorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after František was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain focus on Europe for Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František appointed the Cardinals' Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope made all his own decisions.
"Now František chose these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it was "quite possible," that these cardinals the Pope would ask for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is absolutely new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted bishops from big places to cardinals, but František is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he's naming."
GM is downloading some new light trucks in the USA to repair seat-backs
According to Friday's announcement from the US Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading almost 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to correct the defect with manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may have a fault.
Consequently, seat-backs do not comply with the federal safety standards for head restraints.
The notification placed on the NHTSA website says that "if the car is hit from behind, the passenger's head restraint may not protect the passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury."
The downloaded models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
GM launched its delivery in June, and for this leading American car company, it is the most important marketing of the vehicle from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery holder of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the notices to owners due to the 16-day failure of the government, which weakened car sales growth in October.
The sales of supplies of Silverado and Sierra, which were reworked for the 2014 models, increased to around 20% during the first 10 months of this year, was declared by GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to USD 37.47.

I thought this book would cheer me up during the gloomy days of my second year at medical school and restore a little hope in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win," and these are memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The elections ended with overwhelming superiority, and television coverage forced us to contemplate the historic value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept the newspaper they got.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for a change.
In 2008, Obama had 82 percent of his support.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic days - they seem distant memories, sad reminders of missed opportunities.
Indeed, in the years after I threw my first ballot, there were changes.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes - from the law on affordable care through the redeployment of our troops from Iraq and the end of politics "ask no questions, say nothing" after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, the public's choice of health care and the closure of the base in Guantánamo.
But after many situations in which I defended the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the consent to eavesdropping on foreign leaders, nor the drone raids that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it persecutes those who reveal the misconduct of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process, or for reducing public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And, more recently, they cannot excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on the accessible care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like this could be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government might be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Clearly, the election is not a predictable process, and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and uncut alternative, and he seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we once heard of.
Yet the return to 2008 - with Obama's support falling below 45% this week - is increasingly difficult through this book.
They make me remember the series of promises that disappeared.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton at the primary in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back on track and remain loyal to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are exclusively the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave program.
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave program, because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining mogul, who is waging a dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax bill, made this claim when he tried to remove the question of whether he was in conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate to play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
"He was in a great conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave, because if either of his daughters were to become pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would be given parental leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election of the Election Commission, after recalculating the votes, she officially declared Mr Palmer a winner in the battle for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast thanks to a gain of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the election rooms are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately, and have the results at 6: 30 p.m.?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, results can be erased if someone doesn't like them?
These days and these days, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Election Commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new work "very seriously."
The public office is a public service.
"We do not seek any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing hands will change your mind.
98 people, divided into three groups, participated in the experiment.
The first two were tasked with solving an impossible task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed its hands after failure seemed a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
The "wash hands" group also did better in the next test than the other.
Yet those who washed their hands achieved worse results in further tests than those who did not wash them.
The results of the "washed 'were at the level of a third group, the participants of which did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the test results show that body cleanliness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, and the testing needs to focus much more in the next test.
If we transferred the research results to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic when we got back from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but it is a fifth of the way through the city transport.
The hygiene is usually also clinging to the garden or workshop after work, where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
A pet caress motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks as to how much it is necessary to wash your hands after giving a hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," commented the results of the survey by the skin doctor Claudia Komarkova.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) will suspend two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that global investigations by control authorities concerning suspicious currency market machinations are becoming increasingly frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities in investigations into the largest financial market in the world, where they change the owners of USD 5.3 trillion each day.
The two traders mentioned would be the first employees of RBS suspended in the framework of an expanding investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR manipulation scandal (London interbank interest rate).
The bank refused to comment on the suspension but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our ongoing search continues on this matter and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people who were close to this event said that RBS had sent the UK financial behaviour authority records of e-mails and quick messages sent from and to the accounts of a former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European President of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European President of Cash Trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former currency manager in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any misdemeanor.
The bankers from Barclays and Citigroup were part of Mr Usher's rapid-message group, and the people inaugurated to this event said.
UBS stated this week that, after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that it had investigated suspicious foreign currency machinations in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against one of its employees.
Worldwide, at least six offices - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office - are investigating the claim that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combing through years of fast news and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that was one of the largest engines for making profits in investment banks' closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that it is essentially impossible to manipulate a large and highly liquid foreign currency market, but high-ranking traders say that this is not necessarily true.
A high-ranking businessman said that, despite the considerable volume of daily foreign currency trading, the dismemberment of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released a trader from its share trading department this week, which caused a loss of almost USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have registered over a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the survey in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This follows from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 were still infected throughout the Czech Republic.
In 396, immune failure disease has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of people infected in the Czech Republic has increased every year over the last decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed an infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009 the examination revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010 180.
Last year, the number fell to 153, but last year it was record-breaking.
According to the lab, there were 212 of them.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases exceeds 200 this year, I think there is no doubt," means an expert on AIDS, Miroslav Hlavatý, who has led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, the tests revealed a disease in 39 people and last year at 47, said Hlavý.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September HIV tests confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS disease occurred in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
If you really want to get to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through a fancy center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal.
Many people "read from graves."
They slowly roam the cemeteries and gain intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs, how big and cohesive families belong to, what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they'll find out how the survivors care about their dead.
The Supreme Court has supported Obama's Health Care Act.
The US Supreme Court has ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
With a vote of 5: 4, the court has ruled that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care - which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they are in danger of paying a fine - does not contradict the Constitution on the basis of government tax jurisdiction.
President John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal court members, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the 2700-page Act and held that the legal requirement for health care, which requires States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, would otherwise threaten to lose all funding for sickness insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have brought an action to block this law.
During the 2012 primary, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the presumed proposed candidate, Mitt Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a lame ass" no longer threatens to jail, the court annulled the law
Until now, Zimbabwe has had to be careful how it talks in public about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been at its head since the end of 1987.
According to Section 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 to one year in prison was threatened for dishonour of the presidency.
"Public prosecutors should not be eager to accuse people who comment on the President in pubs or other public places," stated the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, inform the British BBC.
There were a number of damaged Zimbabwe against the law, among them Tendai Danga, who was arrested by the police two years ago for alleged insult to the President in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, in prison, an opposition activist in public ended up calling Mugabe a "lame ass."
In August, the prosecutor then accused a 26-year-old man of using a poster of Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared it an anti-constitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The State cannot punish people whose statements later prove false," said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe's law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing someone to criminalise for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," added Malal.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country hard for more than 33 years, in March Zimbabwe, on the basis of a referendum, adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties.
A small step away from the dictatorship of one man of the country took place in 2009, when the agreement between Mugab and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj to the prime minister's seat.
Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and, until 2008, the world's highest inflation rate, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe, only the currencies of other countries are paid.
The impoverished economy is on the verge of Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers to his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience of farming.
Central banks keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument to enable banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks said so in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the chief international economist of the London Bank of Barclays.
"So far, all transitional tools of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not surprising to me," adds Vojtěch Benda, the chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began to emerge in 2007 when the international credit market first stalled.
The central bank agreements allowed access to the euro, dollars and other currencies for whoever needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its program to support the US economy, which could drive the price of money even higher in the global market.
The swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortages of one currency in the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) erases personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn't finish that because there was someone at the branch who couldn't complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, registration failed, then I moved, and that changed my address and ID number.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn't, because I had another number of the OP, an address, and that I just couldn't finish it, and that I had to ask for a deletion of the data and make a new registration.
That is what I did and I wrote on technical support on 24.10.2013 that I am asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
On that day, technical support wrote to me that I had to finish my registration at the branch.
This started with a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where they finally wrote after the 4th of July 25 that they deleted personal data at my request.
So you would think that you could make the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it has not been deleted - it is not a personal figure, but in the end they also disabled this).
So I used another username and it came out to me that my personal data had already been stored in order to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that claims to have been deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
On my question, how can it be written back to me that personal data has actually been deleted on the 25th of the 10th and that I send an e-mail with the error?
I did this (yesterday around 15: 00) and they wrote back to me today that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that I cannot because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been contacting technical support for a week now and I am dealing with it that it is still not possible?
And what if it were true what they claim (as it is not) could not be registered by anyone with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way in the 13.22, I actually registered in the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number, and the world was wondering, I got a page that sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you can't register in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties the registration to an e-mail and phone number and didn't just disable the data as he claims.
So once again, I have told this technical support that they simply lie (either intentionally or they do not know what they write) because what they write is not true.
I've shown several screenings that the registration problem was before 31.10, so the "fake" registration simply doesn't affect this.
Tipsport wrote me back a little bit - I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your claims.
And he shut down communication.
The same sentence is repeated over and over again that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and so it did not actually happen.
So, to sum up, Tipsport not only did he not erase the data as he claims, but he's lying when he says otherwise.
Worse, it's easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like a mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things were set in motion and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was passed on for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and alerting to the same mistake).
There's music in the subway on the Bridge
The transport company hl. m. (DPP) of Prague launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during metro operation, is Bridge Line A on the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Textor Michal Horáček brought not only his brand new double CD Czech calendar to the Hall of Cologne, but especially on the show between us singers Lenka Nová, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by excellent Orchestra Matìj Benko.
After the intro and the performance about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how they played last in Cologne and the theatre and the entire city of the electric current fell out.
"Otherwise they produced two types of cards in Cologne, with which I had a lot of contact," he remembered.
He also reminded President Zeman of his native.
"Maybe we could do a tour of the Fosters or the Dúbravák at Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical achievement.
The calendar was also made by Josef Manes, who put it on the clock, about ice hockey but at the time he had no idea how we met on the squares and chanted who did not jump is not Czech.
That's the name of one of the Czech calendars, but we're not going to play it here today, "he amused.
Ondra Ruml said he sang a very good song for him in the daytime, singing at night, and accompanied him to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keys, cello, guitar and bass.
All three vocalists together sang a little bit of a detour into the side of the heart sitting, which immediately started the auditorium.
"I'm glad you're interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in the town of Kmoch," said Michal Horáček.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I recognize František Segrad, in the original of Richard Müller, rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Heger was reminded of the song Dad liked Lída Baar with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West.
Michael Kocáb's composer was reminded by Sebastian, and Segrado sang a wonderful song in Prague with a music by Jarda Svoboda, a sad native and a former Cologne.
But that was the conclusion, a standing ovation and an addition in the form of an optimistic composition. We live in a wonderful time.
One more addition was prepared on the playlist, but the fans were no longer applauding it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's book and even the cover from the legendary LP and with any interested people took a picture.
Berdycha and Štěpeček will complete Rosol and Hájek
At the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia was nominated by the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navre to four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives are defending the trophy, but they are going to play the opponent's field in Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15 to 17.
The Czechs are in the finals for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to hot ground, it's going to be wild, and as always, we need to focus on our performance."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stephen, the architect of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria is supposed to look like.
Without any unnecessary hype, threats, and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target, and they came back.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire operation, and they no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of confused and big-headed, unsupported acts of Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be fooled by the media's claims that a "Syrian base" or "supply to Hezbollah" has been bombed.
I recently wrote about the fact that while US aid to secular insurgents in the country remains on rhetorical level, Russia continues to supply Syria with weapons.
And it was the fresh shipment of Russian missiles unloaded at the port of Latákiya that became the target of an Israeli raid.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel has again bombed the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although it should be the other way around according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has won two members of the troop, probably Delta Force.
He had no idea until now that they had decorated themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
It is known the heroic death of two former SEALs, who defended the CIA area in the city, in my opinion, were members of a CIA secret task force that was made up of former soldiers.
There's been a long speculation as to what SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at a CIA residence elsewhere.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (on one of these two SEALs died after a mortar strike) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two still unknown heroes.
They were part of an American task force in Tripoli, and as soon as they got word of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene, and together with five private contractors, they shot their way into the CIA complex in Benghazi.
Obama's administration is baffled by the fact that during the attack, the task force was not deployed officially and the whole, and that it simply hesitated to do so.
The commander of the commandos is likely to release these volunteers without orders.
Anyway, the fact that in the country, not on a one-time basis, but on a permanent basis, American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And that is because, until recently, nothing like this has officially been admitted, and even now, it's just a sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the US, while half-trying to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although it would take a lot more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of a secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised Iran's air force for prosecuting US drones.
But little is known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
However, if Iran's drone is discovered in an international area, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in an international space above sea level, when perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew over Phantom to check his weaponry optically, without being registered by Phantom on radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly showed up to him and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without murmuring.
It's no wonder Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but he remembers the Vietnam war.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen still can win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has been failing mainly in results lately, the defenseman or defenseman Victoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has taken the form that brought him back to the representation after a year.
He also succeeds in shooting, exerting activity, a penalty kick was ordered in the Teplice game after the intervention.
Victoria reached out to Slavia in the last two rounds and Teplice after the victory, but in the end, she took one point out of these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in the match with Jablonco.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," says František Rajtoral.
The team is preparing carefully for a tough match with the Norochokes, who play offensive football.
Everything is moving towards a match with Jablonc, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," attracts the Czech fan representative to the Doosan Arena stands.
Piles did not come out as they wished, but Victoria rejects the word of crisis.
That's how football works, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes you're worse.
But there's no way I'd talk about a crisis.
"I believe we will win on Friday, and it will be good again," Westeros' defenseman means.
Victoria will once again rely on support from fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them by winning," adds Rajtoral.
Jana Petova: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but now that I think about it, it's not really a step at all, it's a big jump - a leap a few years back, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come from school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "duties" were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running out of school, throwing the bag in the corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump shot.
Then during the Helena and her boys series, embroidered with a chain stitch a ceremonial tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings wash the dishes at last, vacuum them, in the winter put wood into the tiled stove and do tasks after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of the task of writing love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning to eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, whose contents were not even lying next to strawberries) and to drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mom and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical nights when the grave silence was in my room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the tape radio that were shooting loudly in my mom's old tape recorder.
And then on the pencil, we'd rewind the tapes and play the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and we'd drink a siphon to that.
Or we made a phone call over the table using cans that were tied together by a string - and while we were making the call to hear better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the guard was a match + wadding.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents managed to live off of it in a way that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cell phones or laptops or designer clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "flange" to the wardrobe was a bottled home-made T-shirt using SAVA.
We were satisfied with the electronics of our mother's cassette-cassette-cassette, and the maximum Walkman, which we shared with our sister, which, by the way, we only used on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be mad, or as I said, go "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure my parents were saving up for a long time, but unfortunately, it hasn't been warm for a long time.
My little sister put a strudel in him, said he was eating the tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if she was sleeping a strudel.
Unfortunately, he was asleep, but it was his last bite.
Well, he still has this story, poor man, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put the strudel in the video and thought it would play the recipe and not play it, which is why she still can't cook it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate, communicate without a phone, a computer.
My sister and I had an appointment with my grandmother's granddaughter on holidays, when we'll meet again next summer at grandma's - and that was it, that was it.
We met.
Promise someone to see you next year?
I also remember the winter when me and the whole village ran outside, building snowmen, riding a snow-covered hill by the church on a bag of hay.
Then my whole family and I had dinner and talked about the day before.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear that notoriously famous sentence before every dinner, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but you certainly don't have soap in the lemon net tied to the bathroom faucet.
After dinner, when my dad "worked" in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, put our feet on the tile stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackling of the wood that came out of the linulo stove.
We were closer - really - not counting how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through various cabins, texts.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially when I add these memories by looking at albums where they are neatly glued with black corners produced by black and white photos.
And in case I didn't know how old I was back then, the photo is always written from behind for a year of taking a picture.
I look at the fact that, although we didn't look very good in the pot, and we had our cousin's pants two times bigger, no one had ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better get back to reality.
Until 2013, and I'll be waiting to see what modern times will come up with, like, once for my kids.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for a young teenage generation, so at least somewhere "a hundred years behind monkeys," and I think they're missing out a lot, too, that they're not going to experience this "over-finish" time.
I wish them well!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
On Thursday, a group that owns thousands of patents to the extinct Nortel company filed a patent infringement suit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that it overlapped during the auction in the context of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement at the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with violating seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps connect internet-searched expressions with the appropriate advertising, a lawsuit, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar companies were not available immediately.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on Google Android's operating system, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial price offer of USD 900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to USD 4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the battle for patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for USD 12.5 billion, a trade motivated partly by a group of Motorola patents.
"Despite the failure to win the patents that are the subject of the dispute in the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," stated in the application.
Rockstar seeks increased damages from Google because it considers that there is a violation of Google's patent on purpose, as the prosecution claims.
Miloslav Ceipkova: November smile
She came from the outside, four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
First, she put down her smile, the one that kept showing off as a defense from the so-called friendly surroundings.
She was relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put down in public.
He was only honest at home on the days when she was grandma and she had Elinka or Adík's grandchildren around her.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless courses in business skills.
Now they've finally come in handy.
So she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a costume on a masquerade.
November, not another month can do the miracle to make her smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn't been here in almost three years.
Egypt places the first freely elected president in office
Muhammad Morsi took an inaugural oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Morsi promised "the new Egypt" when he was ceremoniously placed in office as the first free-elected president of this country, following Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months earlier.
Morsi also became the first free-elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago when he was put in office before the Supreme Constitutional Court.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black robes in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Morsi at the ceremony broadcast live on national television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer studied in the US and a Muslim Brotherhood member, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of the violent attacks of individual governments for most 84 years since its inception as an illegal organisation.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11 o'clock local time in a small motorcade, hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak's presidential ostentatious period, transport was only briefly halted so that the motorcade could travel through a usually busy route connecting the city centre to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, ridiculously referred to as the charismatic "reserve tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also all those who want to lead to the end of the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to judges in a wood-lined chamber where he took an oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University to give an inaugural speech.
While standing by, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting "army and people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970s became the bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian government was born last year, and solemnly promised to take back the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them from the expelled leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath in court, rather than in Parliament, as is customary, he has submitted to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll probably be police specialists in the ghetto to ease the tension.
Police specialists should be active in the ghetto in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
In his view, it would help to improve the situation in the country in particular "fast-track social housing."
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, especially the Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
It was flattering.
According to the experts of the problem sites, it has increased by a hundred in the meantime.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are escalating.
There were anti-Roma marches in several places.
The extremists were joined by the people around them.
According to the interior, it is difficult for police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.
It is said that "a consistent application of equal access in law enforcement is a fundamental condition."
But it is said that this cannot be achieved without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
"Thanks to established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a wide range of infringements," said the interior.
Ghetto specialists would receive extra fees, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be paid for by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (now around CZK 15,5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 per cent of the sum, 85 per cent of the funds.
The preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being drawn up.
The project is due to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements," said the authors of the news.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis to determine where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release after the project is completed every year.
According to the design of the project, the selected officers will attend an internship in Slovakia first.
Five dozen members should go through this training every year.
These will be the most suitable candidates.
Special education should also be created for the officers who will be working in the ghetto.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
They say it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet the hostel with precise rules such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social apartments that are comparable to ordinary housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan to be drawn up by social workers.
They would have to follow the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send children to school, retrain and actively look for a job.
If they tried to integrate, they would have advanced to a higher standard of housing.
The system of permeable housing should work for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation of "in a pro-integration-motivated environment."
The social housing model is being prepared by local development and work departments.
They'll have it by the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: Carbon Hill - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Carbon Hill is a conspicuous hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Together with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were still here at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a larger distance, there is at the top of the Carbon Hill a conspicuous white painted baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary of Pomovic, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church did not behave.
Shortly after the church was completed, the alley was set up from four rows of Lip, about 1 km long.
The cross road on the Carbon Hill is already the third version, the original one stood there after 1916, the second one, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by the local artist František Nedomlel.
He used different species of wood from the Low Jeseník region.
Similarly, the rock pedestals from the area form an interesting geological exposition.
Every stop includes the name of the sponsor.
The carbon top is the rest of the young volcano.
Although data from radiometric measurements of age differ somewhat, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Ordný (3,3 million years old) and older than the Venus volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
In it, it cast out a significant amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the subsoil, which by firing gained red-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption was cast by red, brown red and sometimes black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tufts are conspicuous volcanic bombs up to 1 meter large. Even the second eruption ended with lava discharge.
At the end of the activity of the volcano, lava flowed out, which today forms up to 50 m thick layer of slag basalt.
Volcanoes in which the discharge of volcanic ash with lava discharge is alternated are the most common types of volcanoes.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name stratovlikan.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
But he was threatened by mining rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intense mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tuffs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public, thereby preserving this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and small cohesion of rock, which are rapidly ripening, falling apart and sliding down the slope.
The quarry is disappearing quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.
You can get to the Carbon Hill after the green tourist sign from Bruntal, or from Silesian Kočov.
Automobilists can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the lime alley, where even a short educational path begins.
She moved from the villa to the building.
Ivana grew up and spent the greater part of her life in a villa with a garden and pool in one of Prague's most beautiful residential areas on Ořekhovka.
But the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance package.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for a replacement home for herself and her old mother.
From her friends she received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the vast forest park and dam excited me to the other side," remembers Ivan's first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a provisional for, like, three years.
"Today we have lived here for more than 13 years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change," adds the owner.
The mother and daughter then moved from a 100-foot apartment to a smaller apartment with a surface area of 62 m2 and gave almost all the equipment away.
The action was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as door painting or window change.
The previous owner crashed the core, but the owner was most affected by the impractical and unnecessarily large hall, and by the small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used the drywall room to define the individual zones and structure, which allowed the new location of the lights.
The first intervention she committed after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout to 2 + kk, but the room was acquired in the air room and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to the partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana couldn't handle the bathroom.
For years, I've been taking home magazines and looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So on recommendation, I reached out to young architect Kamila Douděrova.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivan.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom it was possible to adjust the hall available at the same time.
The architect joined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced two doors with open wings with one sliding one, thus saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently wheelchair-free.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, in addition, there is a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower next to the closet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douderová continued.
As part of the "How to build a dream," a quick but fundamental change of living room took place, which was also attended by architect Martin Čenek.
We had to get three functions, a dining room, a living room and a sleeping room into the space that was created by connecting two smaller rooms without helping each other with the classical principles of optical division, for example, half-rungs or Japanese walls.
"This would in the end violate the openness and uniformity of space," explains the architect.
The original separation of the sleeping and living area was possible.
All you had to do was turn your back on two sofas and put a custom-made duvet box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the paintings.
On the kitchen floor and dining area, the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived with wallpaper with pattern.
If necessary, the kitchenette covers sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor from the antiallergic marmole has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate: softer non-slippery surface without spatula and better sound insulation.
The system of niche and plasterboard ceilings highlighted in colour is an example of how space can be used in the building.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it would be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivan.
Graphoglass with flowering magnolia motif is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
The small apartment managed to store the books, among other things, in the space under the window parapets.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably operated remotely.
The new contrast with the elderly works perfectly in the renovated interior, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier and with quality art items that Ivan collects all his life.
The last one came in the kitchen.
The lockers were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect has reduced their number and rearranged their deployment.
Furniture in simple design is custom made, white surface softens slightly pearly surface.
The small space was fitted with an imaginative solution of washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the whole glass wall cladding above the working plate.
Unique graphoglass with digitally printed motif is attractive, plus it is well maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood where she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cladding.
The big shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from a given environment in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
The interior has been reunited in material and color and has been tried for its elegant, cosy, not too crowded appearance.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of objects daily needs," says Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has ruled: Time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Netime can be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed prior to the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
It was only protected by a procedural immunity that applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former Members of the ODS Ivan Fuksy, Mark Schnajdra and Peter Fat, Petr Knötig said that they could not be punished for any crimes until they gave up the parliamentary mandate last November.
By this decision, the Court rejected the motion of Prosecutor Ivo Ištán, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former Prime Minister who offered them these positions can be prosecuted further.
He and Vít Barta also arrested an anti-corruption police officer.
Bart's attorney, Oldřich Povera, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption by the MPs, also did not want to comment on the case, but he said: "Yes, I represent the client also in this matter, but I cannot comment on this further, given the protection of classified information."
According to information, the case is dealt with by the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS).
Server tn.cz said that Bart could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server first zpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former Police President Peter Lessy, whom he allegedly sought to appoint as Bart.
But the latest information on the Law shows that the detention of Vita Bárta has nothing to do with Peter Lessy.
A spokesperson for the Police Presidium Eva Kropačová refused to comment on the case that the case was dealt with by the Prague City Attorney's Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said the spokesperson of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, Štěpánka Zenklová on Friday.
It is the applicant who oversees Bart's case, and it is therefore indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the secrecy regime.
The reporter Novinek was able to reach his wife Vít Bárta Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their residence in Prague Klarov.
She was just loading her bags in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn of Tomio Okamura commented on Bart's arrest.
In his words, he has no idea what's going on in the case.
"Vít Barta was one of many candidates of many parties on our candidate, and, as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Dawn of the Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who, during the previous early elections to the House of Plzeň Region, has been unsuccessfully running for the Dawn of the Direct Democracy movement Tomia Okamura, is known for his corrupt payment of the Members of the Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Then the sentence was changed and Bart was acquitted.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have the juice, the lust and the enthusiasm
For Sleepy, there was always a family first, which is why he wants to give in to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and he's gonna extend his career, or he's definitely gonna quit hockey.
"I want to play the role of daddy and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he's a well-known worker who will never cheat anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can tear down his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he reports resolutely.
It may be worth it, allegedly, the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season, and who have injured two foothills - Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan's attackers.
What does your arrival at the Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere was ever delivered that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but I just don't.
You haven't heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
It's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
Like when a player gets hurt or someone's bad at it and the team doesn't work.
There are a lot of different factors that need to come together to get the contract.
But in New York, things like this happen, don't they?
The wounded is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan, and the team failed to enter the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The other thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
You're leaving for America on Friday, expecting something to work after all?
I've had those expectations since July 5th, when the free-player market opened up in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and everything depends on that.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna play the role of dad and husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
On Sunday, Vashík has two hockey games, it's a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go support our kids in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in full-time quotes?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen, too.
I tried it on three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I loved it so much.
One day it gets so far, all the goals, the victories and the passes won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me except for my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, sports success belongs to first place - except for the family.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life depends on.
My children, I'm sorry, our children - my wife and I - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would love for them to continue this trend.
Because as far as we can tell, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else entirely.
We should offer them that chance.
So you plan on staying in America permanently?
We'll practice it like we used to.
This means that in summer we will be in the Czech Republic on Deep and in the surroundings of České Budějovice.
And in the winter, in Tampa or wherever our steps lead us.
It's perfect to be warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say I went across the street to him, it took a lot of power and saying and it took away a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to do this so they can choose what they're gonna do and how they're gonna live.
How long will you have the will to work hard, train hard, and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it's gonna stay there.
There's no way to plan that.
So it's safe to say that this season, you wait and see how it plays out, and then you decide what to do next?
I'm at the point where I go day by day.
The CEO of ČEZ recently announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th block of the Temelín power plant was postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified it by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and by agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the Government.
These are the reasons why the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should make a recommendation to the shareholders, not hide behind them.
The government only with Sobotka.
Andrei Babiš is beginning to accept that his YES movement will not have time to learn the political craft in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
President YES admitted it in an interview for the Law, which will come out tomorrow.
Business and Marketing of School Finu led by Abraham
Its competences include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
In office, Ludek replaced Shantora.
Abraham has linked his career to the automotive sector for the past 14 years.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for seven years for Alfa Romeo brand and dealers.
His last place of business was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
The school FIN was founded in 1992.
Police evacuated part of Los Angeles Airport for shooting.
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of it, allegedly it was terminal three.
The Reuters Agency, referring to the California media, claims that the law's men shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times reported that there was a shootout involving two or three members of the Transport Security Service who were injured.
How many people have been injured and whether there are any victims, but it's still not clear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more wounded.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military planes allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latákiya on Thursday.
With reference to an unnamed official of the U.S. government, CNN TV announced it.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government failed to confirm the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli army, at CNN's request, refused to comment on the raid.
"We do not comment on reports from foreign media," she said.
According to the US government's source of missile and related equipment, Israel's view was the target of the Israeli raid, which could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP, referring to another American security officer, informed that Russian SA-125 missiles were the target of an Israeli raid on a target on Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
According to DPA, satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125-type missiles.
In addition, it was said that the SA-3 missile batteries, including a command centre with radar to track missiles and their targets, were visible on them.
According to a report by Israeli television, the missiles are within 35 kilometers and could carry 70 kilograms of warheads.
Israel has allegedly bombed at least twice this year the supply of missiles inside Syria, including CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed that it will affect any supply of weapons intended for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to have successfully resisted this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and is expecting record profits from recruits in Australia and the UK.
The Agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to be between USD 325 and 340 million compared to USD 305 to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12-17% increase in the record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011 / 2012.
The CEO of Graham Turner said that Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year, and the second half began with a sharp growth mainly in Australian and British travel away from business trips.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards record annual profits before interest and taxation," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our greatest creators of profit.
Entrepreneurship with recreational activities has recovered during the second half of Australia, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while corporate clients spent less.
America's trade has recovered during the seasonally weaker half-year, and is expected to make a third year's profit in a row.
Flight Centre's shares were yesterday 3 cents higher at USD 38,20.
Greenpeace activists who were detained in Russia were transferred to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September in protest against planned oil extraction in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
Today, AFP has informed about this with reference to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the original allegations of her activists from piracy have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women, held in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil rig, were transported from the Murmansk Correctional Facility to a prison in St. Petersburg," announced the organisation in its statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear; according to DPA, this was a planned transfer.
Ecology authorities first accused them of piracy, which, in the event of a conviction, was worth up to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace this charge with a more moderate riot which threatened a lower sentence with a maximum of seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace pointed out in today's statement that the piracy charges have not yet been dropped, as they promised.
That means the detainees are now charged with two crimes.
The Mighty Committee of Investigation announced last week that they would replace the charge of piracy with the charge of disorderly conduct.
But when 30 prisoners were brought before the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, a new accusation was made against everyone, "quoted the AFP in Greenpeace's statement.
In mid-September, the Russians apprehended three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom's oil platform.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody against whom they have appealed, but the court has dismissed them all.
Ecologists complain about prison conditions.
According to AFP, Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said today that moving to St. Petersburg would facilitate meetings with families and consular staff.
But there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they may be worse," he pointed out.
One of the detainees, Faiza Oulahsen, has asked for help from Dutch King Willem-Alexander.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch was invited to discuss their situation in a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Málliki has a big part in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is also said to be part of the fighting in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature, at least one of Shakespeare's plays, 19th century novels, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include "hidden text 'to motivate deeper reading;
The combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a language exam and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other major subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees graduation examinations, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, together with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a 'broad consensus on whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain the trust of society', and that we need to insist that the graduation exam be 'more demanding, ambitious and stricter'.
The study shows that English schools spend less time in mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
For comparison schools in Australia pay an average of 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have indicated that a comprehensive graduation exam from mathematics - together with a greater emphasis on this subject in the scoreboard - will probably encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-smoldering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within Ostrava's CSSSD erupted.
Everything culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to court for an undemocratic compilation of candidates.
Yet the case actors did not want to comment too much on this so that they would not harm the party even more before the elections.
But now the votes of the voters are numbered.
On Monday evening, the head of the Ostrava CSPD called on the mayor of Ostrava to step out of the party, and he will probably also push to lose his post.
But Peter Caynar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on in the controversy and who's on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for Diary.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
I'm sure the CSPD was counting on a much better outcome.
Has it been damaged in our country that disputes within the party were resolved in the media before the elections?
I imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, this corresponds to the state in which CSSD is now in.
It's a party that has internal problems, is internally ill, and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
I think the ODS has been going through bankruptcy for some time now, and unfortunately, things like this are now taking place in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebendas at the ODS, have moved to the people in the CSRS and have an influence on them.
Then it has to do with the fact that police are walking around the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate and collecting computers.
It shows that the CSPD is not just made up of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps even in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Hashkovci and Sobotkovci.
But that's been going on for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a premonition of what is happening now in Prague.
Hashka's wing was gradually taking up positions so that, after the election, it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotko's wing.
One is in politics in a situation where sometimes one has to compromise.
But everyone has an internal line where you can't compromise anymore, and that's my case, too.
I didn't want to run for House originally, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I made a deal with Luboš Zaoralk to try to get on the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotka's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
Hashka's wing gave it a break.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Hasek?
In my opinion, Sobotka Slavek is a person who always talks about the CSSSD program and, to some extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I'll admit, I've never heard anything like it from the other side.
Michal Hasek is only fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can start simply calling off the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the Party's statutes.
In my opinion, what Michal Hasek has now demonstrated in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How you felt that the Ostrava leadership of the CSPD did not approve you of the candidate.
Political parties are based on a competition that will place both their members.
The competition should be based, for the most part, on program visions and on the ability of these people to fulfill those visions.
But, of course, people who don't have a lot of skills or visions are also taking part in this competition, but the political party is an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to come to the forefront because they break rules without scruples, they break party statutes.
With their practices, they make political parties into mafia and, in my opinion, they violate the laws of the Czech Republic as well.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether or not there is a political future for some Caynar.
It is important that the parties start to respect the statutes.
Therefore, before the elections, did you apply to the court for interim measures against the form of a candidate for the CSPD in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava strengthens its power by enabling organisations that do not comply with it to abolish, set up new organisations, gradually firing inconvenient members of the party.
An example of this is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarík from the representative's club, but he brought an action against it, and then they cancelled the resolution on his expulsion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the Party's statutes through the courts is the last option, but the moment that the other ways and control bodies within the CSDB have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The attempt to lead the Ostrava CSSD, led by Mr Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It's a public secret that the mayor of Poruba Lumír Palyza has a crush on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and for those votes, they strengthen their power in the party.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the stadium Bazala was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me as the person who puts the money where it doesn't belong.
Yet the city has purchased assets that are strategically of great value to it.
So how do you continue to feel about staying as mayor?
The District Committee has already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in CSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Catch a thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last 11 years, I see no one in Ostrava's social democracy who would initiate and promote, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it unless I'm interfering with others to get to the places they want to be.
Will you continue to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, then political parties must function well.
I find it hard to believe that any party will be able to control the state effectively if they can't even control themselves.
So I'm not thinking about leaving the CSRS now, because I think that whoever's causing cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to push me out.
Olomouc opens a public rink in the historical centre
The organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Šlový stated that the preparatory work at the ice rink started on 26 October and since Wednesday the ice production aggregate has been in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 sqm, the stage took 358 sqm.
Both skaters and bystanders will also have two punch stands.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stalls and almost the entire stage area is covered so that the skaters can comfortably change," described the Burnt.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the coming Christmas.
Last year, due to the repair of the Lower Square, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the Town Hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate in front of the city hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched in the Upper Square one month before Christmas Eve.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín will again be dealt with by the county court
The Regional Court acquitted 25-year-old Slovak and 22-year-old Czech Republic for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the guilt.
They're looking at 15 to 20 years in prison, or even an exceptional punishment.
Spokesperson Peter Angyalossy confirmed that the supreme court of the county had annulled the decision and brought the matter back to him for consideration.
The reasons why the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, the young men ambushed a 75-year-old man in his house.
Senior died a torturous death.
According to the prosecution, he was strangled, beaten, and kicked all over his body, and also by a metal object, probably a gas gun, put about three dozen blows to the head.
A man has suffered severe injuries, such as skull fractures, brain swelling, and bleeding into the brain that he succumbed to on-site.
The young people allegedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewels worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the county court, they were the only, and only circumstantial, evidence against the defendants, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal instructions.
While the scent marks from the crime scene and other cases coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as material and not odour marks.
Plus, there were some mistakes in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the defendant's guilt has not been proven without a doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
She didn't mention the violent deaths or the call of a medical examiner to the emergency services.
It was only after a few days that the CSIs contacted the Olomouc doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the clues from the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
There was no DNA found at the scene.
Young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving the sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed last year by a final Olomouc Supreme Court.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men responsible for the robbery of a jewelry store.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopne.
The younger accused of murdering a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo starts reconstruction of stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who would reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the Znojmo Town Stadium is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strune Autumn
The saxophone giant and the legend of Wayne Shorter's jazz scene will do a dot next Wednesday behind the 18th year of Struna Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Great Hall of Lucerna together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia, led by Martin Kumžák, is added to Shorter.
In Shorter's adjustments for the symphonic orchestra will be the composition Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, as demonstrated by the fact that the Prague concert on Struna autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world over 60 years ago.
The list of interpreters he worked with goes from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade gave direction of new style fusion.
For the past 13 years, he's been performing mainly with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
The afterparty after the festival will be a club night Spotlight, which will be held on November 9 at the Roxy / NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Czech audience will present the Manchester Trio Go Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damko says she forbids UEFA to publish sentences for referees.
Dagmar Damková, Chairman of the Referee Committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It is forbidden by the UEFA rules, which was stated in the Interview for the Law Journal.
Otherwise, FACR would be threatened with sanctions.
Damková also refused to side with the football players of Pilsen where she came from in her capacity.
These speculation are really meaningless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the committee are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1: 6, "said Damková, in response to a criticism that has rebelled after Pilsen has recently played twice as many penalts as other league teams.
Thus, although the FACR has stopped publishing sentences for referees in recent months, Damková assures that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit the delegation, whatever the match," said Damko.
According to the Damko ban from the European Football Union, the reason why the punishments are not published is the reason why they are not published.
"UEFA forbids the disclosure of such information and punishes the infringement."
"We're very suspicious here, and for every mistake, we're looking for something."
"We have made the restrictions public, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be severe sanctions," said Damko.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were indeed an exception," she added.
If information were to continue to be published, the Commission could lose money from UEFA to raise and develop referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not complete the referee education programme," said Damková.
The capture of Bart is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leak of the wiretaps?
Police arrested the President of the Public Vitus Bart on Thursday.
The head of the Department of Analytics and Informatics was arrested with him by the anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
Information about wiretaps, which came with the Novinky.cz server, was confirmed by the Czech Press Office's trusted source.
Listened phone calls by Janoušek and Bém, published in March last year by the Young Front Today, in which both men call each other "Mazánek" and "Hummingbird," show Janoušek's influence on the city's steps under Bém's leadership.
At the time, the diary stated that it was acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the security agency ABL.
That's what Bart owned back then.
Server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detainee CSI Petržílek worked for the BIS just before he joined the anti-corruption police.
To the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretaps, Parsley crossed at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything at all," said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case doesn't want to comment on inspections for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new civil code
Six out of ten companies have been intensively preparing for the impending effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporation Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the companies questioned said that they did not discuss matters related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This results from the Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal investigation, which looked at the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching date of effectiveness of both key codes, only now at the last minute, many managers are starting to realize how much they can have a significant impact on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has long lived in uncertainty about whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually happen, owing to the blending of politicians.
"But now they only have a few weeks left for the transition to new law to take place for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte's partner Jan Spážil.
Of 61% of companies intensively engaged in new laws, 26% said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Furthermore, 35 per cent of these companies are going to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Every fifth firm has not yet dealt with this, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for it.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet dealt with the issues related to the recodification.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21%) for the largest number of companies questioned, followed by a solution to business conditions (16%) and changes in the property register and liability (10%).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the whole reprogradication will take place, namely the unification of the contract arrangements only under the new civil code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercial Code will cease to exist, as a result of which contract law should become clearer for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many innovations with emphasis on greater freedom of organisation of relationships," said Advocate Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luke Subdaná.
In the context of the Commercial Corporation Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important issue.
The following are the topics concerning the changes in the assembly and the course of the general meeting (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially when a company is threatened with bankruptcy or falls into it.
"In practice, this means that if directors and managers do not deal with the care of a proper economy and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit they have earned for the last two years," he added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier style develop as a living language
My job is to preserve tradition while leading our brand to modern things so that it does not remain dusty relics, clarifies Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier, in an interview for HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care at the Cameroon villages.
Bwell and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwell is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Hero Prize.
In the CNN Hero Prize 2013 contest, you can vote for him or for any of the ten main candidates.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde.
At first, he was only being treated with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he created a hematoma that had caused him problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwell.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5: 00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to get there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 inhabitants.
Just to compare, the ratio in the United States is one doctor of 413 inhabitants.
And even if Dr. Cameroon could visit, many wouldn't be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwell.
With poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwell saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteer team performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at a central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members attend rural areas where they provide free medical care at the weekend.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people get stuffed into the vans, attached to the rooftops of medical supplies, and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They're not always accompanied by luck.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as true heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason to celebrate, and Bwell - with his wide smile and unbridled energy - is very willingly involved in local cheer.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every quest," says Bwell.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometer radius on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free - a document that requires a school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing simple surgeries under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in the school building, city hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for another patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating room and the sanitary equipment of Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not lose their motivation.
"To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night long," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group - consisting of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students - carried out 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
A man said he'd be able to work again after the hernia surgery.
"It will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that it is this second work that finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he's actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who's a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteering for the Bwelle Group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing services like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We washed Dr. Bwell's hands thoroughly and removed blood stains or held his instruments," says O'Malley.
As a second-year med student in America, you'll never experience that.
Students volunteers usually pay their way to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, food, transportation and study provide them with Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle's constant hitch is not a burden.
Helping others live more happily, fulfilling the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," says Bwell.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain - that's why I do it.
Take a look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát renewed the function of Head Sister for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function should be clearly defined and formalised, that nurses should have a representative within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they can always turn, if necessary," said Martin Holcát, Minister for Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses, and I think he deserves due attention from the Ministry as well.
In the pursuit of this profession, it is not only high professional professionalism, but also human approach and personal beliefs that are needed.
"I will gladly, and with all responsibility, strive to enforce those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skillful nurses in our health care system, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who are not helping us with their approach to patients, to carry out their calls with all empathy and to help us improve the image of nurses in the public eye," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová also stated on the occasion of her entry into office that she wants to deal with various aspects of the job of a nurse and intends to cooperate, among other things, with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I do not want to divide the profession of doctors and nurses, but, on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, with everyone having their powers and, together with other health workers, they are a team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their resolution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks burden nurses unnecessarily and deprive them of time which they could and should rather spend on patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with each other in the team and with the management of health service providers, adapting competences and also labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or overburdening nurses with their insufficient numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous desires, but they are not documented on a specific case, for fear of possible sanctions, where violations could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and thus the function of Head Sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such a complaint and have a specific case examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Central Medical School in the field of Medical Sister (graduated in 1978) and from the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursing - pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical disciplines and recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse in the internal ward, and she was also a teacher at the Central Medical School, where she was also the principal's statutory representative for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as head nurse of the Czech Prison Service.
She published several technical textbooks of nursing and articles in specialized journals, she devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
So I don't get caught up in hate.
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After long years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it is not a small volume, suggests the number of pages comparable to his best known work by Housky (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahuda, another prominent Czech writer of the present day - Emil Hakl.
What moved that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't get caught up in hate.
To see around you constantly new and new clones of that foolish human trifle, young organisms affected by blind, selfish efforts.
I'm not talking about the elders, faces ruined by helpless lust, Veclan souls, and reverse-polled ideologists trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a little sales whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a little digital camera and filmed my judie friends, weirdos, and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I can feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I like to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamp tonight.
You're talking about a sense of loss, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break came a long time ago, about ten years old.
It didn't have a name at the time.
Well, that's what I lived for.
There's still a quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see more alone trainers, everyone in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved writing books.
I'm participating in the giant, thousands of years of the movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an unwieldy future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is a direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games where the way of trial-error arises another generation of beings, which in billions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artitial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-speaking, or rather, a dialogue that leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
Like the periods of peace intertwined by the quietly sleeping metastases of wars, which may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt a silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I don't do something, one day, it's gonna shut me down.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and lays them down to layers that are stored in the darkness "beneath the surface of consciousness."
Neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, asks the older evolutionary bodies, goes to the ancient circles of the brain tree.
He talks to fur beasts, asks snakes, seeks answers in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to ego metaphorically - can you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its cognitive, cognitive, process, being exposed to an ever-changing presence, in a constant effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there's an overload disorder.
Analogically - as if you "fell" PC, from the program of speech emulator and translators from foreign languages you would first get tangled in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts you end up at the dark green flashing screen of Bios, in the basic system that controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention her a lot - why are you regularly interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the aftermath of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, a gap appears.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He looked into the abyss until the abyss looked into it."
A pure feeling - that a man is lost, if all hope is lost, he "dies" mentally and starts a new quality.
And why do I care in person?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once one fell into a pool and drowned, running days, months and years, he was still drowning and reading, and the books taught him how to swim - that is, to live.
He became a "diver."
Perhaps someone will be helped by a sentence written by me, as the texts of Hrabal once helped me.
To what extent do you think about the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
The one who can't say anything meaningful, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
Since early youth, he has read the books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nemo, ran on the Shadows in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their messages, the sun is clear to the worlds of other Karel Hynek Mácha.
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the reflection that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them through some difficult life decision with my book.
Books are actually "lives," or rather, "worlds."
They are encoded in letters, bearing the experience, the history of the regions of that language.
Whenever we can bring them back to life, we let their sentences flow to the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to ancient demonic books, we commit witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, as usual, there is a chain of authorial reading waiting for you.
I remember you used to love to read.
Are you going to throw yourself back into this again with pleasure, or do you feel differently after all these years?
I prefer to just talk today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic emblem - they're stealth, they don't pay much attention to each other, they have friendly radiations, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give you an example - in the town of Red Kostelec there was (and I hope there is still) one curly bookseller (it is conveniently called Red), a cheerful fellow and a good girl bull.
In one leech, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Housky.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a crushed, reaped specimen of my book.
Embarrassed, I laid aside the just-numbered sap and wept briefly man-like.
We all stood there in silence, wobbling and drunk with tears.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't stand it and jumped head-on out the window into a snow dung.
It was downstairs.
We ran into the night landscape and slaughtered with happy rabies of the sensitive, aching soul of the landscapes and the loss of the fallen patriots - howled and moved like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and factually different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, dark, present?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts in the mouth of a folk healer the words of an old Russian myth: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog lying on it, a gray chest.
Terrible, terrible, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps once upon a time we were devils in hell and drew lots - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free tide of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a remarkable way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from so deep and so wide that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so we are doing exactly in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a glitch, and we light up compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves humans.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the ocean coast unconscious, and into the leaky sail made of a dirty handkerchief catches the tides of warm wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama retreats from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama retreated yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
With reference to hundreds of thousands of statements made by Republican providers in recent days, the President has been accused of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday Obama flung away from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with working health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called "media turmoil" about statements, Obama called on the Americans who received these announcements to seek out new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care programme at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population that purchased insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on Available Care.
"I am telling these Americans straight: you deserve better," said Subolius in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Suliusová, who oversees the implementation of the Act on Available Care, said that the launch of the Internet market has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
The irritated Sulius said this sentence, which was captured by the microphone on, yesterday in the direction of the advisor sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee meeting, which took place after a turbulent exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was concerned with whether she had to participate in Obama's care programme.
More than three hours during the Sulius hearing, he repeatedly questioned the question of why the "architect" of the Law on Available Care did not voluntarily give up the government-sponsored insurance, and did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which is now imposing millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you gonna be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from agencies and backstage, they say the hand is up.
The transaction notice should come in November, probably before the LTE frequency auction, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns KKCG.
Under the brand Sazka Telecommunications, it has launched an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, there was no talk of the company's desire to infiltrate telecommunications.
But now Sazek is led by a very experienced telecom man Robert Hrutal.
He started as the marketing head of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became director of the Slovak T-Mobile and last managed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafon.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like that under normal circumstances, but according to the information of the Economic Paper, it may be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing O2 and T-Mobile operators, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE network tendra (as a newcomer can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go into the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone can share the networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will release Sazka into its 2G / 3G network (or a newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In the meantime, the Sazka will build a costly LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend his savings on some fixed-internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) and would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big moloch that's going to be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, LTE would have won Kellner for O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that networks will be shared.
The auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
As of next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever do without signing events?
She stepped into the era of President Zeman through a legendary scene with an ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that gather evidence of the ploughing up of the castle squad.
In the past, the tragic influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Harbinger has not been documented in this way, let alone signed under it.
True, the editors stood up for the leadership.
However, the cases described do not provide an answer to the question of where such the affinity of some journalists to the grounders is taken - whether it is a response to a direct order or, in order not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathic friendliness.
And, when we assume general rot, we cannot ignore the question of whether other, equally unscrupulous, power-driven interests that have not yet been given the opportunity to change the circumstances on television.
The truth is those who say that there are no obvious attempts to intervene politicians in developed countries.
The truth, however, is that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
They criticise, on the contrary, what they consider to be their own tendencies, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilisation stage yet, and this situation is not with us.
But also in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about evil politicians and good journalists may be more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a precarious situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collides.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of force
It is almost a rule that, at the key moments of the country, the head of the state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfil its statesmanship obligations.
If T. Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency, and the events around Munich would have been a little different.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the Air Force could fly off the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, the nation wouldn't have been hungover from the surrender until today.
Beneš was not a statesman, and he was still fit for Munich, but during the war he started to go downhill and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
Being a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
Too bad about Hach.
He was elected "Mr. President will not get in the position of making decisions."
But he had to, although the big decision-making was probably not with a knife around Hitler's neck in the chancellor's office.
To the last days of March 1939, Franz Moravec's intelligence board said what should be done to ensure that the occupation that he knew about for the day was not so smooth and so profitable for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, they both didn't believe him, they both feared him.
The human wreckage Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow ordered.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely unable to participate in normalization and had to be deposed, already senile.
That Husák was a helpless and sick depressed old man made it easier in November 89, but that's the only good thing.
Havel was lucky he hadn't been in office in years, spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his actions show that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look like they do, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat of external threat to the Republic now.
Or maybe it's a threat, just not visible.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally (from a historical point of view), it is not a good thing that the President is not fully strong.
It's not a normal condition.
Can't we elect someone acceptable-minded and acceptable-healthy once again in this country?
Remote planets, black and white movies, or a little fantasy of alien life on earth, are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw lightly.
In the concept of his quartet, which will close this year's year's Struna Autumn Festival in the great hall of Lucerna in Prague on November 6, everything is related to everything.
Wayne Shorter's jazz saxophonist quartet is a part of the current feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they're experiencing right now.
They treat music as a completely improvised chamber matter and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film pictures.
This principle, however, is recently eighty-year-old Shorter - the extraordinary composer, the bearer of nine Grammy, the former teammate of Miles Davis, and now perhaps the largest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80s, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything, and then they're disappointed when things turn out differently," says Shorter.
How the Insects of Thailand raised the sales of the Paris bar
Maybe you'll smirk at the insects, and yet you don't know that you'll eat them completely on your own for about half a kilo a year.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it knowingly, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience taken care of.
He placed the insect offer first in Paris on the menu of his establishment in early October, Eli Daviron, the cook and owner of Le Festin Nu.
The bar, which was inspired by the book William Burroughs Naked Lunch, would be found in the fashion 18th district near Montmartre by a widely visited tourist.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can now eat not only different larvae, locusts or water beetles, but also scorpions.
Careful and specially packaged deliveries (so that insects do not damage wings, break legs or damage eyes) send Davion all the way from Thailand.
Europe is still learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Parisian bar with pioneering menus presents several reasons why they consume insects.
The first is an environmental benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for the Reuters station.
At the same time, a young cook does not deny his profession, simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant gives pleasure, a sense of sin, and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just providing a new experience," he consecrated.
By far, not everyone would be thrilled by the idea of consuming a bug decorated with pesto, but the reactions of customers at the Paris bar to the served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
Even sceptics are supposed to taste eventually, even though they start with the smallest bites and then eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been faced with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and a lack of interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
Announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save significant amounts of heating after the implementation of the measure, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring the state more than 2700 newly created jobs.
In terms of fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are important, and they are also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the Government's resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps as would allow further continuation of the programme so that further calls can be made within it.
JUSTICE, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches.
On Thursday, President Milos Zeman left the motor hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to a castle in Lány.
What kind of medical condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "went too far"
John Kerry suggested a softening of the US's defense stance on its surveillance programs and said in an unprecedented confession that, in some cases, espionage "went too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for treating NSA espionage as "autopilot" because of the informant Edward Snowden.
Published information has triggered a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, by means of a video-link at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have indeed learned about some of the things that have been happening out of inertia, because this was the possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, 9 / 11."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but he pointed out that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain it to people and clarify it, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA's organization sought good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He said, "We're dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to murder and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
On Thursday, the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that US legislators were going to Europe to respond to the concerns of foreign countries concerning alleged American espionage, and convinced Europeans that they needed to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others, and that he is concerned about their threats to stop their participation in anti-terrorism organisations because they are disillusioned by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Indeed, it is important for the US's national-security interests that Europe stay on board with us, with a view to joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said Murphy in an interview from Washington, a member of the Democratic Party, and the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations on European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at NSA programs.
News in the media that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has disrupted relations with some American allies, even though the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstandings of the metadata that NATO's allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another revelation quoted the documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
The National Intelligence Director James Clapper advocated the espionage of the allies as necessary and said that it was a common matter on both sides.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary path that should take place this year, hoping that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to be involved are to be published.
He said there was still work on the program.
Although Murphy said that the aim of the trip was to help correct relations, he added that "well-meaning educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have been using for years.
"While we adjust our monitoring programs to better protect Europeans' rights, they must also realise that we are not the only ones doing espionage here," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is headed to the Middle East and Poland this weekend, as planned, to respond to the hostility triggered by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activity.
The Australian has appealed against staying in a Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to a 15-day prison on Phuket Island, falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with false charges by a court on the island of Phuket on June 15 when she told the Thai police that a taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly held her, attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, the industrial television footage later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police conducted interviews with Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up a story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security penitentiary in Phuket instead of being put in an adult prison.
She's the daughter of a former Australian league player, Peter Tunks, who applied for help in his daughter's case by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously this is a difficult time, but we hope that he will return to us safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed against the sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime, she spent her vacation in the Krabi recreational area in the south of Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in an adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct a damaged image for tourists, which was perhaps just behind the liberating verdict.
Jagr made a joke: "Goal from the glasses"?
He got the puck in the defense zone, and no one caught him again.
Moreover, the escape was transformed after a quick forehand loop.
Jaromir Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, Thursday night then the 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After seeing this video, my agent Peter Svobov heard from the head of the Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their latest Pendolino train!" he wrote on the introduction with the overstatement Jagr.
I hear we look a lot like each other.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit my night practice so I don't get any faster.
"I fear that the Minister of Defence may then speak up and would like to advertise on jets!" added emojis.
In addition, New Jersey has a second win in a row.
"And most importantly, you've noticed - Maria Rotter's treatment is working," concluded Jagr.
Place of post-election tenderloin goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that did not even reach the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. COS), but also the previous governmental parties (ODS, TOP 09), and eventually the CSDB because of its internal dissolution.
Politicians served us a post-election stew on the weekend instead of a holiday candle.
Andrei Babiš, who promised voters to change the political style of governance so far, was the jumper of the elections.
The fragmentation of the election result and the dissension in the victorious party records the political will of President Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the electorate, who neither publicly supported nor elected the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the House of Deputies.
While the President has lost his strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he has several ways to get it back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the CSPD is moving away from the chance of obtaining a prime minister's seat in my eyes, the entrepreneurs of Andrej Babiš are getting closer.
While the post-election development is miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the CSSR supported by the Communists, this development is better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Due to the vocal resistance of YES to get together with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant of the Coalition of ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (total of 111 Members) is still the most likely.
Due to the dissolution in the CSDP, which thus became an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations can be quite daunting for CSSD.
The Minority Government of the CSDP, composed of "non-grounders" in the Castle, is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government to which the CSDP will participate will be threatened by the dissatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to another dissension in the party.
So I ask myself: 'Are we not going to go ahead with another early election?'
The next election would be more of a referendum on the power of the electoral mandate of the YES movement.
ČSSD plans to introduce sector taxes, increase income taxes more significantly, or build a state bank, hopefully fell under the table.
On the contrary, ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Dawn are in agreement, for example, on the promotion of entrepreneurship, on moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged persons, on the reduction of the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The third areas are most present in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
But YES now has the upper hand, so the program so far most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be leaning to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better outcome than a left-wing tax program for everything that is still moving in the economy.
