I'm sure they're very proud of their daughter.
Tom turned right and Mary went to the other side.
There's one left.
He started explaining what happened.
Tom has a stomach made of cast iron, he can eat almost anything.
Mother didn't know what to do with her son.
He knows wine.
Tom could feel someone tapping on his shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words will say how wonderful you are.
I'd like some fruit juice.
Is it gonna rain tomorrow?
The wedge font invented by Sumery was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I like summer, but I can't stand the heat.
Of course I do!
Mary loves you.
What can I get you?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found yourself a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her hands before eating.
I haven't talked to anyone about it.
Don't get used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high tip on his desk.
Nothing like a glass of beer after a day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
So far, I'm satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's my map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you might be dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
The dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight ahead and then to the right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's going to be 13 the day after tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch her ruin her life.
Do everything in your right mind.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
This belt is too tight for me.
Playing the bassoon isn't easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly dying out today.
Tom's still busy.
You'd better leave now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut off the rope.
I'm sorry to bother you, I just came to apologize.
Tom's not gonna help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train must have stopped because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a costumed party from the seventeenth century.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
He climbed a tree with great effort.
It is very difficult to translate Czech text.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing, too.
We already know all that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought it to my attention.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.

She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen on you?
They're not helping.
I like the tie.
We didn't do as well as we wanted.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joan have a fight?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need this more than you do.
He bought a car.
I'm afraid I'm stuck here forever.
Tom had an enema.
What should I do in this situation?
You take the train to school?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom going to visit?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary's.
Why don't you buy me a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me if it happens.
He's single.
That's not what people normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as a flea when she got her record deal.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's going to visit his uncle.
Everybody's out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary could.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There aren't enough seats in the conference room.
Tom never recovered.
I told Tom he was a fake boyfriend, and he was offended.

He waved at her.
I was late for school this morning.
I took part in the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We cut through the lawn by the river.
Tom never drank hard alcohol.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm perfectly happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There used to be half-broken walls.
I spoke to him in English, and he found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.
When did any of you talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence is freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You got fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written as instructed.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about divorcing her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own two feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we had a seizure of laughter.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did this for me.
Tom knows what he's going to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse is screaming.
I lent Tom a comb.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not so stubborn anymore.

If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we're going hiking.
Try talking to the police.

Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I assume he's gone home.
I was in the woods.

I made a terrible decision.
I'd better get back inside.
She doesn't have to do that.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
He has his own house.
I don't usually do that at night.

I expected them to tell the truth.
Sweep it under the mat.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's tight.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.

Throw the ball to Tom.
I insult her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I was a better person.
Stealing, huh?
Tom has to comb his hair.
You should consult a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
Tom's used to that.
I love this book.
The trash's clogged up again.

This works.
Stop yelling.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not satisfied.
Can the message be true?
Easy come, easy go.
