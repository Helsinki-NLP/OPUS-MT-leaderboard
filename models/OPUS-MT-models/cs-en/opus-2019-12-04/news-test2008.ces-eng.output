Inflation in Europe jumped for food
The accelerated inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November price increases in 13 euro area countries were above expectations, with annual inflation of 3.1% registered at 2.6% in October, announced by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast assumed only 3 percent, provided by Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate, with the reduction leading to an inflation spiral, along with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below two percent, but close to it.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "discourage inflation" so that it does not have to do anything later.
In Germany, November inflation is a 15-year record of 3.3%; in Spain, it rose from 3.6% to 4.1%.
Inflation in the euro area has gone up due to rising food and energy prices.
The term price of wheat has risen by 88 percent, and also the course of soy has reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007, much more had to be paid for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets increased by 52% this year, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate over the next 3-4 months will remain approximately 3%, but its average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz's circle of supporters increased significantly after prolonged stagnation in early December, and so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of Socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured 13% support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater resolve of the opposition voters - would be more than two-thirds (71%) of the support compared to one-fifth of the support of the MPMI.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for parliamentary entry: their support across the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters are supporters of both camps by one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has deteriorated in view of the previous minimum - never before has the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while the other 46 percent makes the situation rather bad.
Families now assess the change in their material situation after spring and summer prospects in a more pessimistic way.
As far as next year is concerned, a larger part of the population is counting on further deterioration and only a tenth of the population is counting on improvement.
In December, 71% of the enquires, most of all of the Gallup Institute's research, judged that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsánys believes or very much believes 13 percent of the enquires, while Victor Orbán has 38 percent of the supporters.
The Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent, the chairman of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that discontent with the Prime Minister can be resolved without changing the government.
While, after last October's riots, the government and the Prime Minister considered it desirable to remain 35%, at present, this share is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees a solution only in the launch of new elections.
For the interest in a referendum, it is evident that 60% of the respondents responded to a question regarding their possible participation, that it would certainly come to the referendum and another 20% said that it would probably come.
To compare, the "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly be only 55 percent, and another 15 percent would consider their participation probable. The success of the referendum would be undoubted on the basis of current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, medical fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only within a range of people who are certainly promising to participate, the introduction of tuition fees, medical fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth of the price of Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Budapest Trade Triangle maintained last year's, on average, 16% increase in price levels, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Napi Gazdaság article
The usual Christmas consumption basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budapest Trade Triangle has increased by 16 percent on average this year, but in all hypermarkets, more than a thousand forints have been shown to increase in price.
As the prices in the food supermarkets "flew out" in December last year, the percentage of the previous high base did not show such a drastic price.
But it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could purchase last year at a price below 9,000 forints will not be available for ten thousand now.
The daily economy consumption basket in the examined hypermarkets exceeded the psychological threshold of 10,000 forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but they undercut very bad breasts, nuts and also poppy.
The prices of bread and flour were consistent with those of the Central Statistical Office, although we found a kilo of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
Competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of a 2-litre Coca Cola in a refundable bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the advance cost only 257 forints.
But this year, according to the consumer basket, Napi Gazdaság Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora appeared to be the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság increased by 15, compared to the prices of Cora last Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan increased by around 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and this year's lowest consumer basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In the forints, the increase was on average 1,480.
The average price increase last year was 1,206 forints, with prices being influenced by VAT increases last Christmas.
It is this process that has disrupted the trade, which has obviously failed to decide how large the price range should be set for individual products, because they have not been able to predict what effect the change in prices will have on consumption.
(If the trader plans the rate of circulation of the product wrong, it may lose a significant profit due to the price range adapted to the volume of circulation.)
Last year, due to VAT, the rise in the price of Napi Gazdaság's consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest was the price difference of all-purpose 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference was not revealed, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest price of 1,284 forints.
When comparing both Christmas seasons, a disastrous price increase emerged; in less than 20 months, the daily consumption goods in hypermarkets were undercut by more than 30 percent.
(Among other things, this does not absolutely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the daily economy's consumption basket, this seems almost impossible, as the price level of the product, quite expensive as of last year, showed a price increase of barely more than 10%, even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in stronger positions than egg suppliers, and they managed to push drastic price increases in international chains as well.
Hypermarkets in the trading gold triangle do not complain, they still report on a good year.
In our experience, most customers in three shops are no longer interested in prices.
They buy all of it, they take durable food on pay.
On Wednesday morning in all three supermarkets there were long queues at the coffers, as the number of visitors rose sharply.
However, as we know, in the countryside, turnover is lower, with several international chains complaining to research firms that sales are also lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also durable consumer goods.
In many places, it saves on disinfectants.
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection, mainly due to inappropriate antibiotic use, were registered in hospitals.
The sanitation conditions of hospitals, overloading beds, overloading the staff is not helping to stop the disease, says the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places it is also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma ward of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who entered the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return with an MRSA infection and due to a bacterium found in his body one major operation could not yet be performed.
By 10 December this year, 1 094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents were reported to the Nesocomialis Surveillance National System, Karolina Böröcz, the primary of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents have been registered with certainty in hospitals, others are not known.
Almost two thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staph.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are carried by a third of the people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. cervical inflammation, almond inflammation, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an exaggerated or inappropriate extent, they will develop from a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics, which is highly resistant to antibiotics and which spreads rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunctioning of the immune system in patients with weakened body weight, low body weight, or in patients over the years, it may cause serious hospital infections such as early infection or sepsis.
According to the Chief Medical Officer of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the disease agent is not investigated."
He resists antibiotics.
"We isolate these patients, the attending staff treats them in rubber gloves and mask and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined if they are present in their MRSA but this is not always possible to avoid infection.
Sampling is not in fashion
The majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable to preventing and spreading multi-resistant disease agents, Karolina Böröcz claims.
As this infection is well known in hospitals and homes for elderly people, hospitals receiving patients should be checked and MRSA carriers immediately isolated.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
This also involves the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases are thus revealed, if the patient suffers from an observable MRSA infection, said the mayor of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for treating individual infections, diseases.
There is a need to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or that microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but even hospitals do not comply in all cases.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the primary and outpatient treatment of patients, said Karolina Böröcz.
Save on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly disseminated to patients through medical personnel.
This is why hand washing and gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of domestic hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close together, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröcz pointed out, unfortunately, we can also see that hospitals that are in an unfavourable material situation are being spared on disinfectants, there are few nurses and patients, thus increasing the chances of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are followed, similar infections can be shown to be less or the further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has drawn up a programme for the prevention of MRSA, or a reduction in its occurrence.
The programme appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a declining trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks among its priorities the prevention of the emergence of multi-resisting disease agents (including MRSA) or hospital infections caused by these disease agents.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of Police Captain XXll, who caused a fatal accident, is complete.
It can be ruled out that the Police Captain of the XXII District, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotic substances, informed the spokesman of the Supreme Prosecutor of Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert's assessment of the case was completed.
The expert's report confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which had already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
On Tuesday, the then director of the Police Directorate of the XXII District hit Lajosa Kossutha in the XXII District by his own personal car in the turn of a 50-year-old man who entered before him when crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian was passing outside the zebra, after all, according to road traffic rules is not an attenuating circumstance, the diverting car must still give priority.)
After transport to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of these events, the district police director resigned from office and requested to be retired, according to a police report, because he was so shaken up by the case.
The case is under investigation by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with prosecutors in the investigation since the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks with a total value of EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest by the Minister for Finance János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects, the framework for which the parties had previously concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, and now the signed agreement concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement is also used for the budgetary financing of school-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose; the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which the budget will apply primarily to the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of the 4th metro route at the meeting.
The parties agree that once Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the funding of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astounding - the attention of the whole of Europe turns to a previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying on still the cheapest, but fast-moving EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re / Max.
Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seaside, is now undoubtedly the most sought-after Eastern European target for real estate purchases.
From the mountains are the most in the course of the area of Bansko, Borovc, Pamprovo and Vitosha, on the sea coast then Albena, Gold Sands, Sun Shore, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also searching for properties around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re / Max Bulgaria analysts, investors and the central part of the country - for example, Veleko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will be interested in buying more and more in the vicinity of the cheap city of Russia.
The capital of Sofia is also a promise of attractive possibilities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golf radiations, thus becoming next to the summer and winter season a sought-after destination even in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are already buying in bulk, for example around Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and more often also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, near the Black Sea, and many Russian customers are traditionally present in ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
The occupants buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or decrepit old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, the proximity of the big city, shops and, as a rule, the local doctor is important for them.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria was among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of an increase in value in the medium or long term.
Real estate prices in the capital are continuous, as demand is growing.
In Bulgaria, although the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are, over the last five years, they have grown by 21 percent per year.
The rise in real estate prices is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to information from the Minister for the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor's meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and, following the Wednesday's official opening, the international conference on the climate regime will continue after 2012 with ministerial negotiations.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which addresses the efforts following the period of emission reduction defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, they are being debated by the turbulent debate between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not now want to discuss accurate figures, although they are inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020, given the 1990 situation.
Another big question of the conference is whether developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also agree to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that depend on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member management board, probably under the UN's World Environment Programme (GEF) - we can read in Piac és Profit.
Hungarian six percent
The Minister for the Environment and Water Management, Gabor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help establish a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, independently of the success of the adoption of the "post-2012 agreement," and is prepared to commit up to a 30% reduction if other developed regions of the world or developed countries are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had a reduction target of 5.2%, with the 15 EU Member States committed to 8%.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which our country will do. - is mentioned in the press release by the Ministry of the Environment.
Bali is a big deal, because it is necessary to adopt an international agreement within two years on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would be postponed with certainty in 2012. In such a case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new emission reduction system, the necessity of which was also pointed out in its latest report by the United Nations International Scientific Council on Climate Change - IPCC, which is the carrier of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would result in a delay in emissions reduction and an inevitable increase in Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units publish video-sharing videos of events in Iraq and Afghanistan that popularize themselves.
First, YouTube liked British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, reported by the BBC.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have already been received on the Internet in this form, and more than 75,000 people have looked at their "channel."
The UK Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceadquarters" in spring 2007 and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the UK Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Peace in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployments in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original intention for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence they are also good at getting to know the general public with the real aim of the military's presence abroad.
"The promotion published in this form compared to traditional television recruitment advertising costs almost nothing," said the BBC Defence Expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it is necessary to have a political message, as it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made a game
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully modified, centered recordings, amateur videos, including the death of soldiers, also appear on the server: in a bit of hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers talk at most about losses, but they do not show a bloody form of combat.
After all, many videos have already been posted on the Internet from the fighting grounds in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a sharp deployment, but the British army has only just found out about them now.
The Americans are doing the recruitment a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can, through a more or less loyal simulation, get directly into the skin of the soldiers.
There's gonna be a Christmas at the ministries with raffle and pampers.
The Minister of Labour, Monika Lamperth, is probably not sentimental: instead of having a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to the pastries and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, somewhere else will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere with raffle and toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and the Swedish table - that's how the powerful have fun.
The state authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the Ministry of Defence will hold the most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration, but it does not expect its employees.
At Christmas, orphans will receive gifts from fallen soldiers, hosting family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions at Mission Christmas, but also holding a reception for journalists.
The resort pays 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will kick themselves out of the way compared to the other departments.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and of the six hundred employees of the Ministry are expected to have approximately 300 and 50 guests.
The resort will follow the Christmas tradition at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and raffle lots.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Lease of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than 400 invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas party: it will be organized by a tendro company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG) of EU money.
To this end, they rented the building of the Vigszionház Theatre.
MAG a. s. failed to confirm this information as we were unable to reach the relevant person.
There's no need for a suit.
The OIT building did not only host the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucia Ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
But OIT didn't want money from him using his halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party started with a healthy minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the [origo] portal at the prom were not compulsory evening dresses or suits.
The Puritan Party is set up by health, labour and local governments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and a celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth doesn't even officially invite her co-workers to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to press releases, will only receive coffee and pampers, so only 350 000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, where it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party she donates 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a toast.
Since János Veres is a minister, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party will, however, be missed, the official atmosphere is intensified not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Resort is holding a New Year's reception on January 20, the ministerial Christmas is not taking place.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the City Orchards and according to the Ministry's message, 1000 forints per person are available for 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the [origo] portal was communicated by the relevant press department.
The award of Christmas celebrations to the Department of the Environment in the Press Department could not be communicated.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Arts.
He's about to strike a giant strike.
The League Trade Unions Association, or the National Workers' Council Association (MOSZ) will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
On Saturday there will be a protest public assembly, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious disruption of transport, as rail transport will almost completely cease and workers of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League will meet with the National Workers' Council with details of the jointly organised Monday strike.
There will also be a strike committee called LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's event.
On Saturday there will be a protest public assembly, from Monday then the unions joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period unless an agreement has been reached with the government.
This means that the end date for the strike has not been set, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
Should Parliament fail to adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the legislation is voted on, strike commissions shall meet and decide on the next step.
According to the Monday agenda of Parliament, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will not be put to the vote until late evening or night.
Due to the start of the strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: work will be stopped on the railway for an indefinite period, part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of Volán's companies can stop in the morning.
At the same time, half of the road will also be closed in many places in the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil organisations, the list of which is kept up to date on the League website, have joined the call for strike.
Some organisations have announced an indefinite strike, others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while more and more people travel by rail at the beginning of Christmas holidays.
According to the current communication, the BKV will be on strike from the beginning of operation until 13: 00, from 7: 00 a.m. to 9: 00 a.m. at Budapest Airport, four-hour strike will be organised by the LIGA Workers' Union, to 2: 00 a.m. or 2-8-hour work stop, called for the Education Union and the Democratic Union.
The Hungarian Medical Union will strike alternately all over the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw the draft health insurance reform and present a new concept for public debate.
The second requirement is that the new method of counting pensions be introduced gradually from next year onwards.
Third, in the case of early retirement for the relevant fields of work, the possibility of being included in the system before 2010 is ensured.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Railway Workers' Union (VDSZSZ), which is under the League trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning the railway routes, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarország movement in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region in several respects.
The "risk warning 'developed by the company states that, in the context of the Hungarian Guard's activities, the greatest political risk is that" violent ethnic conflicts can occur in the short term by sharpening the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Roma population of Hungary'.
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to be aimed at provoking such an event - adds a research institute.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: "public debate on the Roma issue was left to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict."
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, reinforces extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the Institute is judging.
In addition, according to the Research Institute, the Hungarian Guard's work, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, "has largely ruined Hungary's image abroad, particularly in terms of the country's faith in stability and its democratic maturity."
The Institute recalls: a part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which since autumn 2006 have been getting more and more publicity and leadership, is that several organizations have been created in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which are themselves called "national militia" associations.
"A common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming - and also armed - their members' readiness to perform defence tasks (in the event of natural disasters, country attacks, disturbance of order), in addition to pointing out the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It also notes: this is all happening in a way that seeks to pack up all sorts of political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and parties to civil clothing.
Therefore, the emphasis on civil status and the form of the association is not merely to avoid the legal difficulties of the judicial registration, but is also a political strategy in the case of these groups.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-enhancing factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, with ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries calling for the creation of the Hungarian Guard to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this may affect the political stability of the region, "he adds.
According to the Research Institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As it writes, the Hungarian Guard's activities are similar, for example, to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the creation of which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard there are mass Roma riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to set up the Guard, with the aim of the organization being "national militia."
In the past 17 years, it said that "gypsy terror" existed in Bulgaria, but the state remained dormant and indifferent, resembling the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has triggered a stormy debate with the Bulgarian public.
As it further writes, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is signalled by the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they will create their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard's current activity shows similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own militia, we can read in the warnings of the risks developed by the Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, the research director of the Political Capital Institute, said at the inquiry by the Press Office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year and if they find anything that might affect the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays aren't open everywhere.
In Hungary, the days of leave are precisely laid down by law, and it has become a general practice that working days are being moved around the holidays, which we will expect less in the next year.
In the European Union and in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and national holidays and working days.
The days of work are usually linked to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate New Year's Eve: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is work leave - for New Year's Eve so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
In the course of the year, we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is 15th March celebrating the revolution of 1848 and 23rd October, the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrate the founding of the state, 1 May work, 1 and 2 November we remember deceased relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day holidays Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays are rarely for the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move a working day in cases where we only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that we remain in the workplace and school on the previous Saturdays.
When the day immediately preceding or following the holiday is worked out, it has been regulated by the Minister of Labour for many years in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
It does not, however, concern companies and institutions which are operating without interruption or with regard to their destination operating even on working days.
This year, the conditions of employment will be changed only around the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country will almost stop, because according to experience, most people will "make up" the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve or take advantage of the vacation they have saved.
In the next year, several of our holidays fall into the middle, or at the end of the week, so the shift of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the holiday work so that workers can stay home for four days straight.
On 26 April, Saturday will be a working day, so that Friday may be a day of rest on 2 May.
The next transfer is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, work will take place instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year, however, will be able to take place entirely in the name of the holidays, because from 24 December they will have almost 24-hour holidays, even though New Year's Eve is the center.
Six daunting little things to piss off your colleagues.
The e-mails that we forget to send, the voice messages that we will never receive, the innocent lies that we will almost never even notice again: all this "boosts" everyday days in the workplace.
The question is, will you get used to this little inconvenience, or will you put on gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry with, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague will tell you.
That you missed a meeting about it?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to give the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, a thing solved by one apology.
Before it comes to embarrassing apologies, it's good to think about what you could do to make your colleagues uncomfortable moments, and knowingly try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than when you reach out for a paper, office supplies, or your phone, and they're not there.
You remember putting a stapler on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on one of your colleagues' desks, which you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll be right to be mad at you for going through their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or adhesive paper out of your office, because it may be uncomfortable if you run out of early, and you will need them immediately.
Rumors about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop spreading gossip.
Who, who, what was he doing with?
Where and why?
Do not put your thoughts on everyone's nose about the private life of colleagues!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse their trust!
Lock what you've heard in yourself, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his affairs.
You're reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and appeal to a severe headache, you report your absence, because you're not well, or you think that you'd rather rest today, think that your work, the urgent tasks and the work that has a certain deadline, will have to be done for you by someone else.
Keep an eye on your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you have to stay at home, please report that your colleagues and managers will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Buzzing, giggling, telephoning
Did you dive into a job where you get grossly ripped out by a chirping colleague?
You accidentally witnessed a phone conversation that would be better off not hearing at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by grumbling, singing, loud talking (over their heads) or stomping, constant kneeling, loud discontent.
All this can be disturbing even when they are not currently being prevented from any project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you accusing others of making mistakes?
If something is not timely or you have forgotten to send an important letter or a message, do not accuse others of your oblivion.
Do not refer to the eventual chaos prevailing in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Admit it, if you've made mistakes and someone has paid for it, and correct the damage!
Ask how you could fix things, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Tracksuits and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not suitable for the office!
Don't wear leisure clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be negligent, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in a normal dress - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a person wants to comply, they stop being interesting.
Riding in the usual morning traffic.
A special tune will be heard from the radio: the sound of the violin to which electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes pace and bass is added to the previous tone colors, then a female choir is joined as a real jewel.
There's a song by Zagar called Wings of Love at the mr2 station.
For a long time, home music has not spoiled us with quality electronic pop.
All of a sudden, the traffic looks pretty different because you're listening to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, a few new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, slowly changes the overall picture, and although garage rock is once again in fashion with its guitar punching, even home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Five churches and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until eventually - perhaps because two pikes couldn't fit into one block - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The film Ference Török "Szezon").
Its formation, playing in the beginnings of smaller clubs, recognized a wider audience after the wan2 magazine included their first album from 2002 among the fifty most important home records and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only domestic players that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are, without a doubt, "on course," although of course no one asked if they were satisfied with this label.
The band reacted well: made a new, better album.
Now released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open up new paths for them, although the name itself is trying to create continuity with the initial flights in the Fives.
This is a verse from the composition of the old band Balázs Zságer.
The ethereal reference, flying would be in place, but alongside the ethereal breath of this music, has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, at the premiere of the album in Millenáris Park, the singer György Ligeti, who is currently working in England with The Puzzle.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Petőfi station, which has been playing popular music from morning to night, we started to have flattened melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's fine.
The portal hvgu interrogated Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how much does what you play remain marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of fringe music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different caste of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only be created because of sales, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can come from an honest inner need.
In this spirit, the position as adopted works, independently of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
It's not just teenagers and people in their 20s who go to concerts, but older people.
They look much more closely at the transformations of light music going on around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how many times does he listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it feels good that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In my country, music is not born for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more at concerts, where the mutual influence is already working, but it is only hidden in the imperceptible changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that when a person wants to accommodate an audience, they stop being interesting ever since.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's working solo, and he's built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of how they try to explain our music.
We're more of a team player who relies on each other's musical presence and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was impossible not to compare our work to the songs of Yonderboi, after all, several of us separated from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In toplista station mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love came first.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular way, did you knowingly open up to the wider layers?
B.Z.: We didn't plan on writing a hit to sell the record.
There's more to the song.
We thought of it as the album finale, by which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea to build this choir from soloists of a home music scene with a good voice.
That's how this six-member corps - Sena, Edina Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Yuci Németh - got together, which we then baptized into Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: Is that exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls make something out of it?
B.Zs.: The composition has long existed in the instrumental version, when the material on the board came together, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
The chords' chain seduced him to join the singing parties.
That night, I sang a tune on him that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course it needed wonders.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that vigorously.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing together and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't go with their singing.
They were also on the stage in the back.
On purpose?
B.Z.: The fact that they were in the back was only due to technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we did not want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where they belong, where they belong, and just letting those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born, the others felt it.
hvg.hu: What was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the composing of music, not even one of the heavier pieces actually occurred during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock 'n' Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work groove for long, then everything slowly found its place like in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is always changing by concert and by "I've already released the record."
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Sam.
A traitorous broker risked billions of dollars of insignificance.
A treacherous embezzler.
This marks his famous employee, Jerome Kerviel, a French banking giant Société Générale, owner of a domestic Commercial Bank.
It cost her almost EUR 5 billion.
More like Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues, and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all large banking houses, he recognized the US mortgage crisis in time.
"He's mentally weaker," it came from the mouths of his superiors, who sent the police after him.
But, as is apparent from Kerviel's statement by the French media, for example, Le Monde, he was a man who, at the end of last year, had profits of EUR 1.6 billion from his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or to those who have had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
But it should not have had an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he made the right bet.
At the end of the year, its profits then increased to up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, and adds that he certainly didn't keep anything to himself.
In his entire interrogation, he admits to falsifying records so that it wouldn't come up.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though Eurex was interested in his business.
The risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd be found out?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
In his position, he had to work his way up.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a single broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he'd never make as much as the others.
"At my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
For my education and also for professional and personal development, "Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after boarding came the first great success.
Allianz made a fortune in his shares, betting half a billion euros in London's bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses said they knew about everything, or rather suspected.
"As long as I was making money, they turned a blind eye."
But then the blow came at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After the mid-January weekend, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that it cost her five billion euros.
And how did they find out about him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who is not on vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone looking into his records, "Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to win 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately CZK 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will be going to traffic.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and firms to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Firms should finance the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, as well as for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is still among the least successful in the newly adopted countries.
20-year sentence for ex-president Nicaragua confirmed court
On Thursday, the Nicaragua Court of Appeal confirmed a 20-year sentence for the former President of Arnold Aleman, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near Nicaragua metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 goes back to prison, according to AP, it is not clear at the moment.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on prison officials to let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to accounts for foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Aleman founded to fund his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He went through last year with the support of ČSSD, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and CSSSD could not afford to not accept it.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote on government mistrust, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies has traditionally overlooked this, although the most influential, the law has calmly passed.
It's a certain paradox.
Every government starts and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government's power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more media-grateful, and that is why he pays much more attention to the media.
Politicians' arguments are far more interesting to the public than rough numbers.
The state budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered from three diseases which it is unable to solve at once for 2008:
The first is a high proportion of mandatory, so-called mandatorial expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" ČSSD and KSČM before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the disease of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of urban and municipal budgets.
But the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It's public and relatively under control.
But the time bomb is the deficit of urban and municipal budgets.
Many mayors, in addition to tax money, fees and loans from banks, often unwittingly issue bonds with which they overowed their city hall.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling the shares of energy and other distribution networks that they have received from the State in privatisation.
Now they don't have this source anymore.
If we follow only the official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, like the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting the CSDP.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state became increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan, or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our Republic.
It is a huge disgrace that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years, completely unnecessarily swelled into gigantic proportions.
Even if some of the senseless populist spending, approved this year before the elections, has been abolished, if there is not a shift in retirement and pension reform in the near future, then, in fact, any policy in this country will end, and whoever rules it will be mere administration.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that government politicians become officials, mechanically dividing most of the tax money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the exertion of normal expenditure by spending mandatorily.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the past governments did not manage what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want to see government officials become mere officials, then we must be patient and give this not-so-strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can in taxes and charges, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow a balanced state budget to be gradually achieved.

The banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
This will bring more than $100 billion into the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank is auctioning the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to the auction, making the European and Swiss central banks available another 24 billion.
This is the first time that national central banks have agreed to a coordinated action to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis following the attacks of the 11th September.
"This move is intended to address the economy's biggest difficulties, the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumoc, from the economic Outlook Group, wrote to his clients in his report.
"The coordinated central bank action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to 50%," said Baumol in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billion losses.
"Central banks must be really worried about what else might follow when they decided to do so," said the chief economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"The situation seems really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend credit to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with potential effects on economic growth throughout the world.
The central banks have thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about borrowing money from each other, even though the US, Canada, and Britain central banks reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that central bank action will contribute to ending the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is about to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has once again spoken about the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now come to an end at the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference made up of a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems," said Klaus.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject was very important to him and therefore so engaged to him.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter cartoons of my opinions."
So now the bidders can read his unbiased attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he has in his opinion enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess the professional treatise, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
He described as the main conclusions of the book that the climate is constantly changing, and so its changes are normal, that there is no consistent opinion of all scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He has repeatedly explained to the questions present that it is not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits."
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver's license didn't change 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue them a new ID by the end of the year.
But the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the road after the New Year without a valid licence.
According to the authorities, it wasn't just those who didn't want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in the interest of changing their driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis are swamped with applications and the interest in changing their licence has increased this week.
The Magistrate will check in about 2,000 clients a day.
We've got about half an hour in the queue.
In Prague, about 140.000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licence.
The issue of a new licence takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will pay more than 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the mandatory exchange of the licence by the end of the year and go on a road without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January onwards.
The guilty will pay at most 2,000 crowns.
But a police officer can also deal with a misdemeanor with an agreement.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will be increased to CZK 2500.
According to previous information, he could have been fined by City Hall and by a man who's not going anywhere.
In doing so, he was also able to pay 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum of a thousand crown fines.
According to the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karl Hanzelka, no one is in danger of ten thousand fines.
According to him, a driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not an ID that every person has to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
All you have to do is take it or send it by registered mail to the competent municipal office.
With the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with papers from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million other papers.
The court has reduced its punishments to detectives associated with Berdych.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konářík, who are accused of criminal conspiracy with David Berdych, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
The Prague Supreme Court decided on this definitively, which thus reduced their sentences by one year and two years.
Originally, the detectives of the Prague Department of Combating Organized Crime had been in danger for 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision cannot be appealed against, only the Supreme Court's appeal is possible.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but he is only waiting for a first-instance verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already been punished in sum over 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court acknowledged in particular 19 people guilty of the robbery, 16 of whom today were dealt with by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants have refused the prosecution since the beginning of the investigation, claiming it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, inter alia, were passing information to criminals from police sources, covering individual robberies and helping gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang turned in 30 percent for Opava and Konářík for it from the magnifying glass.
The indictment concerns the criminal activities of a gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious harm to their health, but also the abuse of the authority of a public official and the illicit use of arms.
The police discovered illegally held pistols, steel core missiles, laser sight or machine gun during house searches.
According to the charges, the gang has come to tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have finally recognised the guilty of other robberies of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men in the Berdych area are still on trial in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to trial.
The main trial has thus far been avoided by Thomas Pojeto and Maroš Šuleje, who are in Irish custody, awaiting final decisions regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Children's replacement bill: 12 million
In exchange for children in the maternity ward, Igor Veleba's malfunctioning family lawyer wants compensation of CZK 12 million, plus legal expenses.
For each mother of three million, for the father of two million and for the children of one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's lawyer Ondřej Dostál therefore does not agree with the proposal by Veleba.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," said he achieved after today's meeting.
"But in order to get an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has developed.
Let's see if it's worth anything.
However, we remain in the view that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all, "stressed the Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family wanted a million crowns for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb was used as a basis for negotiations for compensation by an expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motole.
The parents of children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, have suffered psychological harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced with remorse for not preventing the confusion of the newborn.
Women are having a hard time coping with the latest trauma and what's happening right now, he summarized the contents of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the obstetrics last December 9.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková in Příbyslavice and Veronica in Libor Brožová and Jaroslav Trojanova in Jablonov.
Hjtman Vysočina Miloš Pušl gave each of the families CZK 100,000 at the end of October to compensate for the expenses which they incurred by mistake of the Třebíč hospital, which the region established.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In case of errors, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may ask for assistance from the founder.
So far, the courts have given people relatively low compensation, the sums were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup has lost the Walash Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Walash Kingdom brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the Valachian king used for the first time, but the project was built by a long work team around Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actor.
Soup didn't take part in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably isn't over, and the client will appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabish and his team are parasitic in Bolek Souvka's popularity," said the Polívka lawyer after the trial.
According to him, everyone will recall actors and comedians in the words of the Walash Kingdom.
Harabish feels the same way.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
Looking for money and inventing events, "he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"Years later, they realized that the project was successful and he could get something out of it.
They want to parasite on our work, "he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the name Valachian King used Soup for the first time on his television show.
In 1993 it was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brbobohý.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Valachian passports.
The original recessionary event turned out to be a business and lucrative business activity, followed by Harabish establishing the Walash Kingdom.
In 1997 Soužka agreed to give his name and signature in passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also stated that Harabish merely took advantage of the bare idea that Souvka published in the action for his business plan.
"Boyslav Polívka's popularity of the Valaše Kingdom project certainly helped," said the judge.
She added, however, that Harabish and his team were the souls of the project, which was dedicated to him intensively.
The cooperation of the rival parties continued until 2000, when Harabish organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have started to accumulate between Polívka and Harabish, culminating in the demise of "King Byslav I elected for ever."
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken on by Harabish singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka brought an action against Harabish and his company, which the court rejected today.
Jasno could bring Harabish to the dispute about the race for the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and the deadline weren't ready to be revealed yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like riding kings in Slovakian.
The King should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Souvka can apply, "added Harabish.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudice
To tell you the truth, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the gear, the steering and also production could be described as some below average.
But the market is now the successor to Peugeot 207, and it's much better.
And the car called SW goes a little further, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I was testing a classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the space on the back of my head.
This is the end of the complaints, because the vehicle body means that even two-metre-long men will not suffer in this direction.
♪ Flying through the world ♪
I'm going to cross the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty good design, where I have a single complaint to the poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invasion here, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrest.
The side line has also improved significantly against model 206.
What in space, so here there is an increase in the dimensions of the body.
In the wagon, the already mentioned lack of space above the head disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
So the main thing on this car is his luggage.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (thanks to the tipping back window) and as well stored.
Deaf spots are equipped with restraint tyres, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't get in the way, it can be extended and it can hold heavier objects.
But let's pause over volume together.
According to the tables in the basic arrangement 428 l, which is rather the average value against the competition.
However, not against the Czech Republic's most sold car of this class - the damage of Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of Mladoboleslau product, then we find that Peugeot lags a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when the pram is loaded, this value is critical.
But if I were to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the flat floor after the backrest of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6 litre positive-ignition four-cylinder with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old is supposed to look like who drives a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low-energy, and it's pulling.
If I compare it to the damaging equivalent that sometimes acts like she's got a rag stuffed in the exhaust, I can only be thrilled with it.
The price list will indicate
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a September 14 hundred for 329900 CZK is still good.
Our aggregate costs CZK 410 900, which is quite enough.
The Premium tested equipment will then throw in the equipment for an additional CZK 80,000 on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper shutters, electrical control of rear windows...
It just costs everything 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the extra gear at Fabie's and you'll get a very similar number.
So there's no choice but to choose a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, children from Eastern European countries are growing, raising concerns about further development of local education among local residents.
In the meantime, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children are becoming violent.
The problem with the integration of Eastern European children in British schools illustrates the case in North Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are starting to escalate.
Arguing, bullying and fighting between pupils have also been brought into relations between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with an iron rod.
The guilty defend themselves against being insulted by the boy by racist insults.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls of the man were said to have had racist remarks and threw rocks at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to a bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he bent on us with apples and pears, and then exposed his ass, "she described another unpleasant episode for The Times, the mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local settlers even described disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrant countries is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain, who are headed here for work.
Around 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba The most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation may come true if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, as calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you can find it in a complete and even richer list.
But only on one island can you find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba used to be the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called her the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure depot that the Spaniards in America hijacked and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel grew up in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of America's mob bosses Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among them, among other things.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses grew up in Havana, and cars that belonged to the iconic symbols of the 1950s drove around the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a estate in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and in Cojar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in Bodeguita, Havana.
In the bar of the dear Nacional Hotel, they will mix you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And the cult cars from the '50s have been driving around Havana so far, because the once imported giblets and fiats in that salty and wet air have already rotted.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part of it, is decrepit, yet nowhere in the vicinity are as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are right there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, like Trinidad.
As tourism brings much needed money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the shores of Holguín province as well as on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pleasure, which is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by the train drivers.
The cane from the vast plantations was tied to sugar factories on narrow tracks by steam trains and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been restored for many decades, and so there are working machines, whose peers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba don't miss.
And so Varader, or Havana, doesn't need to be written down too much.
Perhaps just to remind you that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum and whoever likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Viñales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viñales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from limestone subsoil.
Mogotes, limestone homels and rocks rise sharply from the bottom of the valley and the fertile soil is caught in their sinuses, making the stale rocks covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet its final appearance if you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
Maybe someone finds it interesting that Major Zeman was doing the Chilean episode.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Fame and fortune brought him a slave-and-sugar trade.
Wealth has become the beauty and exposition of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that, in the 1950s, there was no road connecting that region to the rest of the country.
She isolated him to stay away.
Nothing was built there, which is why nothing was broken, everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the nearby area, such as Playa Ancón Beach, or the Sugar Vale.
In the evening it is to go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it quiets over the morning.
Baracoa
A small town in the very east of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful on the island.
Surely such an opinion is already affecting the road itself.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo have to cross high and arched mountains and go through nature, which human activity has almost nothing to do with.
The eastern outpost of Cuba has put UNESCO on the World Heritage List thanks to its intact nature.
They make the best chocolate in the church, they have the Columbus Cross (in fact it originated about a hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and down the hill, where the former castle and today's hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
The coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions who are the descendants of former slaves, many pages could describe all of this.
But, as they say, better to see once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans say
Few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment are affected by the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, with representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and the coordination of allies today.
While the United States, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates this week, has called for NATO troops to be more active, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and strengthening development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to enable the people to start further economic and security development themselves, "said British Defence Minister Des Browne to the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgents' activity, according to US military figures, is the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, even by 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have roughly 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in southern territory.
But according to the United States, the allies have reached the limit of organization and equipment.
Specifically, they're asking for more helicopters, soldiers, and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific objectives for the next time and the ways to achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar sense, NATO's Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke today.
"I'm not happy about what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90% of the soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that is little, "Reuters De Hoop said to Reuters De Hoop at the end of three days' talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
There have also been disputes among the participating countries over recent months as to whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans have quite a number of representation in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands on them are not as high as those on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country, "said Gates.
This week, the British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan deadbeat exposed: Germans play while our boys fight," wrote Sun in the material, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went into counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby game in the south of Afghanistan.
The government debt will swing to a trillion in 2009
For each Czech Republic there is over 84.000 crowns of government debt.
The total debt increased to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better developments in the state budget management.
The government debt of the Czech Republic increased to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on government debt from early October.
For each Czech Republic there is a debt of over 84.000 crowns.
Over the last year, the state owed more than CZK 111 billion.
"For the time being, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could not cross the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns, "said the analyst Patria Finance David Marek for the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, the analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikora sees this: "We could reach a trillion in 2009 to exceed one trillion.
Exactly when it will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were to turn out to be different, politicians would be willing to save more, it could shift to 2010.
But I do not expect this change, "he said.
Debt increases
State debt consists of central government debt and is mainly due to the accumulation of government budget deficits.
State debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has increased by CZK 38,5 billion this year to CZK 719.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year.
The so-called marketable state debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and decreased by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13% year-on-year for the first quarter to the third quarter, which is really a lot to see how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is wrong that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with when pension reform is here, "commented Pikora's data.
Better than expected
It follows from the 2007 State Debt Finance and Management Strategy that the government was planning to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better developments in the state budget management.
The amount is mainly the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It also includes the planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidation agency CZK 13.3 billion, the ten billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear today in Khartoum for giving her name to a teddy bear
On Thursday evening, a British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by one of the Khartoum Tribunal and expelled, as her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of having six to seven-year-old pupils named Muhammad to a teddy bear despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with a whip wound.
This British 47-year-old teacher, working at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested in her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
"Eight names will come out of the mouths of the children, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," Robert Boulos, the principal of the school.
After a vote in the class, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a teddy bear accompanied by a label: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with that name on it, but the problem is the self-depiction of a prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' fellow Muslims, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knows it well and that he would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I regret only asking children to vote for a name," he said, "innocent misconduct."
This is also shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "they never speak of religion in class."
Let us remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most often given first name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, represents a way to honor the prophet (often awarded to the firstborn).
However, what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them to a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and last round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on status," said European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake," and appealed to Belgrade and Prishina to honour their obligations to keep peace and to be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on December 10th.
The negotiators of the Troika, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be going to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90% are Albanian-speaking populations, could appear in a clearer light as of 10 December, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
Interviews in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, entrusted the Troika with new negotiations.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be completed on 10 December.
On the other hand, Russians who had previously blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the UN Security Council insist that the negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Charchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community governance, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina states that if the Security Council does not decide on its behalf, it is prepared to declare its independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on widespread autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," the President of the Kosovo Authority Fatmir Sejdia announced in the Baden hotel where this "last chance meeting" took place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of Kosovo's Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murder and deportation '.
"Domino Effect"
Serbia's President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still an option and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "domino effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the independence wars in the 1990's.
"But it does not mean that to Serbia," he said, "the compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong solely to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had the right to veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council. "
He replied to Fatmir Sedjiu's journalists that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status," and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence had occurred from Albanian-speaking citizens, it would have been "agreed" with the West.
Bush made a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians.
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, convened at his behest, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate opening of negotiations with the intention of resolving once and for all a 60-year dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must destroy the "terrorist infrastructures," and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, declared Bush and recalled the obligations that both sides derive from the "roadmap" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House Chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, are aimed at "concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all issues that have not yet been decided without exception, including central issues."
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled in the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US President, stressing that the subsequent negotiations would be "comprehensive and thorough" and that it would affect all aspects of the solution, with mention being made of 'Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others'.
Then Olmert spoke on the stand, who expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous' and that it should be" made to be concluded during 2008 '.
Bush identified the end of 2008 as the deadline for the realisation of his "vision of two states," Palestinian and Israeli, which exist side by side.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had accepted a commitment from Bush to this effect before it decided to take part in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offer peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is fighting the root of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saud in an interview which he has provided to one Arab-speaking journal backed by Saudi capital.
According to the DA, the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with these little messages from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what people say.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the General Inspection of the French State Police (Inspection Générale de la Police Nationale (IGPN)), the police car passed shortly after 17: 00 on Sunday Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but was on patrol and passed 40 to 50 km / h without the side lights on," explains the police source.
The green motorcycle brand Kawasaki, "unregistered and therefore without the permission to drive on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, passed through "very high speed."
"The motorcycle crashed into the police car on the left side after not giving priority to the right," said one officer.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew came back negative.
The condition of the car (punctured front, shattered windshield, broken bumper) is indicative of impact intensity.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise), Marie-Thérès de Givry, responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "acts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons at risk," which was also taken over by the division départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Regional Police Directorate Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN-led investigation excluded, at this stage, police liability for the accident.
The three witnesses who were interviewed on Sunday evening confirmed "a version of the police, namely that the mini-motorcycle approached them quite quickly from the left."
A groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the klipsen on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
There was an autopsy on both victims' bodies yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, word spread rapidly that police officers were to leave the scene quickly without giving the two young men first aid.
IGPN should, with all caution, also rule out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"It is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more searching and with which to be very careful," said the police source.
The diary "Libération" met with the eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads right to where the accident took place.
"Immediately, my cousin and I, who is a nurse in the hospital, ran down to try and resurrect them," this witness tells us.
There was nothing we could do. "
Then he saw a "flabbergasted, completely terrified cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth spoke on the phone. "
In the face of a rapidly growing tension and the certainty that young people are in a hopeless situation, police officers have been taken by the car of colleagues who have arrived in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the cops left."
They also did a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities have not come to the aid of the young.
These young men were given first aid.
The fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them, "the prosecutor pointed out.
Tension in Pakistan is growing
On Monday, Pakistan's police suppressed the first demonstration since the announcement of a state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under exceptional circumstances, tear gas grenades were injured, which, according to witnesses, used order forces.
The last of them responded to the stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been subpoenaed.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were covered by roadblocks on Monday morning in order to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers received the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "encouraged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency, and garbage to those who took an oath before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise does not apply."
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election that took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," said the official in The News.
The promise of Parviz Musharraf to renounce the leadership of the army and become a civilian president, "does not apply" after the introduction of the state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Otherwise, Pakistan's government has also refuted speculation in a country that continues, according to which the Deputy Chief of the Army was to order President Musharraf under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy still constitutes an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as poorly planned or found in an unexpected way.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected today, revealing a study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études demonographiques (Ined) - State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as poorly planned or found in an unexpected way.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilisation, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, estimated by Ined.
The regulation of contraception allowed for better "fertility control," the Institute argues, and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age has now reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
One pair of five have even been calculated for a month precisely and preferably in spring, which is considered the most pleasant period of the year for the birth of the child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work was needed by astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to a remarkable repair of the torn solar panel, necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky climb into space that collected records in terms of duration, distance from the housing modules, speed with which it was planned, and the measure of "cutilism" that the astronauts spent on repair.
Trouble occurred on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see Box).
This module is a sort of landing dock for modules-laboratories.
These, however, need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the 17-and-a-half-ton power-generating module using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, so that it was anchored at its final station.
After she moved it, the crew began to decompose the 60-meter solar module panels.
And in that, one of the panels, decomposing like a drawing harmonica, as a result of a cable clenching, was damaged on an area of nearly one meter.
The decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally supposed to perform a control output on the Discovery ship and then go to fix another solar panel whose rotation system was malfunctioning were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the station's shoulder, and made repairs.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" of the American Aviation and Space Authority (NASA).
Tall, stout, very skillful, has a very well-worked chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed some "splints" to damaged sites.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained close to the airlock, and also from the inside, the other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, namely a mini stick coated with an insulating device to prevent electroshock on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "produced" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely decomposed and then infiltrated his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day's rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are clearly losing on the Paris Stock Exchange, after this airline operating in the aviation and defence industries announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion to face the A400M delay.
The EADS have lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to reassess its expected production results for 2007 due to delays due to slow forward progress of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the start-up flight.
The price of reducing the delay in the delivery of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was "EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus," announced the parent undertaking of the European constructor EADS.
Because of these costs, the EADS, next Thursday, will be forced to report a new profit outlook before interest and taxes (EBIT) are deducted.
The group also indicated that the new cost estimate corresponded to a six-month delay.
Let us remember that the EADS 'production results fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay in another programme, namely the A380 giant aircraft.
Originally, the group assumed to provide the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without tense expectations: the Russians will majority the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming that, after the end of the very little free election campaign, my commitment to stability, and to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the election to the House of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a pre-recorded television message to voters at public service stations, but its content is kept secret.
It does so from the position of leader of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which seems to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received the ambassador of foreign states yesterday, the president let nothing out of him and settled for another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish for honest, as transparent and most open elections as possible, elections without the slightest defect in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, that is far from it.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennadi Zjuganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, not even for Yeltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion at the Garry Kasparov Chess, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, she continues to be banned from visiting, according to her lawyer.
"The Russians remained the mentality of homo sovitica"
In the wake of these parliamentary elections, simple, tense expectations, there are two more open questions:
- "Who will become Putin's successor in the presidency?
Yesterday, the Official Gazette published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates may present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
But there is no follower.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party of United Russia, who will choose the government and the president?
One way or another, the outgoing ruling power will prevail on the whole of the parliamentary line, as will the presidential election.
It's tradition.
"Russia's mentality remains homo sovitica, does not feel to be master of its fate," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Sankt-Peterburg notes a more distant context: civil society has gained, a country that has been Christian for five centuries after Europe, a delay; the famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed up on a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism did not follow terror but some economic well-being," thinks Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are now "voluntarily giving up their personal responsibility," which was demonstrated shortly after the break-up of the USSR.
"What's to think about?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian leaders) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
The new freedoms taken from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Čerednichenko, a 45-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them? "
Loaded memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are opening up to the public.
The 47 million archive documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were only accessible for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his authorised persons.
Eleven states in charge of managing archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratifying this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable us to explore "particularly the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were against making these nominal documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What is supposed to be homosexuality or mental disability of some of the victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or warrants drawn up by the Gestapo were collected after the war for practical purposes to find deported or forced work by civilians, to bring them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are dealing with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these papers," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India amounts to almost EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, representing 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expecting a free trade treaty to be signed in 2008, as European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU Foreign Ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (agreements de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already close to EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, representing 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India, according to the European Commission, is the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is hugely doping both economies," and "India will gain better access to the market for 450 million prosperous Europeans," demonstrated by Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner has specified. The Asian and European giant will exchange "EUR 47 billion in goods" and "EUR 10 billion in services," stated Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential." The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction.
On Thursday, the Bank of England made it clear that it intends to alleviate the current concerns that credit market conditions will deteriorate again and announced a bid of £10 billion in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that has been valid for an unusually long time.
"In order to ease the concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater confidence in the way in which to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation ', announced in a communiqué.
The bank states that £10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the financial market in this way on December 6 at GMT at 12.15 until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
This seems to be the first time that BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that "it remains ready to take further measures to keep interest rates" on interbank loans at the same level with its base rate.
The interim interbank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6,6%, the highest number since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the fee rates that have deterred banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to opt for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank at lower rates and with greater discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for the People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Center) refuse to deal with Socialists' proposals on purchasing capacity (PS)
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the various paragraphs of the socialist bill on purchasing capacity, which equals rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law came on the agenda within the so-called socialist "nest" (meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted by the PS Presidency on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the renewal of the fluctuating TIPP, a transport check or rent regulation.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity to exchange views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television performance on purchasing power.
The head of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would re-submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act, which will be discussed by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculation that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter / producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the Republic of British organizer Melvin Benn, announced it.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," revealed Charlie Jones from the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in the state of New Jersey is a summer campsite destination.
The festival should take place from August 8th to 10th at a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took over the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80 000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licenses and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvina Benna are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were dealing with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current leadership of the city, we have become bogged down in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we have had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to start a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago Grant Park in 2005, after they excelled at the festival scene in 2002 by organising Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9,8M and $11,3M.
Both festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European Model Melvin Benna Festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in green areas in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine both concepts in a certain way so as to create both the impression of a rural festival by Europe and the urban by America. "
Wineland is located roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The village of Vineland, including the mayor, is thrilled to support the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last nominee refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he claims "that they are sufficiently advantageous to allow investment in such an event and welcome the festival, which will hopefully have a long duration."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent out to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed yet when the program is only released to the press.
"Vineland will have a rock voice, but the music will be varied to attract a wide range of spectators," says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter in the senior year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself stands up against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegates' tasks.
But his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fall into "Governor" 's claws?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry who decides where he's going.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favourable, he'll go there.
Our task is to offer those whom they will regard as the best, "he said.
Hunting for festivals
For the moment, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is to promote a local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all the festivals of the West Coast, whether they are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be to present the Québec films, draw attention to them and ensure that directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had good publicity for the 30th year of the Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
In January he will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
this month also Québec introduced four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experts have divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks left until the end of the administrative year, and investors already take my hands off of me expecting a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure it will happen.
Banif considers that "from a statistical point of view, December has a positive trend on the stock market '.
However, it is not appropriate to create predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context, markets offer some doubts, at least in the short term, '.
These experts do not expect the stock market to move in the last weeks of the year, and state that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the lack of safeguards alternatives, especially the fixed income influenced by the effect of turnover to high-quality securities, both in long and short sections."
They therefore believe that the stock market will have a rather peaceful course, not without volatility, "mainly because the impact of the likely fall in FEDs (Federal Reserve) rates is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of stimulus to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the time for a bold statement that a marathon will happen.
"There are not too many reasons to be happy," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed to 15 945.7 points.
Yet all experts don't have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio regrouping and traditional supplementary pension contributions that occur every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, because he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December, after an extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The said analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, the analyst of Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels, and "we could therefore observe the index reflection caused by reports from the US on the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles to bring Ibex to the new maximum cores.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is the season for strong titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
By contrast, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it occurs.
"ACS has been regaining position for several months, and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology will also do very well, even if it is not very represented on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been in two cases a month of sinks.
A real marathon took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of a technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We will see whether 2007 will be the fifth year of profit (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will succeed in having its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operating under the "Popular Max" brand are a major change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish operators, as it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening times of its branches up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group which also made several assurances that it wanted to extend the opening times of its branches, has not yet decided on this.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to cancel the opening time of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening time by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience by Popular Bank will be crucial for other actors to join this initiative, which supports business opening times, or not.
This is precisely the objective of the project set out by Popular Bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as this is not about opening up new branches, but only about adjusting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernise its branches, which it already has in commercial zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
This complements the extension of the opening time with another concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colours.
The commercial manager of Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a greater recruitment of staff, as it moves from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angela Rivera explains.
The branches were selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Bank Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specializing in immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also has a very long opening time and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', Rivera says.
They just made a deal with Telephonic to sell cell phones through external personnel.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock market doubled the value of its rival Anteny 3
We did it '.
With this sentence yesterday, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trade when he stated that the television he was running doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I regret was that it did not happen because we grew more, but because we fell less', he said.
And he pointed out that because of the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco stopped trading yesterday by a 2.54% shift.
This profit has shifted their loss over the past part of the year to 15,66%.
The exchange value of this Mediaset-controlled company (with 52% capital) with Vocenta's participation (another 13%) thus amounts to EUR 4 488,88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and fell by 40.5% overall since January, has been worth half of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3,571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518,53 million in Pisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion in Vocento.
According to Vasile, a comparison with Antena 3 is offered because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what cost and how we will assess it in the ratings'.
Last week, Telecinco announced that this year, by overcoming billions of gross advertising revenues, it would become the first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, Executive Chairman of Telecinco and Publaespaña, a branch that provides advertising to the group.
If the forecast data had actually been achieved, this television channel would have seen an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (reaching 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on is the increased pay out of the best relative development in the Telecinco Stock Exchange, which has been preserved so far: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after buying up 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at these times.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates of Telecinco, 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected growth in income from 0,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009 has stopped.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antena 3, 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles mainly on the basis of increased dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates better Telecinco (accumulate) than Antena 3 (keep) because of its' numerous advantages' and growth of trade.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to overestimate them as they face 'similar threats' (oversaturated market and deteriorated economic environment).
Congress has approved the transposition of MiFID in force since November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today by the vote of Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government submitted a public hearing to a regulation that is developing a new law in order for both of them to enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party have consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and the detailed regulation of the activities of operators needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory bodies of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial consultancy services to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS) companies, financial consultancy companies (AFI) which join securities companies, securities intermediation agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of operations in financial instruments is extended by joining regulated secondary markets with multilateral trading and internalisation systems to compete with current stock brokers.
The Act also obliges firms providing investment services to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and methods of dealing with risk, and requires a statement of all operations undertaken to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the negotiations with the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, which excelled in making securitised claims considered a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the US with high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to set out the legal functions that the Bachelors in Economics and Corporate Management may hold for 30 years after the Royal Decree, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists, was approved in 1977.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and customer acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data at a time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is merely indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure, which will come to light on 14 December of this year.
"The ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level'
The second Prime Minister and the Minister for Economic Affairs, Pedro Solbes, stated that the November increase of the ISC to 4.1% was a "temporary number," but at the same time predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively "high" in the coming months.
In any event, Solbes stated in Congress' kuloirs that "even if it is not a favourable figure," Spain's inflation differential towards the monetary union has been "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," said the Minister for Economic Affairs on the data submitted today.
Virgin plans to make EUR 42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since the Northern Rock Bank went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (EUR 16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually declined over a period of two and a half months by mistrust of clients, despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for this money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity's name with its brand name, Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of the income invested in the British banks over the next three years, so that it can get the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
Richard Branson's group, known in the United Kingdom by its conspicuous advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to reach its resolution.
This week, the Northern Rock Bank marked the offer of the Virgin consortium, which consists of three other companies, as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
Today, in the early hours of the morning, the Civil Guard apprehended the current mayor of the Murcian city of Totana (from the People's Party) because of his alleged involvement in the corruption practices in the construction that were revealed this week.
Also, one of the City Hall's secretaries and the chief of local police have been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, a contemporary human MEP in May this year, and until then the mayor of the village, who, according to the investigative sources addressed by Cadena SER, could be the head of the entire business.
The police continue to monitor city hall buildings and construction commissions, and there are no further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the prime suspect in the corruption practices of construction, was accused of being discovered earlier this week.
As Caden SER, the lawyer of the 'humanitarian' Member of Juan Morales, who was examined yesterday, was arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to the investigative sources, Morales's alleged collection of commissions for his signature of the construction agreement with the Galician construction company, which was requalified for 200 hectares of land, is the subject of an investigation.
At the moment, eight people are being detained.
Bono accepted the offer of the state leading the Toledo PSOE candidate and, if they win, preside over Congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) in Toledo in the next general election and, if the Socialists win the general election, became President of Congress.
This was announced at the press conference by the PSOE Secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place today at noon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The executive chief justified the offer to the former minister by "it's important in political life to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He also noted that 'yes, it seems' that this politician from La Mancha will be a candidate for the Socialist Party for the President of Congress if the Socialists win in the next election.
Bono, as president of Congress, would replace Manuel Marino, who published his decision on 15 November not to run in the next general election and to abandon his active political career in order to pursue the fight against climate change within university education.
The former Minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly urged him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He also stated that, like citizens, they know who the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs will be if PSOE wins the election, and his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will preside over Congress.
If Bono gets this position, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not a swear or screaming" and to "become more and more like the citizens."
"Sometimes, unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where there is no peace and quiet talk is Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
Likewise, he spoke commendable words to the current President Manuel Marin and "his good work" and did not yet want to imagine himself in his place, so as he stated what his opponents might consider "great."
Climate propaganda
As the movement against climate change undergoes merciless persecution, both those who look sceptically at its predictions and those who prefer other political and social battles must show solid cohesion.
Moreover, to have a leader of a movement that is Prime Minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's actions or inaction have made a significant contribution to Spain's failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening and why its government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take in order to slow down climate change.
Which firms will be damaged, which population habits will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But we didn't get any explanations like that, and we won't.
Just because you have to sacrifice yourself and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of petrol, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of elections that he rushed to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords that lack any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And treaties with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who do not even speak, accuses, demands nothing, but is an ornament for meetings and makes tenderness.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractor and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and chief of local police of Totana arrested on suspicion of corruption practices in construction
As they informed the investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the city of Totana, the "People's Party" of José Martínez Andrea, the chief of local police, the secretary of the City Hall and one hospitality entrepreneur, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the city hall, in whose premises he is now located together with a number of police officers, who also came to the Commission for Construction and the Municipal Company for the Management of Industrial Property and Housing.
These three arrests added to the six that occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation linked to the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to land suitable for the installation, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 houses there.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged with a brief trial in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
The six first arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana is under investigation and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
In addition, his ex-wife, the owner of the real estate agency, registered today in Totana, and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the Autonomous Region, was charged.
Manuel N. A., Director and Owner of Nuaria Group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., Director of Suelo de Inmonuar, a member of that group, through which bribes were passed.
The investigation is carried out by a civil guard task force, whose members, in addition to being arrested, have also carried out 11 inspections, mostly in firms related to arrests, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevedre, Las Rozas (Madrid Province) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of a very well-known owner of a poultry meat product company that could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the construction of the largest residential complex in the city of Totana, Murcia, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa."
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the settlement of a village with 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are engaged in real estate market support, Conycase, which controls parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which is engaged in direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
That's what happens.

If you don't mind, we'll put the Book aside for months, and maybe we'll get attacked by other awards and competitions in the meantime.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18, the same day that Blackburn's book was also criticized by coincidence:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his notes the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the school councilman responsible for the subject of philosophy, requested on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical position on Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory basic philosophy course in secondary schools. "

One colleague informs of the introduction of an internet download offence into the Criminal Code:
A. Withdrawal of one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you dispose of less than EUR 400 in a record store, this is considered a mere offence (§ 623.1).
B. If you lose up to EUR 1 000 in the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (§ 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than shift compacts.
To participate in a riot has a rate of between three months and one year (§ 154 of the Penal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate of between six months and two years
(§ 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious in accordance with Section 184.2 of the Penal Code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. The unauthorised distribution of copyright-protected films is more punishable than the provision of pornographic material to minors (§ 186).
So unless my colleague is wrong, someone's arm has gone missing, and it's a big one.

My attending doctor is sticking me with one of his articles on strange research called "Money Causes Brain Activation, especially if others get less."
Or, for that matter, the feelings that the monthly staff pay makes depend on how much they earn.
Research was conducted at Bonn University using magnetic resonances on the tomography and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the head of the Life & Brain Institute Neurocogs Group in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, activation was mild, but when one got double, activation was higher.
I really don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
applicant of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been harshly pursuing the Balkan war criminals from the Court of Justice State Prosecutor's Office in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladič and former Bosnian Serbs leader Radovan Karajic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which the name of the documentary film of the Swiss director Marcel Schüppach "Karlin list" (2006, in Spain), which, at the pace of the detective thriller, follows the work of the Swiss applicant in the persecution of refugees and pressure on the relevant states to pull the net from Belgrade to New York.
What insurance is suitable for me?
The insurance of a car which protects the driver in the event of an accident is a significant expense, depending on different factors such as age, condition, sex, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to choose suitable car insurance than to choose a model car.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
The insurance of a car is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance company.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insurance premium of a certain amount for taking charge of the claims in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of licence holding, type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the premium rate.
For this reason, both persons over 25 and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies concluded that married persons have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of journeys and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The increase in the rate of rides increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of insurance premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best fits his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for the selection of one or the other type of insurance, which, in addition to complying with the type of insured person, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 face various disadvantages such as lack of experience in driving and short possession of a driving licence when they want to negotiate insurance premiums at an affordable price.
Although ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks at a discount in order to obtain insurance cover for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the client's involvement in the payment of the insurance claim.
"The part of the premium payment provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the premium, which would be the lower of the participation ', explains Luis Noguera, the main head of First Europe in Spain, the Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants in the operation by ensuring that the client is insured against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you're under 25, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance premiums in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the other hand, the malus is an increase in that basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it would be able to afford to raise the bonus, "explains Noguera.
After crossing the 25-year limit, drivers get easier when they go to arrange insurance, because the client's risk index decreases because of experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people are usually unable to make use of the experience acquired in advance when an accident occurs and even when driving," the director of a European company in Spain assures, and adds that most accidents occur in the second year of the procedure, when the "fear of a newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has no children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if the economic situation permits.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the clients with the lowest risk index and thus their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks at a discount (which could be EUR 300) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other traffic participants, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford luxury to get the highest discount," says Luis Noguer.
Retirement insurance against all risks at a discount of EUR 150 is recommended, or insurance extended to other participants in the operation, provided that a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a valid reason to study the insurance options that would suit us most in the face of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to the AC Milan point that means the eight finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, because for the Italians it would be the first and for the Scots it would decide to place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured a tie in the fifth game in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure that the Chachtjor does not get ahead of him with six points to play with Benfika, which has four.
These two D-group games will be played a week before the sixth round is over, because AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the 13th will start in the semi-finals for the first time, in an effort to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others, and the indecisive outcome at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, even if both teams try to compete for victory, because the Italians won't want to strategize on home soil, and Celtic knows that after winning, he'd be the first to get a better spot in the eight-finals.
Even a loss could be enough for Gordon Strachan's men if he doesn't win, but he can't count on it, because with the same nine points, Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2: 1) will pass, but they won in the first straight game (2: 0).
And so AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening for the Scots, who believe that they will reach the semi-finals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same match in the last game with the Kaka goal in overtime (1: 0) after the 0: 0 state in the base game time.
Hoping to win the "rossoneri" will be the Chachtjor for whom it is worth winning only if Celtic loses, both for advancing to the eight-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although last and unable to continue the highest European competition, could win a third place with one victory, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls Group started its first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20,000 spectators since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they opened their concert at GM Place in Vancouver, declared that their group's reunion was "great."
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present at the concert, which also included a video that depicts the history of this group, which triggered a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour takes place at the same time as the new album released by the EMI in Spain is released and brings a selection of their main successful songs as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo."
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice," British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, even though nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before Victoria Beckham started the show, she said that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she thinks about the show."
"Sporty Spice," whose exit from the group in 1998 "due to the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness in meeting journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw the world's public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I decided, "Chisholm said about the reconnection of a group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that, over time, "things have settled and we all love each other very much."
But a lot of things have changed since the last time the Spice Girls performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver with the Virgin Airlines special.
They were expected at the airport by an army of nannies.
Five has seven children in total.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He will be performing in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns about a new gas fight between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute over gas prices between Russia and Ukraine, thus increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
The majority of Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is driven by a pipeline through Ukraine, and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine's gas prices, it would charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas he receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said Reuters Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinach.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees (to Western Europe) via Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a devastating fall in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large part of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The inspector said that the Scottish chambers of the NHS must improve the checks on criminal records of non-European employees.
A recommendation came from the president of Robert Black's Supreme Audit Office after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the number of foreign personnel he employs.
But his report pointed out that the other key controls were in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel acquired from outside the European Economic Area immediately after the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
27-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone drove Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who showed up at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge charged with connecting with attempts at bombing in the UK.
The NHS chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Dislosure Scotland to check criminal records, this agency has no power to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office states, among other recommendations, that the commissions should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which help employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not regularly carried out," she reported the report.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS is much in line with its own pre-employment clearance policy, but he also added: "Our report draws attention to areas in which the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the number of foreign personnel."
President of BMA Scotland, Dr Peter Terry, said that it was "highly unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what other value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, a large majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably also be higher because the commissions had difficulty identifying the staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the control procedures in place at the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policy and directives of pre-employment controls for foreign NHS workers.
Minister of Health, Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the Health Commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best practices appear in the updated directives on pre-employment checks of all staff - including foreign ones - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division took over the movie awards
Control, a biography film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for the best movie.
The awards were also won by the star Sam Riley, who worked up to the role of Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was appointed the best actress for the thriller of the scandal.
And the Bond Star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the world stage.
The awards were ceremoniously handed over at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' path to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - only cost £3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the U2 Joshua Tree album, two awards - for the best director and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - for the film by Julien Temple about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentary.
The best actor's badge was awarded to Viggo Mortensen as the driver of the Russian mob boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Promised.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation built on the roles of tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for the extraordinary contribution of a British film.
This 50-year-old, whose films include, for example, Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of his time, I'm very honored. "
The independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury, in which film producers, actors and festival organizers sit.
The supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 people for a terrorist conspiracy.
Yesterday, Saudi Arabia announced that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities, as well as on the spiritual and security forces.
State television told the largest oil exporter that one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, the United States' allies, since 2003, since the invasion of Iraq.
The news report announced that a cell of eight militants led by a stranger was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid response force of 35 000 members to defend the device since the failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrested were one of the cells led by a "missile launch expert" that slipped into the country.
She also stated that militants were planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security personnel.
The government urged the clerics to try more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Shia government supported by the US, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - supported by the challenges of al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - have focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," said the State TV internal spokesperson of the Ministry.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested, aimed at promoting "Takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which fosters violence against Muslims called infidels and renegades.
Among the arrests were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate of Venus is perhaps a view of the future of the Earth.
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
The data from an orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more similar to the wilful twin Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour to Earth.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit along similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could be habitable.
But the fueled greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower rate of rotation sent Venus along a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead, and it's ravaged by storms and hurricane winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a modest insight into how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Oxford University of Physics Department and one of the heads of the Venus Express mission said, "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus began just like the Earth, perhaps even with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police have apprehended "enriched uranium."
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
The police spokesman said that three people were detained and the material was examined.
He didn't confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480 000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it's not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and passed them on to the candidates.
None of the questions on Wednesday, 28 November were as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate of the other side on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the Republican Party's status towards the election next year.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the most powerful Republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the disc when they heard something gratifying: the announcer recorded the peak of consent when candidates talked about hard access at the border.
The hardest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the prime national candidate, and Mr Romney, who had been pushed forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who was soft on illegal immigrants as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
These two were particularly fierce when the interviewers asked if one of the candidates would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants a normal position and citizenship).
The other candidates, like Duncan Hunter, the California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, the congressman from Colorado, were able to throw their little bit in the mill on the subject.
None of these two have a chance of being nominated, but they both stay in the game for perhaps starting to sound an alarm about immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least the candidates have the same opinion about immigration: greater rigour at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the conflict between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether simulated heating technology should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr Giuliani, through it, has stumbled to the conclusion that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another interviewer asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the recent Iowa survey due to his long-term Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, thus earning himself a laugh.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent successes in raising money and Ron Paul's loud cheer in Wednesday's debate.
These two have bounced from the bottom because both sides still cannot agree on more famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and persuasive with the winning news of American size on the lips, winking at both sides.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labourist pain
Gordon Brown once again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
There seems to be no orders sold, no bills in the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extra-marital fingers were sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have done without being discovered that some wealthy businessman for four years had masked contributions to the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not influenced by polls, there was hope that it would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly witty representative of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once feared Mr Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock's troubled bank has shown weaknesses in driving and poor judgment under fire.
Incorrectly thought-out proposals to change the tax code brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative misconduct.
The three retired generals started a revolt in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that part-time work was to be the commander of the armed forces.
Now there are multiple-edged gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of Labour (and their former internal discipline guard), has resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is moving irrevocably towards his end.
Even so, governments can reach the tipping point behind which they find governance difficult.
The people don't trust politicians, and they don't like them, but they usually push away their distrust when the new crew takes over.
Now that it seems clear that some prime minister probably won't improve anything, and he may not be in office for long, this is a push-away: the government is becoming leaky, the ministers are starting to do briefs, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, because he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the tax office records are linked to the decisions made by Mr Brown as Secretary of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair's mishap, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "rank for money," voters can safely conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they look.
The misunderstandings aren't as bad as the conservatives make them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been deceptively deceived.
And treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The latest commotion about political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he wanted no publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said that he knew about Mr Abrahams' progress, but did not know that he was illegal, will certainly be questioned thoroughly; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money collector, who learned about the tricky gifts in October.
But so far, Mr Brown is not involved in anything; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these schemes, even though the main part of the payments were made only after its start in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He condemned this violation very quickly by his own party, but diluted his determination by reaching for a proven instrument, a committee to investigate this matter - even more led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, this is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has not had one for six months, and moving on to a real reform of political party funding.
This would require Labour, who are in a tight position to co-operate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a good lead in the polls; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to work out a victory is unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the sub-prime mortgage crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, dorsal fins start to move around.
Now that the US real estate market is fading, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs' analysts say that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if subprime mortgages were infested.
The signs of tension are clear.
There are increasing number of incapacity to pay (with more than 30 days delay) and debited accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
Last month, HSBC announced that it had lost $1.4 billion in the US consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it's too early to panic.
The debited accounts and the inability to repay are still few.
According to Moody's rating agency, 3,89% of the insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below the average.
The deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in America's 2005 bankruptcy laws has led to a sharp decline in the number of reported credit card losses, which make much of the credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good rate of maturity, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts per month.
And trust in credit card securities is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research firm predicts that their 2007 emissions will be 25% larger than last year.
Direct routes to spread the infection between the sub-prime crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when loans for real estate assets run dry, consumers are more likely to be owed credit cards.
Credit card publishers, however, look at the cash flow rather than the value of the guarantee items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean changing the credibility of borrowers.
They may even be advantageous to loan providers.
Consumer incentives to pay off mortgages fall when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on cards is moved up to the priority list for repayment.
Card publishers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risks of a rapid change in the price of guarantee items.
"It will not happen that one beautiful morning we will just review all the loans," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Even though the risk of subprime mortgage-style explosions is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more realistic.
If lower home prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in fraud linked to the former financial leader of Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their statements on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew originally guilty of seven charges of fraud, where he and Fastow were to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- to be enriched at the expense of their employers -- denied.
They were supposed to be in court in January.
However, during the trial before the US District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been on the front page for two years, which took the issuing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of an investigation initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The indictment against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot fraud with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner branch of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a lot of Enron fraud that pushed Enron along the spiral to declare bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this branch by zero, but our three British knew that it was actually of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's share of this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow has misled Enron that the energy company will pay $20 million for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But the $20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the indictment, the bankers received 7.3 million, and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper has been in charge for three years and one month at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Brits were on the loose on bail of $1 million, ordering them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, went bankrupt in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks, it was no longer possible to hide billions of debt or show failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former senior executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their role in the fall of society.
Skilling is serving more than a 24-year sentence.
Judgments over Lay for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were cleared after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-helplessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel for a 24-hour flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is change to return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places, because it's for a narrow family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire's Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of spectacular consumer in mammoth exhibition center at the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers built their booths, hoping to lure the newly rich Russians into everything from the mahogany of unloaded yachts to diamonds decorated with bulkheads to cars that would not be ashamed of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looked carefully for a bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but against us it's pennies and dimes," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
In oil waves, money flows into the Russian capital just as it did when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans got very rich and dragged to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spatters of the '70s, and the Japanese in the' 90s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spending.
The most exclusive luxury brands on this Klondik are looking for their share.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company, is hosting the conference.)
According to the list of the richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total worth of $282 billion.
In addition, the local main institute in the Center for Economic and Financial Research issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "second-class" millionaires in Russia, whose assets add up to $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005, 15,8% of Russians lived below the de minimis threshold.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, London Jewelry Sales and Marketing Representative David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfect, and men are each for a fortune."
When they walked in the evening dress on Sunday evening through the halls, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five years older Svetlana Turovková called themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking at these cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who was covered in designer clothing as a red carpet veteran, with Joan Rivers looking like a housewife.
The fair appeared to be focused mainly on fresh rich, branded Russian shoppers who are willing to sit for several hours in the road to walk around the warehouse, which makes a loud mix of Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiards tables, Dubai apartments, Gund stuffed animals and draughts.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproduction of Rembrandt's painting from hand-painted blue tile in life size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in glitter."
Indeed, the local vendors say that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have moved from bright logos to little known brands of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded trade fairs every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold thread, after $70,000.
On the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, who equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a clearly orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who, on request, edited luxury cars, said that he sold three car bars in the style of interconnected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantom at $55,000.
He showed the reporter a bicycle car designed for a Russian casino owner who had a weave covered with Swarovsky crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich wheels or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconium, he doesn't have to ride those bikes yet," said Mr Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage by 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean much at the moment, given the high price of local real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at a stand operated by Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company erected four British-style red phone booths stuffed with a million-dollar column of fake bills.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaire Fair.
The bystanders stopped to throw a bunch of money around, or to let their friends take a picture of them on their cell phone, resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or simply stuffing a pocket of a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a corrupt operation.
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the big windows of this restaurant a little healthier and watched an ambulance arrive at a white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
The police patrol car soon joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the medical examiner," said Mr Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities haven't found out what caused Miss Arroy's death yet, and they're hoping that toxicology tests, the results of which may not yet be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that led the Newark police to send a wave of sadness.
Miss Arroy was an assistant police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me. "
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the alcohol control commission, and that she left behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the Union District Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine if Miss Arroy died from an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one possibility," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3: 00 in the afternoon, 21: 00.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is supposedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities questioned Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a broken rose bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the basement, he throned a blue barrel in an open garage that says "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain bikes hanging on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy remembered that when he first arrived in New York Police Department in Newark after 25 years, Miss Arroy provided him with invaluable help to chew through the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'This one or this one you should watch out for,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing. "
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to the strengthening of the world's stock exchanges
Last night, stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped up after the hopes of a market that the Federal Bank would try to calm down borrowing conditions by further lowering interest rates were strengthened by the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The exchanges jumped in London, New York, and across Europe, after Donald Kohn, second in line for Ben Bernank, the Fed's chairman, said that in responding to continued pressure on the financial markets, managers must be "flexible and pragmatic."
As part of an obvious effort to calm the irritated markets, in the midst of signs of a reviving credit effort, Mr Kohn said that recent excesses "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October."
He also said that if increased instability persists, the possibility of further deteriorating financial conditions for households and firms would increase.
Investors view these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver further fresh capital injections to US markets, and perhaps further interest-rate cuts to stabilise credit conditions.
These remarks also helped to calm Wall Street down in the midst of other bad news about the US economy, when the sale of flats in October showed record-low figures.
The consequences of financial swirling were underlined by the announcement of the Bear Stearns investment bank that it would abolish 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labor force, in the context of reducing costs due to compensation for heavy losses caused by a failed bet on the provision of low-grade housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13 289.40, while the more used S & P 500 increased by 2.65 percent.
The London index of FTSE 100 increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6 306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions on the markets appeared in full strength after the European Central Bank's three-month cash packages were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7%, which is the most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release above-standard money on London's money markets has increased, with the three-month interbank lending rates of "Libor" rising after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to their maximum since the end of September - 6.59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bobara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who will be number six at bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds on to this position at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughn, the captain, with a decision to help, and because Hugh Morris, the head manager of the English team, is beginning to fill the applications for the national collector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
The one who won't be on the bat in sixth place will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is certainly not.
It's not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past a lower level, sometimes due to lack of happiness rather than abilities.
It is not only in cricket that the selection is challenging and requires an opinion that in the end must always be subjective.
Is it a good time for the Bobar to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if it is?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the Commission - the place is for one.
Who's to say which level is right for a cricket if he can't get down or swim to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a great influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
On the team, the cricket needs to catch the captain's eye at the right moment if he's gonna take a wicket, and the batter needs regular chances at starting positions, if he's ever gonna make an impression as a one-day cricket.
It's more complicated to capture the point of view of a collector.
For example, last season there were many better than James Anderson, whose position in the first test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitching like a gunner.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first class at 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with an equally modest diameter, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for another.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish the career of both, or it may not have much influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka he played Gareth Batty in every test and in first class he served good performances, five wickets and 40 allowed defections, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricket, which is extra, although in Australia against Australia he scored twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training clean at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and will prefer Shah to more experience than Bobar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah, his sparkly and valuable debut test shifts speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class, compared to six of the Bopers, who, at 22 years old, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
But Shah did in two shifts against the Caribbean in May at the Lord's test, his home field in Middlesex, only ten defectors, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the collectors, when Vaughn wanted to re-cast him at the next match, his batting seems to have taken something off the momentum that was so obvious in Mumbai.
By contrast, the Essex universal has a joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket field, and his off-court behavior symbolizes a recently inverted four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and possibly shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched it from a distance to excitedly ask him, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-fast skid pitches on the local playgrounds, which seem to suit it, dispense effectively and batting with confidence and skill.
It's one thing to choose the right person, to choose the right time is different.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which I don't mean to say Shah won't excel if, as Célon tea leaves suggest, he's the one who's playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday and to dump refugees who ran out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even came back to fight the gunmen who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansúr bus station was already there before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of dozens of buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaji, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the papers, because of what was going on in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people," he said, having in mind the Shiite militia of militant spiritual Muktama al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to break the fight.
Kassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the largely Sunni region of Amaría, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaría called him with the support of the US military to help push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's newcomers is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, a few friends called me and told me that they were starting a militia in Sleikhu against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today, "said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken of the appeal of calming the capital after strengthening the US military presence and growth of local "groups of interested citizens," which, with a weapon in hand alongside the US army, defend their neighborhoods.
But they spoke more about the fact that they have been forced back by the obstruction of visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the fifty-one-year-old father of three, expressed a loud suspicion shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force them to return.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people fled Iraqi sectarian assassins.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqis to have to go back to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left."
The partial reason for weakening violence is that the Sunni have been pushed out of Shia regions and vice versa, reducing tensions in many places.
There are concerns that the sudden influx of refugees will once again ignite sectarian tensions and lead to further combat.
Little Sarsko, good education
Germany's smallest Länder plays a leading role in vocational training, excels even the international focus of their universities.
Only in one area of education does Saarland worry about the same shortcoming as the rest of Germany.
"For the 50th time I explained to a man who did not come from Saarland yesterday that we were not French" - this self-ironic motto appears on the posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest Länder.
Meanwhile, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sara education system, which is the fifth place in the monitoring of the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Thus, universities have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even a triple diploma.
Which corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above average number of Saran children is admitted to a university - many of them, even without a high school degree.
"In Saarland, a vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, IW's educational expert.
By obtaining more than any fifth-year-old to study at a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two disciplines are second best in Germany with regard to the population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Sara Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering.
"After Pisa's first study, we made several reforms in general education schools," says the spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to learn as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge - a model taken over by other Länder.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, they will show future comparative studies.
In the course of the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29% to 20%.
In total, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians are better at counting.
And, to the disappointment of Sara's study, Pisa does not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, it is in this area that Sara could score.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory at the Gymnasium - even though the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
The clock in Venezuela is about to change from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will have the clock moved back in this South American country half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
The official sheet of Venezuela has reported that the clock will shift by minus four and a half hours under the new law compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the US, has justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the world to divide time zones after hours.
On Wednesday, local time, Chávez announced that he was interrupting relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage situation.
This left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with the Colombian government or with the Colombian government.
"I can no longer, because of my self-respect," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution that the people of this oil country must vote on in a Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would greatly strengthen his power in the country.
The fight was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels to release the hostages.
Uribe, by his decision Venezuela "spat in the face," criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone has caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet?) - this is the phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was pronounced by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was so upset at the recent ibero-American summit by the vocal remarks of this left-wing populist that he silenced him in this way.
The Germans are facing lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are threatened by a reduction in real wages this year despite strong conjuncture.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, people employed in 2007 can actually expect to receive a lower wage than they did last year.
"There is a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
The new workload may also be waiting in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% in this situation is correct and reasonable for the new year.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should no longer be in such trouble to demand loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, citing the newspaper of this social democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and petroleum products has driven inflation to its highest level over the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by three percent overall.
Venus is the hell twin of the Earth.
Despite its life-hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than expected. The European Venus Express Space Probe on Venus has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices on the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is being shined.
Now, the European Venus Express probe has brought proof - it's picked up electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere.
According to a well-known theory of the origin of primordial matter, life could have come to life on Earth through lightning, and the storms allegedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
It was not the case with Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 ° C.
"Venus may be the hell twin of the Earth, but he's a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar to the Earth's mass and size, began to evolve in a completely different way is the fundamental issue of the Esa mission.
Since no probe has been sent since the early 1990s solely for the purpose of studying Venus Express, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which approached several articles of Nature magazine, did not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighbouring planet is more Earth-like than anticipated," said Ace.
In addition to the already known wind vortices at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which spins much faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air currents in the northern hemisphere, writing a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as the morning girl or the evening girl, will orbit the sun in nearly 225 days.
But it rotates much slower around its own axis. One day on Venus it takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus' surface temperature is 460 ° C and the pressure of 92 bars does not remind the Earth, scientists are based on the fact that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
But on Earth, it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, Venus makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler advocates meeting Merkel with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is calling for an end to the Party's disputes over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting with her in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls on the great coalition to put an end to the conflict over the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," said Köhler to the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to adopt the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universally valid for me," said Köhler.
While the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent Merkel from standing up for herself when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned China's traditional policy.
China also knows, "said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition because of this.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "notable" foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office, the German-Chinese relations have deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve, when European politicians officially accept Tibetan spiritual leaders, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions, which are also located in China, is attempting to separate themselves from China.
Schäubble warns of similar riots that erupted in France
Street fights with the police, shootings, cars on fire, Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not grow into violence on the street, calls on the Federal Minister of the Interior.
The barricades were on fire, the troublemakers fired shotguns at the police. After the serious riots of the youths in France, the Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must make sure that social tension does not arise in our country, too, which will erupt in violence.
We must take this seriously, "said Neue Presse in the Hanover newspaper.
Not every young person is supposed to be able to cope with a quick change in social reality.
The Federal Government, the countries and the municipalities are already working hard to solve the problems, said Schäubble.
Which does not just mean integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we have recorded our first successes."
But caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs were not comparable to those of France.
In the past few nights, teenagers and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have been fighting hard street fights.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
More integration efforts by the German Government were requested by the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned of a "copycat effect."
While the situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
However, action should still be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average high."
Above all, there is a need to ensure a greater number of learning opportunities.
Kolat stressed: "We must give youth hope."
The President of the Turkish municipality added, however, that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many migrants' families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to pay attention."
We have to "allow young people to work and educate themselves quickly."
Meanwhile, the night remained mostly calm in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
There were hundreds of police officers in the field, and there was a helicopter with headlights flying over the area.
Authorized authorities have reported three arrests and several burning trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, he's been looking after the peace of mind for approximately 1,000 deployed order forces.
The police will intervene for as long as necessary, and after visiting the suburb of the Interior Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie.
About 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night in the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Toulouse's riots overtook the following night.
There was a car accident on Sunday that caused two teenagers to die.
According to the primary findings of the D.A. 's office, the police are not to blame for the death of minors.
In the realm of Angela "The Clouds"
The Chancellor's reality is documented by a remote output, that the coalition is programmed at the end, and that we can expect nothing more from it.
What country does this chancellor live in anyway?
After her bleak, indifferent, and content-poor speech at the General Debate of the Federal Assembly, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, manage.
Angela Merkel responded once with a very arrogant sentence to the regret that she was too focused on foreign policy.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
In the Bundestag, she clearly showed everyone how much she deserved the remorse.
Merkel didn't even feel a real interest, let alone a sense of trouble in the country.
Instead, Angela "Clouková" presented herself: a politician who excels over others who flee to foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it praises itself constantly for the conclusions of the Heiligendam Summit, but no longer tells us how the climate objectives are to be achieved in Germany.
And anyway, such self-praise - such immodesty would have been forgiven by the chairman of the CDU two years ago.
Now it's confined to false phrases that could increase her popularity among humans.
This approach harms its imitation pragmatics, which does not need to flatter, because they solve problems.
But in Angela's "Cloud" empire, internal political problems are a marginal issue.
Child poverty and the worry of people with low wages?
She's got a few side sentences left over on these topics.
It is worth noting how often the Merkel are recounted when it comes to child support.
Three times Merkel must start from the beginning in order to be able to pronounce at least the correct sentence in part.
As soon as things get too specific, he stumbles like a complete stranger.
Department Attack
The debate of Republican presidential candidates on Youtube has sprung up in a heated debate for Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorites - and they must both now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney throws his opponent to Rudy Guiliani for turning New York into a "refuge for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with harsh regrets: "I believe that his own home was just one such refuge," he answers and throws at former Governor Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without documents.
As the Republican base has not yet had a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, online users filmed and posted videos only serve as such clues to the key theme.
"This is exactly the policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain throws his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who promotes the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam's veteran McCain doesn't spare his remorse or Romney for refusing to condemn the torture method of questioning known as Waterboarding, which simulates heating.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important issues of the campaign.
The audience starts to applaud whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney in a twist and asks for a party base and a television audience to forgive for being still in 1994 a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in the mundane
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistan's ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
That concludes eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharraf, took a presidential oath and will remain in the presidency for another five years.
Pakistan's television broadcast a live ceremony in the presidential palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed his office to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloody military coup, he ruled for the first time as a civilian head of state.
Musharraf has fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West by withdrawing from the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the state of emergency which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency soon after his oath, and will meet other Western demands.
In the past week, the Supreme Court of the country, which, after declaring the state of emergency at the beginning of November, occupied the lawyers in favour of it, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal area, and four others were injured.
Army spokesman said the bomb went off on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Krautrock Fathers are returning.
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group reseized their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will include Live 1974, a haircut from the most successful band period.
Even then, they were more well-known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three settled gentlemen who initially look like they're enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and buttons in front of them.
63-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
On his left is a 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is centred on synthesizers, is from the audience's point of view to the right.
Everyone adds sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by mistake, they create a traditional song.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians too much.
Among the Krautrock lovers, the band's review of Harmonia has caused quite a stir.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not enough to make this band painfully lacking for 23 years.
But why couldn't a German celebrate his still-living legends of the '70s?
And especially when they value music style, wrongly called krautrock, in England and America, more than in their own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the surviving members of Cologne's can award the Echo Award for life's work, the hall was full of enquired views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the audience's amazement no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert sat with them on the stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we overburden the memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at that time it was far from as much influence as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially they played in the basement of the Berlin theatre Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a gramophone company run by the Church.
Rother helped out briefly with the Kraftwerk group, but gained reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at that time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of Cluster to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of a commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to work as a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a spitzweg artistic being.
The name for a given art is allegedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in a dumpster.
Harmony preserved much of it.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony," followed by "De Luxe."
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
It wasn't just self-knowledge that served to collect the roses.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been edited in front of a record small, barely 50-person set at the Griesse concert.
At that time, Rothera expressed a wish that the members of the Harmony would be eager and occasionally practised.
For Roedlia and Moebius, that was a completely rude request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in an esoteric sphere and secured his future with an album called "The Burning Heart."
The Cluster band came back to life in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland has taken the aim of keeping the krautrock as its original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered by Roedelius' solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of World Culture.
The performance at the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Brit, Julian Cope, the old punk, and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual will be present.
The founder of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will participate.
This is a drawing of the overall extent of the influence of the krautrock on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian En's sentence, accompanied by the most bizarre sounds, floats in the hall: "The unique true music, it owns the future."
There are paintings of a producer with Harmonia in the peasant hall.
The creation of a legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photographs, on which are set of instruments wildly linked cables.
Before that, the three veterans are once again busy improvising.
Not by gluing microphones on organs and drums to exclude the unheard-of-the-past self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three for the meticulous technique.
Not even the House of World Cultures will change that.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, there's a whisper under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place, there's an emphatically singing "Aaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find the roots rather than in the blues in the music universities (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from the art and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not let herself out of peace now.
Even the most obvious is thought through on the scene.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question either deprives a man of his nerves or allows him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With the Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden films, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But neither one of them is convincing.
The idea of movies either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Even an actor like Richard Gere can't stop him at The Hunting Party.
The good news is that the war criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but that is where, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere will be found.
We have recently lost sight of this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he played in many attractive, unserious roles in cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the topic of Buddhism, they will take a man's appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for seeing The Hunting Party - where the hunter becomes the prey (why must the names of the films nowadays be so long and tangled?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere might have become if fate and the film industry hadn't been so merciful: a man who has had his best years behind him, but still retains some remarkable charm as a ruin-like monument.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, is also entering the cinema this week, just continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden, we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who will save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and then one of them will fall in love with her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television film is changing too soon in shooting and action.
There's gonna be a lot like Cobra 11 from the movie without the freeway, but for the war.
On The Hunting Party, you can literally explore why the Balkan War has not yet been able to make a really good film.
The story of three American war reporters who go after a "fox," a Serbian top war criminal, could, at another time and under the leadership of another director and writer (here is both Richard Shepard), perhaps become a new "Apocalypse."
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the depraved and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft will also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party movie can finally be written off after reporters have managed to do what NATO, the CIA, and all world criminals have failed to do in the last five years: catch criminals and leave them with just revenge on Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of film production that it would be worth turning to the International Court of the Hague.
Yet this film has a deeply human message.
It condemns that Karadzić and Mladić are still at large, and suspect Americans and French (here they are exceptionally united) that they do not pursue persecution intensively enough under secret political agreements.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar, women come to us with a famous poem by Brecht.
In it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "With compassion I look at the swollen veins on my forehead, marked: how strenuous it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, they perform exactly those swollen heads, but they suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
It was recently reported in this paper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were major failures.
There is only one thing to add: no good film has ever been made about South Africa.
Almost always: When a star hangs around a crisis zone or walks around a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Breakdown Boundary with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamond with Leonard DiCaprio is created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie - Schindler's list.
Many films must probably mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse" or "Lead vest" - were not celebrated in any way then as masterpieces.
But maybe today, with every mass murder at home appearing on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers then do not have the ability that is needed to tell the good stories without fault.
"To be or not to be" or "the great dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin had not yet known how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcastically measured artistic view of Lawrence Norfolk as a novelist.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "the Balkan War," he said: "The only thing that matters is that some things never change.
Large cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia. "
Von Beust collects criticism for the Olympics
The mayor's resignation from the summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has come to a sharp criticism of politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight to organize the games at the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in the estimation of chances.
The chief manager of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday identified this decision as "unfortunate in terms of business."
No other project has recently woken up as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain such a high level of sporting political enthusiasm."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with his previous statements, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on Munich's candidacy for winter games in 2018.
"This preference means to us that with the time schedule of 2028, we have no realistic chance."
Yet this dream is not over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beustu's statements regrettable.
It is the impression that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games over the next 25 years.
"It is still too early to destroy your chance by calling the plans buried already at this early stage," said the President of the HSB, Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
The renunciation would be contrary to the testimony of the head of the Senate, which he delivered at the General Meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy at the University in 2015 as a replacement for the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg College Sports Association has only nominated for a candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in the Senate's Hamburger Parliament has argued that it is wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of Klein Grasbrook has been braked by the Senate for years because it has bet on the organisation of the Olympics and excluded the construction of flats," said SPD Members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook continued to plan the Olympics, with the whole area later being used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor."
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games has given rise to great enthusiasm for its time in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, has been shipwrecked in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the terms to Sweden and the wooden boxes doesn't think of Andy Warhol, they think of Ike.
Is it?
Wooden crates produced in Sweden today cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of his listed ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of the Warhol "Brillo Boxes" from 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm with the result of disillusionment; the six "Brillo Boxes" which in 1995 was donated by the Moderna Museum by its former director Pontus Hulten, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type, which are in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curator events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes that were based on the red and blue-white design of paper boxes of soap powder Brillo.
The exhibition of his works at Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from a cardboard box. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about art, it was about their designs, just show pieces.
Warhol probably also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo cases in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in the Moderna Museum.
The witnesses are now talking about fifteen boxes, which at the time rightly entered art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the name "Stockholm Type."
Some of them were auctioned off for over $100,000 at the auction.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hulten Museum later falsely claimed that approximately a hundred cases were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hulten boxes were manufactured in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of the Moderna Museum, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood plates were painted in the basic colour and trimmed, the brush was painted with oil white.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies revealed that the paint was applied directly to the plywood plate without the previous primer - in addition, it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official charter of Brillo Boxes," he was heard by the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to other conclusions, Moderna Musyet will have to classify six cases from his exhibition collections as" exhibition material - copies. "
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "flagship accusations" that were made in the case of soap powder boxes.
But the organization still persists in relentless silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had fortified themselves in a hotel in Manila demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The insurgent commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption during the election, told the hotel reporters that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the government had attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours before, about two dozen soldiers were fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood trial for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers who were supposed to be watching him apparently ran over to his side and joined the riot.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government's loyal troops have sealed off the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of soldiers.
"People have had enough," said Triallnes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other troops will be joining the march shortly.
Government critics called for a major demonstration against the President on Friday.
For months, her government has been blamed for corruption.
As early as 2003, Manila's financial area became the main scene of a revolt of about 200 troops against Arroy.
Since the army refused to join the rebels, the rebellion failed less than 24 hours later.
Since 1986, in the Philippines, they have tried to overthrow the democratically elected government at least seven times.
United Internet becomes Versatel's majority shareholder
The United Internet has secured more than a 20% share of Versatel's telecommunications business.
On Wednesday, the company announced that the average price per share was EUR 14.46.
It is said that the company now owns 20,05% of the core share capital.
Before that, there was speculation about taking over.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its shareholding in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market by this step.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the company of this Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5% to 15.1%, there were guesses of entry on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution only holds shares for a third party.
Yesterday, the United Internet in Drillisch, which is a provider of mobile telecommunications networks, had almost 10% of its share.
As part of the capital increase Drillisch put another 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million for sale.
Of which 5,15 million shares were purchased for 31.4 million euro by the United Internet.
The companies discussed together marketing cooperation in DSL products and mobile networks.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained the spokesperson for the United Internet.
In order to take over the competing company Freenet, the companies together set up a joint venture of SMEs.
On Thursday, the United Internet announced that both companies in Freenet will, for the time being, be satisfied with a share of more than 10% and will not use their right to take over another 18,49% of this company.
It is considered that companies are still open to all options, especially the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
Interviews between the United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and hard-to-see Freenet game is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million mobile customers and 1,27 million complete customers or DSL connections.
Holding United Internet and Drillische still held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will get around 4%.
The right to purchase 18,49% of the Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
