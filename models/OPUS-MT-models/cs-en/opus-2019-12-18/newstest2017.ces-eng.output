Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the stairs of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he has no idea who would want to hurt him, and he adds: "Finally, he has succeeded. "
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, reported by the medical examiner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation is underway.
The brother of Louis Galicia's victim for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, a former chef in Boston, acquired his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters spokesperson said they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss them very much," said the speaker.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and grief belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia reported that Frank at first slept in the residential hotels, but that recently "he was finally getting well. "
"He found an apartment, dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to contact his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who took things the way they are.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that lit up every day," he said.

The Czech Railways invested over 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the last six years, the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually falling.
The Czech Railways have invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles in the last six years.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent was reflected in the reduction of average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger proportion of the investment was put into regional transport, where approximately 60 percent of the money was spent, and 40 percent of the company invested in the renewal of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years old.
Modernized older vehicles, however, are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not counted, the average age of ČD drive vehicles would increase by ten years.
A little older are on average passenger wagons whose average age is 23 years old when counting modernizations.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
However, in recent years the classic trains made up of wagons and towed locomotives have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic wagons decreased from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was particularly rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments planned by ČD in the fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for a speed of up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic express lines.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online journal Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of the billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only an interesting tourist walk in the trees, but also an Olympic park.
The highway managers know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of ads like this all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there is a flawed law that makes it impossible to eliminate illegal mobile billboards right away.
A complex bureaucratic circle is needed first.
In the meantime, the company will change its name and the office will be short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted a quarter year ago: At the main move from České Budějovice to Lipno there is an advertising billboard on our property next to the state road.
Not even three months were enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares that they're standing right next to the road in a 50-meter protection zone where no one's allowed to stand for security.
Road managers say they can't simply deal with billboards because of a leaky law.
Maybe pick him up and take him away.
"We must not just afford this," says Nina Ledvinová, spokesperson for the Road and Motorway Directorate and refers to a complex bureaucratic circle that must be preceded by the removal of the billboard by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to monitor the online journal Aktuálně.cz in detail in spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
Likewise, there are other regions.
"We have difficulty forcing the companies to remove the banners," confirms the head of the Department of Transport of the Czech Budějovice Regional Authority, Jiří Klása, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klása, there's a leaky law that ties officials to blame.
First, he has to call the complex billboard owners to put the ad away.
But the company's bosses are often inaccessible or know the trick that was already described in the past by Aktuálně.cz when it became more interesting about the issue: just move the mobile display with advertising a few meters and officials can throw the previous challenge to remove the black ad in the basket.
That's because the Bureau has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we must address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
A new law could have brought about a change that will ban billboards off the highways from September next year and limit them to I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertisements will remain the same as they have been.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on the leases of illegal areas and no one can.
For example, the billboard that attracts Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the Czech Budějovický magistrate is currently leading three administrative proceedings for black billboards.
There's a $30,000 fine in every trial.
These are more advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of the I. class road.
The proceedings are not yet completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Department of Transport of the Czech Budějovice City Council.
The advertisement, which Aktuálně.cz is interested in, does not appear among these cases yet, but will most likely be added to them.
According to the spokesperson of ŘSD Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, so the case will be put on the table by regional and then probably Magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
She doesn't take the mail and canceled her official residence in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail went to South Bohemia businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the brand Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has, however, rejected any connection in the past.
This spring, when ŘSD began to take an interest in advertising on Lipno, Fischer had state officials send a letter to his pension, where the company is supposedly newly based, to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard.
Even from this address, however, no one has yet called the highway managers.
It's a wasted fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes in the mansions are not uncommon.
We gradually gave one company two million crowns of fines a few years ago.
But she changed her name and I.C.O. and there was nothing to solve.
The executor returned the case, the ads went on, maybe in other places.
We're pretty helpless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admitting one of the officials on condition that anonymity is maintained.
No one is discussing the amendment in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several Members who were interested in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and rather schizophrenic topic not only for national, but also regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand, they know about social demand for restrictions, on the other hand, they need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't stand for the quite established impression that when something doesn't work, there's a need to change the law.
Farmers harvest less grain this year, but more rape and poppy, estimate statistics.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the cereals harvest will be 6.6% lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop exceeds the average in the last five or ten years.
On the other hand, the harvest of rape (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The grain harvest will be 6.6% lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This results from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth-rate decline against last year.
Last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average in the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rape and poppy will be higher this year.
The beets are harvested by the growers by 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they put 1,256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected fall in cereal production is due both to a reduction of 3.7 percent per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per hectare per
Farmers made three percent less fields this year.
The winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers have planted it in more fields.
However, lower yield per hectare will be signed, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Approximately one-fifth of the fall in statistics is expected for spring barley, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
The reduction of rotational areas is 15.2%, but also lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the contrary, will be delivered 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also grow.
The crop of rape is estimated by statists at 1,305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The rotational area has expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hecktar yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rape crop will exceed a 10-year average of 13.3 percent, while it is sown on an area of one third larger than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also increased.
This year, the farmers raised him at 35.543 hectares.
The year 2008 when poppy was cultivated in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, but the field is half.
This year's poppy harvest will be richer thanks to the expansion of the rotational areas.
It's going to go up 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons against last year.
But hecktar yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc cops accused two men of attacking a knife and a machete, court sent them into custody.
Police charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in downtown Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the victim tried to escape, they caused him a cut and cut wound which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," said police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
Both the obvious perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by the police.
The plaintiff filed a motion by the court to take them into custody and was granted by the court on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Cops charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man downtown Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him severed and cut wounds, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which occurred on Tuesday at noon right on the class of Liberty, reported by the police.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed Olomouc police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
A mass struggle between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal altercation, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man using a knife and a machete.
Although the victim tried to escape, he was injured by cutting and cutting wounds, which required treatment in the hospital and other treatments, reported police spokespersons.
During a scuffle that attracted a lot of attention in the city centre, and because of which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the ground, it was a family dispute.
CSIs accused a 34-year-old male from Slovakia and a 37-year-old male from Olomouc of attempted severe battery and disorderly conduct.
The plaintiff filed a motion for the court to take them into custody and the court granted him on Friday, supplemented by a spokesperson.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass fight also five years ago, it happened then only a few dozen meters further, before the disco of Varna on Riegra Street.
At that time, police reported that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company who were standing at the front door.
According to the police, they had knives and sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two of the attacking foreigners with conditional punishment.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk by them every day.
One of the most exhilarating examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovažné náměstí.
She should have been a hotel by now.
But still nothing.
That we need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the center of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment houses which, despite their location, size and often also the conservation of monuments, are just barren and emptiness.
We have selected properties in the centre using the project "Empty Homes.cz," which maps vacant properties on the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of their owners' financial problems, opaque relationships between firms, or a state that does not know or wants to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless.
Whether the owners pay a special tax for them, they want an initiative

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year.
They donated more than a million dollars to the Clintons for charity.
Most of Clinton's income - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democrats' candidate for the Presidential Office Hillary Clinton published her tax statements on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP agency.
Most of Clinton's income - over $6 million - is for their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that last year the Clintons paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent and then a national and local income tax of 9 percent.
So they paid 43.2 percent of their income on taxes in total.
Trump has a problem with a similar step, yet he has not decided to publish his tax return.
There's a certain possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, she wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after she published her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to Trump's income secrets, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as wealthy as she claims to be, said AP.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Caine, who is running for Vice President in tandem with the former First Lady, published today a report on his tax contributions in the last ten years.
Together with their wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity, and last year they paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes.
In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented a consistent vaccination and killed a doctor.
Children's polio cases reappeared in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government announced an emergency vaccination because two children with this disease were paralyzed.
The vaccines delivered helicopters.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were in the affected area, who defended the vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus passed unnoticed.
In the northeast of Nigeria, emergency polio vaccination begins because two children with this disease have been paralyzed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children and another four million will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and in the surrounding countries.
According to AP, Nigerian military helicopters quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the virus has been circulating unnoticed for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past prevented vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where polio children were detected on Thursday.
Both disabled toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the eradication of polio, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC station that vaccination in Nigeria would start next week.
In Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram worked for a long time.
The area was only made available to international organisations and government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken substantially in this part of the country.
The Nigerian Minister of Health Isaac Adewole admitted that new polio cases are a great disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to report that polio was eradicated next year.
WHO pointed out that it is possible that although the disease has not appeared for two years, it has spread among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and the north of Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the emotional stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from a pimp gang.
The Pope listened to their hard life stories and called on them to look confidently into the future.
František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an increase in the fight against it.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes in Rome who were liberated by the police from the power of a pimp gang.
For more than an hour, the head of the Catholic Church listened to the emotional stories of fallen women and then called on them to look confidently into the future, said the Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes that Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an increase in the fight against him, said the Pope's spokesman.
František often draws attention to the fates of people on the outskirts of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and June due to his personal invitation.
France will strike at the jihadist factories.
But it can't be done without the help of Muslims.
The Muslims themselves are to help France to combat radical Islamism.
Moreover, Prime Minister Manuel Valls' government is preparing fundamental changes in the operation of mosques and the education of clergymen.
Since last December we closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms.
And others will follow, announced by the Home Secretary.
There are over a hundred jihadist manufacturers in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who undermine public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom for this confession," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mosques from abroad.
At the moment, some 20 percent of the money from abroad is coming from Morocco, Algeria, and the Gulf countries.
This is also why preachers who can sow radicalism in France come to the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," said the Prime Minister.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should function as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam now operates in the country, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the Foundation should have contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon affected by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate on a new institution that will replace a dysfunctional foundation was on fire.
Other terrorist attacks in France, carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists, have hastened everything.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently been told that a new foundation will be established in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - ensuring financing of mosques from domestic sources and also overseeing imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take money not only for the construction of new mosques but also for various educational centres.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or halal food tax.
In practice, halal food vendors would pay for the provision of certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation's register.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Each year, some 30,000 travel to Saudi Arabia for a traditional pilgrimage.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should be present in the mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching work is consistent with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in a campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, announced recently by the Minister of the Interior.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
According to estimates, some 2500 mosques and prayers work in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams and are considering it for several other tens.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize themselves will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert at the National Science Research Center.
Tracker Kelemen lost the first round sprint with star Bauge.
The Czech track cyclist has to fight for the procedure to the eight finals.
The track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, following a sprint qualification among the top eighteen, lost a duel with the French great Grégory Baugé, defender of silver from past games in London in the first round.
He must fight for the procedure to the eight finals in the repair rides.
27 riders stood at the start of the royal discipline on the track and the best Czech tracker of the present time added the 14th best time.
Two hundred with a fleeting start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was thus expected to qualify for the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Although Kelemen insisted on an experienced Frenchman at the end, he kept an eye on the procedure.
Jason Kenny's gold defender flashed with great performance.
Twenty-eight-year-old Brit took the third fastest two hundred history and won the qualification in Olympic record 9.551.
As expected, he also easily dealt with the last advance, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet also succeeded in lineup with Bradley Wiggins, who in the 4 km fighter race set a new world record of 3:50,570 and advanced to the finals.
The maximum available to the British (3:51,659), which was four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Push: They Want Fresh Wind in the Field
Representatives of young doctors have gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over the new treaty.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire Council to support further field events in early September.
The JDC says that the ministers failed to resolve the questions about the contract.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government remained "still silent" on questions, which was a big deal to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the executive body of the JDC decided to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request new formal negotiations on all issues. "
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Board of the JDC formally asked for special meetings of the BMA Board to approve the running programme of the heated field events in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to declare six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawiana, resigned following the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
At meetings before the vote before 54,000 young doctors and medical students, BMA said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would impose a burden on medical professionals in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of "unlearables"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal termination of eight months of a long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the luxurious palace hall in St Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin wasn't smiling, and he barely showed warmth, even by his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but they would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin has shown that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speech: the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey at the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin was punching around, and he accused Ankara of sticking a knife in Moscow's back.
The scandal was all the more so when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media has been running a massive global campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious was the accusations made by senior state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But there was an official message in St Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology he asked of President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost out of power during a failed coup last month, which is why he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken it.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have had a severe impact - in particular the cancellation of charter flights, which each year transport several million Russian tourists on the coast of Turkey.
This figure has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be relieved when flights can be restored.
They earn money from Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkish are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedemost newspaper.
But the visit was of further political value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what she considers a poor response to an attempt at coup.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about entry into the EU and Putin's accession - which is eager to be able to take advantage of the cooling and tearing the ties of Turkey with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after attempting a coup.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as "the alliance of the incompatible": how the forces of the two countries that feel rejected and used by the West unite.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
You could say that, after almost three hours of opening talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they did not even mention this issue.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states could find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of complete disaster, when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders speak to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's executive director, the RBS brand is to be repressed into the role of back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland station that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It eased from them when eight years ago it almost vanished and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, strategy brands used "RBS" to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It was worth millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Winbledom Champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more excellence to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not start new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the stock exchange headquarters and coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more to the fore - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our trips to Inverness-shire customers and employees, McEwan answered our questions to Ross McEwan.
The BBC station Scotland said: "The RBS brand will cease to be our investor's brand and brand for which our employees work because we are now much more becoming a brand bank. "
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have domestic-focused efforts.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations Championship, has prepared a profile of individual brands of sports sponsorship.
"The time has come for us to move on to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would have become a great customer bank and introduced the brands.
But along with the way we focused on customers' needs, and not our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can recall these marks, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket riding Predition led to the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win in Newmarket brought him 3000 wins
Frankie Dettori's jockey secured a 3,000th UK win in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by his second victory of the evening on his local track - on the horse Predition, which is trained by John Gosden.
Forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar horse, said: "It's strange. "
I'm very touched because my family is here, too.
I am extremely glad that this happened at the Newmarket, because this is where I docked 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predition after winning
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in obstacle races - the champion of jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who, during his career, has scored more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical guitar that separates it from the other riders in the dragonfly.
He's a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't only been on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie rode a winner in the UK for a bigger part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's a lively character, which is good for British racing sports, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flight jump
Frankie Dettori has been a messenger of British flat races for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
A vast number of winners of big races, including his known "great seven" in Ascot. He also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off for drugs.
Three years ago, he was stagnating for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban, but he demonstrated incredible inner strength and, despite all the doubters, he returned in his best form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has already said that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin released the chief of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the presidency on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "leaved Ivanov from his services as head of the Russian presidential office, " but there was no reason.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno was a diplomat before.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (Russian) states that later he was head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of draft laws and control of the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov asked him to resign from his post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Will she make smiles?
This move has completely mysticized Moscow.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At the meeting with President Putin, broadcast by the state television, both men said that he was leaving the office at his own request.
But only a few people convinced the smiles on the cameras - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once thought of as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy met with great distrust.
On the Kremlin website are quoted notes to Putin, in which Ivanov states: "In 2012 I asked you in an interview to give me this very challenging post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I've been head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
Previously, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At the time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could succeed Putin at the head of the state after his second parliamentary term, because the third period would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin's, Dmitri Medvedev.
Just three and a half years later, Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the "Ideas of the Criminal," was released after he hit the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views last month in Los Angeles.
The TV stations ABC and CBS producing the series announced their release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before he announced his firing.
There have been creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in the statement.
According to ABC and CBS TV reports, the details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series that follows the stories of the FBI's team of agents are a little bit later.
The 44-year-old actor, who was famous for his lead in the Dharma and Greg sitcom, has been in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the idea of a criminal, and over the last 12 years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in his statement, which he published on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that won't be possible right now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and especially the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28.
In Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels that have been left behind by a water storm.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his discovery on the Periscope channel in the belief that someone could help him explain how about five - inch [5 cm] fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So it is the first of the four seals between the "fences of platforms" that are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The project for £1.35 billion is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel on an impressive scale to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
There is now more than 79% of the total surface area of the bridge, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now casting in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first closure in every bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of the construction industry.
After the installation of the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
This is what we did by stretching the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and it had to be pulled with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance with which the team worked was very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being flushed by water from their fishing boat near Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Boat Station sounded an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. of British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued undisturbed.
"We saw their boat circling near them and we thought the worst of it," said Moelfre Vince Jones, the lifeboat helmsman.
"Fortunately, the strong wind flew him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life vest exhausted as he held the buoy.
They've all been taken aboard the coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: "Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the roll-over occurred.
Someone upstairs held a protective hand over those guys.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of the Silent's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the indictment, were to receive from Prime Minister Nečas and his then chief of Cabinet Jana Nagy a political newsroom, i.e. a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
The Snapper, Fuksa and Silencer made it possible by their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions at state firms.
That is why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, it was wrong to compensate almost CZK 2 million.
The Silencer is now acting as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse in the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Still, Judge Helena Králova wants to be cautious (solving criminal matters - note red.) and prevent possible objections.
The case will probably be in charge of another Prague court district.
The king has already twice exonerated Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to follow Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
In this case, the Deaf didn't make a statement.
According to Jaroslav Ortman's lawyer, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way to exclude the court if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to be judged after that, he remarked for the diary.
"I think it's out of control," he said.
Roman Boček, a former clerk, is also charged in the case of political newsrooms.
But according to his attorney, Peter Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed on 13 June the prosecution of former Chief of Cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagy (now Nečas) and other accused in the case of abuse of military intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová and her husband are coming to court.
The Silent One was supposed to address the words about Peroutek.
For example, the wife of the Exmissary was to judge President Miloš Zeman's remarks on the democratic prewar journalist Ferdinand Peroutek.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She and two of her same old friends flew to Syria last February from Gatwick Airport in London.
The British Home Office didn't comment on her death.
According to the police, young Londoners who fled home were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, were directed by the media to their other former classmate from the London school of Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year, the case caused a huge wave of attention and also tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that about 600 British Muslims have so far traveled to Syria, of which about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred thousand bucks.
Excellently paid job you don't even need a college for.
That's what I.T.'s job looks like at first glance.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only extremely high salary on Czech conditions (you can earn up to 180 000 CZK in Prague), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists are among the most wanted according to Grafton personnel agency statistics.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
The candidates do not compete for a job position, but the candidates' positions are commented by Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
College education is not a necessity for IT students.
College education is a good basis and is an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and education, but it often does not have much to do with the knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which will not be replaced by a college degree, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money is made in Prague.
Wages of I.T.s are moving all over the Republic average.
They come to the most money in Prague and Brno, it is not such a hit parade in the regions.
"Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
The tech directors will make the highest profit.
In Prague and Brno they can come to CZK 120,000 - 180,000.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also required.
They can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK on arrival.
Fighting is about graduating.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this does not apply to I.T.s.
In fact, if I'm gonna drag the companies over and overpay an expert from another company, they're gonna be happy to grab a graduate.
They can raise him on their own terms.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for IT students.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, there are a number of cases where firms are looking for a highly educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if the support worker controls more foreign language, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds director Kubačka.
Yeah, in Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly can Czech workers envy employees in Google.
Of course, for them is flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various shorter periods, not just for moms.
"The new father's company provides four weeks of extra leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Joneková, Google spokesperson.
Pampering also involves health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn is green and doesn't care what else he wants to learn.
But that doesn't stop the benefits.
Such a full fridge free of charge is definitely not to be thrown away.
Healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchen in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And so that nothing needs to be thrown out, so that what you don't eat is put in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these incredible advantages on Czech terms?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker adds.
The UN has strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees on Thursday.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian Government "is causing serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law" warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in the statement.
He warned that "it is particularly troubling to see how important and influential public figures express public support for the criminal armed fighters who brazenly organize refugee hunts at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. "
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory in an irregular manner are automatically arrested," Zeid emphasized.
What is even worse - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own, under international law.
Bulgaria detained 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21 000.
Pokemon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Many people over the past decade have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outdoors and prefer free time to screens.
Pokemon Go lifts people from the sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally sprung on TV, later on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It's great to see that the technology and activities out there are not excluded.
I am talking, of course, about the fashion that Pokemon Go is, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more was created).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was postponed due to the massive interest that led to server overload.
Pokemon Go has acquired more users within a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, smartphone players go out looking for Pokemons that watch with GPS, and when they find them, they can "photo" them (through screenshot on the phone) or "catch" them.
Mania has captured a generation who, at a younger age, played the game, picked it up from the seats and drove out looking for Pokémon.
In the US, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that a "average" person will take every day.
The Cardiogram app for Apple's smart watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people who practiced for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokemon Go is playing - it only sees raw data about levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns aimed at "find 30 " and" got off the couch " and "were active every day " fell on barren soil, because most public health messages are boring and addressed to people who do not look good.
Nevertheless, the importance of the exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot complete here.
But the beauty of the game Pokemon Go is that people go out and do something that they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight, and entertainment.
Some even make new friends in the pursuit of pokémon.
As is the case, of course, there are some boring patrons looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can come in the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps, like Fitbit, could track our activity, but they didn't give us any reason to do anything like this game.
The novelty looks and the interest in it begins to fade at some point.
But thanks to the success of the Pokemons, more games will appear that combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help many people in pursuit of activity, health and a better form.

Simone Biles has won gold in the multi-fight of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort on the beam.
Everyone was speechless in the plains.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday the 19-year-old American gymnast went straight to the title in multi-fight, and the others in full line under the Olympic spotlights overcame.
The total result of 62,198 clearly confirmed its lead in front of the silver medalist and member of the team "final five" by Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during the performance on the beam in the finals of the multi-boats of individuals in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row, who won the multi-fight, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnasts of her generation and possibly the best ever.
When her overall final evaluation was on the board and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of unique athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals in world championships - including 10 gold medals. Her fascinating sets are a mixture of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between her and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), on the left, and Aly Raisman hugs after winning the gold and silver medal in the finals of the women's multiboat individual at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles received a Tuesday when she was an exclamation mark at Martha Karolyi's leaving team coordinator's party.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the top she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of her routine in plain - one that contains a typical triple double flip - is set in Latin music, which would just fit home, in the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multi-fight competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a victory sequence that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time with two turns, it was just an illusion.
The hammer and the plain - where Biles defends the world championship - await.
She got back to the lead with 15,433 points for the beam - and finished with 15.933 points in the plain.
Raisman gently hugged her while waiting for the final score - just a formality - and around the glittering red, white and blue shadows, Biles appeared tears when she fulfilled the wish she had written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was kind of payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but then she eats bronze because of the sum of the top three sets.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "grandmother" was way ahead.
After her simple, she sent air kisses to the crowd, conquered by a return that seemed uncertain at times.
For Biles, the contribution that this 19-year-old athlete put on Twitter this week, where she became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl aged 12 died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight shots from the handgun and then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth a triple homicide robbery because the assailant didn't take the wallets or the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had.
Police spokesperson in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were looking for any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic neighborhoods, nine attacks occurred in four months, killing seven people and two others injured.
"It's happening in the villa district in front of the houses" said Howard earlier this month for the KPHO branch of CBS station.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including brown Nissan from the late '90s, black BMW from the late '90s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transported to a hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the scene.
The witness told the police that it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty shipment only half an hour before the triple murder.
Investigators found shell casings and built a bullet from bullet residue in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six - year - old child with microcephalia: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and of course also his mother.
But unlike her peers, she suffers from a microcephalia that is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is absolutely not true - of course you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing that anymore," explains Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But some milestones are already slowly filling.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth's doing the sign language that Edmund uses to say "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto said for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - says Edmund made up some characters himself.
Microcephaly may arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary substantially.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciuto resembles an emotional tax that takes on an uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never really asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to tell me at all.
But Picciuto has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
The heavy rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rains and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme lyachia, a number of rivers in the southeast Louisiana and in the southern Mississippi will spill from their shores and threaten large floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson for the governor's office for national security and crisis preparedness, said they were receiving requests for vehicles for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only the Tangipaho precinct asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most South Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service stated in the statement that there may be more than 8 to 13 centimeters of rain above the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on standby on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are supposed to curl up on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could flood a number of houses in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further pointed out that the danger was the flood downstream in the Ascension district, when these flooded streams would only slowly be poured into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little bit further south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded level of local time on Friday at 9:00 a.m.
Paramedics are still picking up people from stormy waters in the county of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were already on Friday among the rescued at Gloster.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said his other stepson, who lives nearby, alerted him.
"We woke up and the water was coming," said Hansford.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever had on a river in 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family members were disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford reported that emergency workers rescued all three massive military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, the floods spread "fastly" and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities indicated that heavy rain and paid roads required the rescue of residents from their homes in the district of Tangipahoa and the abolition of teaching in five school districts.
The branch of WWL station CBS announced that 200 homes were flooded according to the old man from Tangipah.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which are both now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been imprisoned by the high water.
In the village of Amite and in the town of Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to fall," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed because of the flood in the Tangipahoa district in Hammond, and locals were provided with sandbags that could be picked up and tried to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last big floods here in March," said the manager of Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, said that persistent rain continues on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said a couple of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but none of them showed up on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and she's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "boy shot like a raid," survived shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia.
His grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He took too much, his little body was shot to death," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, to the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and underwent several surgeries.
A family for the station said the boy should recover.
He was supposed to be in first grade elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men aged 29 is critical, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in stable condition.
According to the station report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
CBS investigators at Philadelphia said there was probably a gunfight between several armed men.
There were casings found at the scene of a type of assault weapon belonging to various offensive weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," said Anthony Ginaldi, captain of the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one's been arrested, and the police are supposed to be investigating surveillance video footage.
Another six-year-old kid, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a stray bullet on Tuesday in front of the house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is just how I imagine a female gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And two: there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of black women and Latin women at the top of this sport.
Gymnast number one in the past four years was African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second rungs last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became champion of the Olympic Games, and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-fold world winner Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who demonstrated unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the female multi-fight of individuals.
And team member Aly Raisman got silver.
We're witnessing a sports peak, but it doesn't look like that in gymnastics class in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic Team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnast team for the next Olympic Games will only be composed of four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that maintain parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travels, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for gymnasts and gymnasts families it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer gymnastics free of charge or with low costs in Harlem for more than 15 000 young people within the city (especially Negro and Hispanic origins) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and work.
It is this team's inspiration that will send thousands of young girls to us who want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing "girl power" and winning the Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes.
The ministers hoped that, after the conclusion of the revised agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be an end to disagreements about changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election refused the contract.
Hunt revealed in July plans to enforce a contract with NHS being in "nobody's country" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures in order to improve care in nonsocial hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Young Doctors, said in a statement last night: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and thus fair treatment of all doctors. "
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with the unwillingness to involve Dr and often with the deafening silence of the government.
And in spite of Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, press for coercion and resolve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed because nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among protestors.
The Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be a settlement of disagreements regarding changes.
BMA wants higher pay for work on weekends for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, called on young doctors not to engage in any strike.
Mortimer said: "A major event will achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families will rise. "
Over the past two months, we have dealt with the Council of Young Doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and Others, we have responded positively to concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as utilization, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after career interruption, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was proof of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs about 60 crowns (two pounds).
Ticagrelor's blood clotting medication reduces the risk of a seizure in heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or any other attack.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that people receive the medicine for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But NHS watchdog NICE now recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer from another attack or heart attack.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a build-up of fat that creates a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is removed, blood clots may occur, blood access to the heart and heart attack may be blocked.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can continue, block the blood supply to the brain, and cause a stroke.
People who have had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of less likely clot formation.
In the proposal for a NICE directive published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences. "
Fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
It has been shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already experienced a heart attack.
We are pleased to be able to extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who can benefit from Ticagrelor's preliminary recommendation.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - particularly on the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, treatment is not recommended in the design for this period.
With computer culture, frauds in Muslim areas began to flourish
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, which is now mentioned in the government report.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes police, electoral inspectors and town halls for ignoring the abuse of voters because of their "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption intervention, said that the intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should protect the cordons and the parachute voters from the polls.
He recommended that voters take with them the identity card and can prove who they are during the election.
At present, voters need to state their name and address.
In the report, it is further proposed to apply indelible ink to the fingers of persons when they submit their voice, in order to avoid being voted twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press be given greater access to the documents of the sitting and to decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"It is not only protection against electoral fraud, but also protection of the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, the special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor of the city of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post after the accusation of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "cynically intervened" religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to Rahman, "he led his campaign to be a religious obligation for devoted Muslims to vote for him. "
Up to 300 votes were called into question or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives himself over to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the frauds of the correspondence vote - which is claimed by older members of the Muslim community during which they pressured people to vote for the candidates they elected.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document.
His report states: "The evidence has been provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh. "
"There was a concern that... state institutions were eyeing such behavior because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion. "
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including preventing political activists from manipulating correspondence votes in order to prevent "earning votes."
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also asks for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and welfare fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present an identity document before the vote.
The use of ink-free on people's fingers in the vote to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
Ban political agitators and activists from manipulating the submitted correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police the authority to create cordons around the polling rooms.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute people who are under illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Disable taking photos in polling rooms.
To demand that only the English (except Wales) work in the polling rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to electoral booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it's "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Court of Elections ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the ineffective "checkbox check" in the electoral register department at City Hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in the Tower Hamlets case by waking up.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threatens this reputation.
Crazy biking doppelganger Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of famous figures at the Rio Olympics
Fans of Olympic Games in Rio 2016 went crazy this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevotová, who is remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only athlete seeking gold this year, who can boast of her own doppelganger from among famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL Women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a game hunter: A member of the American team of archers Brady Ellison (left) was from childhood compared to Leonard DiCapri
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer might be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
The racer from the team of American archers Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his shots appeared, in which he strikingly resembles a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he had been hearing about his similarities with Leo since he was a kid.
"He himself sees no great resemblance, except perhaps the beard," said Brady for Huffington Post.
"He's a cool guy, and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between the British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin with her big, distinctive eyes was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for several years to the star of the series Gell Matthew Morrison.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan with the "athletic version" of the actor from the movie Beginning (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova not only boasts the same skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord, and Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team says she looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Wonderful women: Soccer star Hope Sol (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not just one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On waves theory: According to this user there may be a reason for similar appearance of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction at the fact that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical. "
The football star Hope Sol and the actress of Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes shape.
Among other favourite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medal winner for Gabby Douglas, proud of her beautifully wide smile, who is copying Gabrielle Union's smile, the star of Bravo, girls!
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games apologizes for saying that she "exploded"
Ai Yanhanová, a 14-year-old commentator by Byron MacDonald, dismayed the audience from the Olympic Games at CBC. The swimmer ended in fourth place of the women's race at 4x200 m relay free style
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "drawed like a stink" during the race and "exploded."
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the women's relay finals at 4x200 meters free style he began to spew his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "survivor" to the CBC commentary team, said, among other things: "The little 14 - year - old from China gave up, you fool."
Too much excitement, pulled like a smell, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay race in time 1:57.79 - that is, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to finish China.
The audience in Canada quickly began to call online and were appalled by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Did the announcer say on CBC that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "exploded"????
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay race at 4x200 meters free style was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism came from all sides on Twitter and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live commentary and said: "We apologize for the commentary on the performance of the swimmer who escaped on the air. "
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The CBC eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and inserted their apology in response for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about commentator MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement.
Honestly, she regrets the words being spoken, she shouldn't have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon Byron MacDonald apologized on live TV and tried to explain his comment by claiming that he did not want her to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the air from the Olympics at the CBC station.
"I meant the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say that I didn't mean any disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark offended by a woman who shamelessly tried her underwear in the middle of the store
When a woman took off her clothes to try her underwear on the sales area in the middle of Primark, the shoppers weren't sure which way to look.
To make things worse, she tried to fit her size, took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and eventually tried four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
A Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman tried her panties before returning them to the shelves
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at that time, said that the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything. "
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She was standing in the middle of the store, taking her panties off the shelves, taking off her own tights and panties and putting them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, cheeky like a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at how she took her panties off again, and apparently she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching -- not even thinking about the person who might buy the panties she tried."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: "The idea of someone wearing panties that someone else was wearing and not being cleaned.
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she left, I collected the things that she apparently tried to pull from the sale - which is also the only right thing. "
"I'd be terrified of bringing home new panties and finding out another woman was wearing them, taking them off and not being washed."
Primark said: "Primark knows about the incident that occurred in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9. "
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to defend against weapons attack using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this Dailymail.com video, it could be a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York City to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly take advantage of the rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from behind.
If he comes near you from behind, he says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn to see your attacker and "have a clear shot track."
You will then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows into the groin, and while the attacker is writhing in pain, you wriggle the gun out of his hand, hit the main one in the face and start retreating while you keep the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man from the front approaches you, it's similar to a technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put force into the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then wriggle the weapon out of its grip and start retreating while still pointing at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you can see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of an ambush - unless you're the Grand Master of Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to a hard test - licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, licked the euro banknote with his tongue, the Piccadilly Circus railing, the flush button on the train toilet and the Russian public phone.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
However, the experiment based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, but perhaps in the kitchen sink there is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals throughout his journey around Europe about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left nothing worse in his mouth than a taste.
Ian Wright was famous for testing the resistance of his bowels around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public railings at train stations to flushing
In the film he made about it, he says: "I didn't care much about my health since I was a child, and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to worm eating and muddy water. "
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused were dirty public bathrooms in Russia.
After a simple luminometer swab showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia refused to lick after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the ugliest thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting here.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something to watch with passion and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and we have brought more detailed information through this document to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think a great sense of humor appears in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I asked him to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film. "
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we licked some of those dirty things."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 according to which 84 percent of respondents mainly associated lactic acid with gastric and intestinal health and 58 percent of respondents claimed that at least occasionally they were using products containing added lactic acid.
The family of socially needed before eviction destroyed the municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of socially needy people left £50,000 in damage to their community home after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, the landlords were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, floor covering was torn, garbage was lying all over the floor and the walls were painted.
The family has already moved out and is believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing issues at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about saving the house.
She said, "It was a nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There's a lot of circumstances to consider, because this property is probably going to go into consciousness like "not such a nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
A few have three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and the police have said that the horror of the family was the street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon (47), whose name was stated on the lease contract, was in June sentenced for antisocial behaviour.
Smelling trash was found in several rooms in a house that may be torn down.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, there was a ripped floor covering
Neighbors say they were seen on the street fighting, and people called the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house by force this week after they received an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed eviction with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said: "They didn't care about anyone at all. "
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, they can't be counted.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the manager of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said that the family couldn't cooperate with local authorities.
Family lived in the house for 20 years, police were regularly summoned to the house
Garbage and old toys were lying in an overgrown part of the municipal house.
He adds: "It is a shame that the tenant could not accept responsibility for her own conduct and for her family's behaviour. Eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to the witness had to frighten her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors and at the same time carry a message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Contaminated mattress, which after eviction remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove piles of garbage that have been dumped around the house.
In 2014, she conducted a raid in the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth after their eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
The police say they're going to try to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases.
Angela Crow of the Denova and Cornwall police said that eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
Den's and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low flight of military jet aircraft over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun rays in Aveir, Portugal, were scared to death
The plane of the Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew up incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight, and insisted that safety was not compromised.
The moment the low-flying jet fell over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists were panicked.
The dramatic footage shows how a military plane gets almost at the touch of the sunshine people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet aircraft engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who published videos of a dramatic flyover on social networks, said: "The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to collapse. "
Nuno Arroja adds: "I surfed, and I really thought a plane would fall on my head. "
Tourists on the beach in Aveira were appalled when a low-flying plane appeared out of the darkness.
The Portuguese military air force today declared that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight in order to identify the fishing boat off the coast and had to withstand low because it was the only way to check the boat.
The aircraft allegedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the air force insists that the safety of the people was not compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four victims on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today declared that the pilot had to fly low due to the dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half the service providers do not comply with the law.
Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found this during the second quarter checks.
According to her, funeral services do not most often inform survivors of their prices or issue written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The CHOI imposed 41 fines for this in the total amount of CZK 73,000.
Today, her spokesperson Jiří Fröhlich informed about this.
Inspectors found error at 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed upon.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It concerned packaging for urns, candle covers and vases which were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"As there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiz Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that the family learned about her death in the Syrian Rakka a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during the Russian air strike in the Raktka, which is the bastion of the group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One person wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that they will discourage people from ever making decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
Sultana's family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria - and widowed within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton gets elected, she'll keep Garland as the Supreme Court candidate.
The Senate leader for the Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says that she believes that the candidate for the presidential election for the Democrats Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the senate majority of Mitch McConnel says that the person who will replace the late judge of the Supreme Court will elect the future president.
During the conference call on Thursday, Reid said that he believed that Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's spokesperson later said that he didn't directly talk to Clinton about whether or not she would nominate Garland and that he was just speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to swing a boat by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chairman of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's appointment are the "servers" and the "boys" of the Republican candidate for Donald Trump's presidency.
He said Trump didn't fit in with the office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are for both women and men.
The Treats magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer on the 2017 calendar inspired by the Pirelli calendar from the 1970s.
But instead of known celebrities revealed, NU Muses is trying to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from Playboy's old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We must return to displaying timeless and classic nudity, when women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photos of a woman's body," Shaw said in a press release for the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where's vinyl going: who really buys record records?
Vinyl loves lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to wrap up the comment section with hard notes under the pseudonym No AllLonelyMenIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so many discussed resurgences of gramophone records are linked not to the boom of millennials who want to enjoy the originality of possessing a physical object, but to the nostalgia of middle-aged age.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It is not really a hoarding enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy phonograph records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are more like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, I would be watched by a camera going out on a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gestured widely. Then I would stop, pull my hands out and say something authoritarian, like, "Let's take a look at it."
So let's take a look.
While his charm and charm slowly fade from Soho's heart - buildings once occupied by independent vendors - are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confections and office supplies - some fantastic specialized record shops still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'll stand close to the various men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional state is.
Stuart (55), a Glasgow native I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an appointment in London this afternoon to check out shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about 3 or 4,000 recordings.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture upstairs (the photo was sent to me by e-mail, I didn't follow him all the way home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy record records that he couldn't afford when they came out originally and buys again what he sold in his youth and didn't have a dime.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12 and I was too young to get them back then," he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves, adding: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many customers she meets fit the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old record records back.
According to my conversations, people were mostly getting rid of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record records and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy their record back," he says.
That could explain the boom of phonograph lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of gramophone records?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you will find a pleasant association of people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the system of contactless payments.
Some phonograph fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and decide for the well-known environment of phonograph covers, things that trigger memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, I do, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We are all like their social workers!" responds the coworker from a pile of record records.
In April, the ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it yet.
According to the survey, 41% of the enquired gramophone has never been used, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records do not have a gramophone.
At this point in the report, he probably seemed really concerned about going through a pile of bossa nova compilations.
The concept of "trophe" and revival of interest is something Jonny (42) noticed at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can display it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It's more about the product page than the music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a Gramophone."
Those are younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into this.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are couples of 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores used to - from speakers instead of pulling jazz echoes the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to tell when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) takes a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various gramophone records at a discount.
She's one of those guys who looks at window windows rather than spends feverishly.
She says she doesn't make much money, so there's no way she's collecting record records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but record players have their magic... 'sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I'm pretending to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls flocking around Polaroid cameras right now, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
On the left there is a staircase whose wall is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's phonographs: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of record records.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are only for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's purely a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for another, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic area where there is probably more time and money than in other areas is also the one where the most spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl certainly is.
But while, according to my findings, YouGov's results seem accurate - at least in record stores, they do not take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and lovers that exist in actual, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, going through recordings and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV host hiding behind the back of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video reporting
According to scientists, Greenland's shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years old and measures five metres
The court in France refused to tear down trades in the jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting, sell tea for 50 cents in temporary restaurants or basic meals for several euros.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that places must be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in court stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-supported associations and other groups do not provide an addition to food for growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Argumentable makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 temporary shops, but stated that the objections of Prefect Calais were "quite understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants have a much greater role to play than merely serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions. "
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was the camp cafe, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a nonprofit organization and which offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the "child's" cafe.
Guardian received a letter saying that closing a coffee shop "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old. "
Charity organizations Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals over the summer increased to over 9,000 - the most ever in the whole time.
He thought he was dead.
Ulch is resurrecting himself and the volleyball Usti.
"From March I could normally train," he reported at the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was in Korea University, I didn't know I had any problems with blood.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
It hurt me. No one found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when the weather's working or changing.
But nothing to limit me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
I didn't know I had an embolism last summer at the Wooden Tournament, and I couldn't move there at all.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was completely finished for five more days.
I really thought I was dead in Hardwood, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some problems with the blood, that I need to keep an eye on myself when I go somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
Only when I wanted to get back to Příbram's preparations last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been physically preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock, I'm better physically than I was before.
What do you expect from Usti?
I look forward to it, the gang looks good, I know most guys.
I'm curious about two more strangers coming.
I hope we can sit humanly so that we can fit together.
Will you pick up Ústí?
There was a reputation for being beaten up, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now the second.
There's a new team in Ústí. There's only a few players left.
It was the last in the extralize, so there's a lot of room to improve.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see who's gonna be beaten up after the first rounds, we won't.
Is coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's experienced and he's experienced a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last.
But my arrival wasn't connected to his, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one, and it was agreed to work here.
I'm not gonna say the name.
Eventually, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for dozens of years, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to cheer, and I like to get an opportunity on a not-so-high-end team.
I've been in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is more challenging than being on the sixth team right now because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's already training Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And we used to have a few conversations there, sometimes we sat together after the games, so we've already known each other as friends.
We beat them three to one, and immediately at the start of summer preparation in Ústí I spilled it on him.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a charmer.
The American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are yet to arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting an American, he seems like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a record player, the one who makes it, so I should be communicating with everyone.
I was just checking on the players, I looked up online, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'll fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of record player number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm going to be 24 years old and I don't have the guts to take turns.
I'd rather be in the center of the action, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I was supposed to be a second record player and go full time on it. If something isn't done full time, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in Příbram, when Kusto couldn't make it as captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems, and he left.
We've been climbing up ever since, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, whose offspring I am, I took turns one and two.
Excellent year in Old Town, after which I had many offers and chose Příbram.
That's where Budejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish my season because of the embolism.
Now it's a fresh start.
Gold number 22.
The short location remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," laughed Phelps while having eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother cheered again in the auditorium, son Boomer this time quietly slept with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started to swim racing and in a few hours it'll be over, he said touched.
In the finals behind Phelps by nearly two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagina, who won a long position.
Bronz won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Cup.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (far away), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four games in a row.
After most of the race, another American Ryan Lochte and the home Thiago Perreira held the lead with Phelps.
While the gold defender in the final craulish 50 put on a crushing finish, they fell out of medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the position card he advanced to the finals of the race to 100 meters butterfly.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the signing double - after a hundred he won the double track in Rio.
In the finals, he left 37 hundredths of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, and the third was Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy's fifth in the last year's World Cup, he became a sign king in Rio.
From the imaginary throne he deposed Larkin, who had the same double succeeded at last year's World Championship.
But at the Olympics, he only won the medal now.
At the crawling hundred, Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared gold.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel's second after the relay silver.
Swimming gold was first African-American in history at OH.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them, and it gets to where I am, said touched Manuel.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-meter butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the two-hundred crawlers.
It wasn't until the sixth world record player, Australian Cate Campbell.
The Japanese Rie Kanet won the $200, for which it was the first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
It has no valuable metal or from the World Championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Julija Jefimov, who, in spite of the doping past, struggles with the hostility of viewers and opponents due to the start of the games.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
I'm so tired of it, she said Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was won only by a special panel of sports arbitrage CAS just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
Whether anyone likes it or not, or whether they have a different opinion, whether they turn to arbitration, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
Czechs had a special day.
It was only less than an hour before the game that they learned who they were up against.
They must have handled the tactical preparation with lightning.
And then, in unconventional time, a little court game number one started.
The first set didn't start well, then they got ahead of the opponents, but in the state of 19:19 they didn't make it through the end.
In the second they were clearly better and straightened out, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
Above all, a number of broken services meant losing 10:15 and saying goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," regretted Hermann.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end of the last balloon, I flew the income I had gotten used to before.
We lost a set, which was crucial.
In the next set we boarded them with an overview on the field, a different defense and pushed on the service.
There was a very bad serve in the tie break, and we took it down this side.
It was disappointing because we could defeat the Russians.
Sluková: Shame to start the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to download it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and the third one was the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was five points, and there we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in little backyard number one?
Sluková: Similar to China in the backyards.
Environment and atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, total silence, music wasn't playing, nothing was going on.
That was different from the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
How was the preparation for the game when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the game?
She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like we did for the other teams.
But Simon prepared tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
I don't think so.
We played at 10:30, but we didn't at 12:00.
A block of Russian Birlov in front of the playoffs at the OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in front of the playoffs at the OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since 10, we had the regime postponed earlier.
That was two more hours.
It's funny, I can't imagine another sport has athletes who have to perform their best at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've prepared as best we can.
We knew it would, but it's not exactly typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress of the group was our goal, it's okay, on the one hand.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I will sleep it off and from tomorrow I will only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big brother's here. First snooping SIM.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM from a local operator while staying in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for long-stay visas, who, for example, work in Thailand or get married there.
The Secretary General of the National Broadcasting Office and Telecommunication Commission Takorn Tantasith informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sale plan intended exclusively for foreigners was introduced by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The authorities intend to introduce new measures to enable their location to be monitored within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of preserving national security, which will allow foreigners to deal with crimes committed by them.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIM is intended to help expose persons who exceed the allowed length of stay.
In the case of sellers, within six months SIM intended exclusively for Thais should appear also special SIM for foreigners.
The function of monitoring will be different, which will be permanently switched on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function for SIM is not for Thais because we can always watch them easily," Tantasith added.
It must be added that in Thailand pre-pays are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires identification.
On the other hand, for several years, one operator gave free starting SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore are also considering implementing the same measure as Thailand.
There is currently a mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not imply for foreigners the obligation to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country know only relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM login to their network.
They know the telephone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so vast that most tourists will start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to supervise the movement of foreigners have been legally received by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the forthcoming system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents in connection with privacy protection.
In addition, police will need a court order to monitor a specific person if necessary.
Any abuse of the system will be punishable by an undetermined penalty.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
Moreover, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently recycled after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not logged on to the network, the number could be renewed after 15 days in the event of leaving Thailand.
The luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property care is provided by the trustees.
The condition was enough parking spaces and elevator in the house, which basically disqualified older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking floors, high energy performance, etc.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in Modern Apartment magazine.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with everyone's expert?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: the designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to match the interior according to the client's wishes.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us to reconstruct our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wished for a generous social-residential space with adequate background for a four-member family conceived as a modern but not cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and implement smart home control.
And, of course, the quality of the execution had to be guarded.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs including technical drawings and material samples, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some interior elements that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it is our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysuil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund that helped the architect to focus on our taste.
Also a combination of black, white and nut wood was the idea of an architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.We then checked together with visualization.
Were there any complications in the implementation of the original ideas you had to give up or, on the contrary, go to new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction site when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned were actually shadowing the surrounding buildings.
That's when we literally changed the layout overnight from scratch.
Granite was used on the kitchen line and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces filled with leather, such as the upholstery of the dining and bar chairs of Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you planning any changes, or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe it is a modern air interior, which primarily serves its purpose.
We are not planning changes, most of the modifications after moving took place in the plane of shielding and settling the terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when walnut wood shows us too delicate to house with a dog.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, the author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, therefore it was possible to complete a completely new layout solution and several other modifications.
For the interior is an important element of placing sun tunnels into the ceiling of the hallway and main toilets.
That's how we got daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications that was very beneficial for the whole apartment.
The pool and hot tub are also included.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where everywhere did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I moved around pretty much.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among people.
I felt like every Frenchman was so negative.
The people in France are negatively tuned in general, but lately it's gotten worse.
It's interesting that you're referring to negativism.
Because that's how some people judge Czech nature.
Believe me, compared to the French, you're not negative.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France because they don't see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big issue.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking through my fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for a job virtually anywhere else, and I've come across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I confess that I didn't know Prague at all.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, Dad even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I could do anything, dress in any way, and no one would judge me.
In France, someone keeps looking at you unpleasantly, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the Pražans care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After my job in Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then one friend and I started a website on which people offer and look for shared housing.
So far, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have here two very close friends, who are Czechs of half, and two friends of Czechs.
I must say that the other specifics of the Czechs are that they initially keep their distance.
He won't let anyone near his body.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it's pretty simple in Prague because everyone here speaks English.
Even in curfews or groceries.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little bit in English, I have no such need to learn a language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
There's an experience I can think of.
My manager, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
I'm pretty upset about that.
But that someone would have a problem with me being a Muslim, that's never happened to me before.
And even though a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, they'd call me names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I couldn't imagine anything like this happening in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
To me, people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists patronizing themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow up on the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met in Jiri's square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my fellow workers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, they learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
Sometimes people associate Islam with a woman's subordinate position.
How do you feel about that?
There's no way I feel subordinate.
Quite the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear any head covers.
Like a hijab?
And the most important thing to sign is the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a really principled Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal matter.
It depends on how she interprets it.
If you read the Koran, you should have your own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur'an saying that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from others, I said to myself, I am not the woman of the Prophet, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia where scarves are required, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
For now, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
I think Prague is the perfect city for this.
Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against violence.
Kozel's Fenchl wind in Rio was blown over by the yacht driver.
Friday's ride at sea in Brazilian Rio de Janeiro was released by the Czech yacht girl Veronica Kozelské Fenclové.
In Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure Češce's participation in the final ride.
You'll collect the packages like pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea is to use the planned routes for transporting shipments by TV director Matěj Liška and manager of Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea of inhaling life with three applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the National Transfer application in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities recorded in it, and we're going to expand the network.
In the Czech Republic we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data on how much you can transfer and how much you want for the package.
Someone may be asking for transport that day again.
When the route and delivery time are convenient, it is paired up and mutual notification comes to both.
That's when the chat room opens, where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register for each package to always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't tell how many registered routes and how many routes it takes to ensure that coverage is optimal and that each supply is paired with demand.
It's already working on the main moves, and it's logically easier than on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are building their trust, too, and they're finding out that no one's gonna run away with the package.
You haven't had to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users have the service after two months from startup?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6,000 people who make the roads.
That's what we think is a success, and we believe that there will be more.
Isn't the sender gonna wait too long?
We hope to be competitive for large conglomerates only because we are able to deliver it the same day and at a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you'll pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you pay a hundred or less, because that's the way somebody's already doing it.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We're hoping that's the way it's gonna be.
The market has huge potential, huge multinational carriers feed here, as well as the chain of trade, where everyone started shopping and gradually discovered that quality is not responsible for what they pay for.
Nobody wants to find a note in the mailbox saying they're supposed to pick up the package at the branch, first the day after 7:00.
That's when I needed the package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that won't piss anyone off and send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matej Liška (39).
Neither of them ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matej Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing Shippansee LTD, which uses scheduled travels between world metropolises, especially aircraft, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications such as MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The transfer application started to develop in December last year and released this May.
It is a local version of Shippansee modified for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to do all these applications, which one day joins in one.
In the Czech Republic they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
Shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you worried about working in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the limit of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, just another product.
It's clear to us that if it's successful and we go up with it, we'll be the next thorn in the eye through the gray economy.
But even though someone saves money and earns money, it is not intended to circumvent financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on the one hand or on the other hand, will be encouraged to tax his or her income if he or she makes a profit out of it.
What makes you think the ministry has such great potential?
The sender saves money and the ferry earns money or reduces the cost of the journey.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At a time of social networking that divides people, we'd like this one to bond.
Good stories can arise, and people are happy to help and share it with others.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys, or pills.
I think people have been missing a personal approach for a long time, and we're saying this app is people's service.
So how do you guarantee the courier won't escape with the package?
Each user of the application, together with registration, scans the ID card and lists a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give both service and man credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on the evaluation of senders.
We'll offer insurance, we'll match the details.
The courier guarantees the uninsured shipment in the event of loss or damage, but does not assume liability under criminal law for content if there is something illegal inside and does not know it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun in his trunk or ten kilos of hashish in a sealed package, he's taking criminal responsibility to senders.
Is there any risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, a traceable administrative authority, which will be the only one who will be able to consult it, and we ourselves are unable to see it, data are protected against abuse.
How much money does the courier get after successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender will charge several percent extra for providing contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent, because we want to push to the volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when it was actually delivered, the receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs, and as big as a bass of beer.
After that, there is no further restriction, and if anyone has a seat in the car, they can transport a fridge.
Plus the sender has the opportunity to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier sees what is required of him.
You don't even have to pack things unless you want to hide the contents.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
My friend had an idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention at the time.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational range that mainly targets passengers by plane.
At that point, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put my savings into it.
It took another year to develop before we started Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, we have focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to get used to the application, because it all had birth pain and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback, and we are not doing so much for the foreign market at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we're in no hurry, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in their own way upgrades.
I was transferred when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application by Mesík is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as I will transfer, but the difference is that as a courier, you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your phone.
We called the app for couriers who want to make a living with it, "Profi Mesík."
So somebody can make a big buck by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded by a taxi driver, student, mother on parental leave in Prague, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
Now that everyone's messing with these pokémons, they can pick this up exactly the same way.
You can see where there are jobs around town, come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and carry the shipment.
It's cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are still doing a web interface that will be crucial for companies to send shipments, filling out data about them on the web, or creating points on the map.
We are then able to use their services for example every month to face them.
Are you now full-time in the project?
It's bothering us, but we have it normally at work so that we can support and develop the project.
There's no strong multinational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other one jumped in with other suggestions and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage to take advantage of us not of the Czech market, but who should come with us to the global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will correct the second part and the solo game in it will be more colorful according to the first information than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of network struggle in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which besides running includes the possibility of using a fighting titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will include levels aimed precisely at skillful movement.
They will remind platformers and include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, running around walls, and rope slides are essential to overcome them.
At times, even enemies will have to be eliminated.
Maps resembling mazes and levels with special concepts will not be missing.
For example, it will be possible to lift the platforms and close the massive doors.
You will adjust the form of the battlefield.
As a result, the game's pace should oscillate between the furious action and the quieter moments to explore the unknown planet.
We're gonna play for Jack Cooper's pawn, dreaming of a pilot's career.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimosa will crash on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And he will not be indulgent in the wilderness.
Moreover, Lastimosa will suffer fatal wounds in the crash, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with getting the captain's titan operational.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's phone calls with the Titan will also be significant.
Players will be served as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time robot depersonalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if titanium lists all the injuries that Cooper is in danger of jumping in the planned jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was provided by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be assessed in two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions from the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Nordic Swedish company changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ publishing house in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and company name.
Nordic issued, for example, a Darksiders 2 Deathitive Edition or a Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 more games are created for the label and 13 of them have not yet been discovered by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a 20 - year - old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the start -- she obviously tried for a long time at first, then they got together.
He's a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she dated a guy like that before me.
She's totally into him.
In those first days, she even had a voice, a girlish, in love with a voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I was watching the whole thing.
He was out of work at 3:30 a.m. at the time, so she always left for shopping at 3:00.
She tried to at least see him every day.
Later, I found out they were meeting in his house, in his laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got my keys, he was determined to be caught there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife was mentally controlling me.
Soon I think she found out that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted.
And I actually did it.
Maybe I'm just such a loser.
At the time, the neighbors suggested that they knew about it.
I was such a jerk I never asked them what to do.
I was worried if it all snapped, it'd be bad.
Only the daughter suspected that it would happen to everyone in the family.
So I've always put it off, on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to see if I needed any help in the laundry room.
He went with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was seeing my wife, and that all the signs were there.
I asked him what he would say.
He was standing there, crouching his shoulders, looking into the ground and not saying a word.
Then, at that time, I also met his wife on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me either.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never really been going anywhere who's having a hard time getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about getting a divorce.
I kept counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this, and life would go on.
But it wasn't like that.
And I've basically never dealt with it all.
I still have it in me today.
I used to let her know that a lot, but I ended up giving it up for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more my wife than my housekeeper's.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's a hard worker.
I always think she was trying to make me have no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice too.
But sometimes I want to pet her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I can see that he still loves him. He's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
Even then, when it started and I took it very badly, I told her once that I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree to it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of their beliefs," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to make sure that only the spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, when the money often comes from preachers vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it should have contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, though, she was hit by internal contradictions, and she never worked properly.
"It is a total failure," Valls said.
Former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, known as a supporter of the secular state, will probably lead the new foundation.
In France there are about 2500 mosques and prayers, about 120 of them serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled around 80 Islamic clergymen from the country and are considering this step for several dozen others.
German police also intervened this week against jihadist clergymen.
Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them was operating a space where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on a new institution in France, which will replace a dysfunctional foundation, went on fire.
Everything was accelerated by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks − ensuring financing mosques from domestic sources and also overseeing imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will obtain funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, namely for meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for granting permits.
Some of the money would then go into the foundation's budget.
The EUR 10 to 20 contribution could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Each year, about 30,000 of them leave France for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have undergone educational programs at universities there should be active in French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed twenty since December and others will follow," said Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown shooter at a shopping mall in Zaragoza, North Spain, reports the Independent.
The shooting took place after the wife and daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes Independent.
My wife was taken to the hospital by an unharmed daughter. An ambulance had to arrive for a man in critical condition.
The crime occurred around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes Independent that the motive was probably unsolved by the recent divorce of both partners.
Asparagus rolls, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes to light, well digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our appetites and our heads.
And so the summer garden smells of grilled neck, belly, pork chops.
Nothing too healthy, not too easy, sometimes except salad or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecue is economical for time and dishes, plus it's a social matter and no one has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to making delicacies, which special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or suffocate.
And they will also contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-absorbed grifts are enough to make the preparation fun and food itself a real exotic delicacy.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even more time-consuming cooking and coldening of rice falls away.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment and then all that matters is the cook's imagination, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There's no eyelash like an eyelash.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisine is that raw materials are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real pink ginger ginger has a unique spicy spicy and delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it mixes from several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
Just buy a bag of appropriate size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and cough or flu resistance, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within various festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are also very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America as a "help" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed into them in a similar way as in the foil.
The banana leaf also gives the food a specific flavor.
We can buy them in shops with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
But choose only green leaves, and thus healthy - uncracked and spotless.
Similarly, the preparation of wakame, sesame and sesame oil salad is easy.
It can be bought frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, will probably know especially the eyelash of the nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed from which it is produced by chopping, pressing and drying so-called nori leaves - that is, plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame − a dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido − also eats fresh and dried and is as popular as a nori algae.
By the way, who doesn't know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women have used it since ancient times to recover after birth.
And in any case, this eyelash has almost miraculous effects.
Cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents hair graying and is literally charged with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as spices, for example, to season rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to liquefy in the water, then rinse, put into boiling water, and cook for half a minute.
It then cools down in ice water, cuts out the middle ribs and further adjusts, like a favorite salad.
But buying it already finished, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all that remains is to wrap the roll with easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
Unless you resist and throw in an extra grilled belly.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done in one and two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g cucumber, 60 g wakame algae and 60 g sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chili sauce, 20 g mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nut.
Let's get the rolls ready first.
We'll soak rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we remove it and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, we boil our asparagus sprouts briefly, after about three minutes we put them quickly cool down into ice water so they don't lose color.
Put the vegetable filling on the paper and pack it.
We prepare the filling with white radish, carrots and pickles, which we cut into fine noodles, mix with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped cilantro, mix thoroughly and paste on rice paper.
Put asparagus shoots on banana leaf, add rolls and finish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, mango slice, sprinkle with black sesame and add some pine nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in seven rugby, selection Fiji takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in seven rugby ended with a devastating trail on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated the British at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at 43:7 high in the final match on Thursday night.
The Fijians demonstrated a masterpiece in processing, landfill, evasive, support game, running on the line and brutal forces - and gained gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an uncharted consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third on a given day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic 7th Rugby tournament, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Winning the South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals on the same day, maybe she's frozen in the finals.
But Fiji, in its form, would defeat a 15-man team in full health.
Probably will not be a comfort to the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon, is the head coach of the Fijians.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
That's where they lost the only one.
This defeat may hurt, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began magnificently, the British' penetration reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a bunch of buses in motion and World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau appeared around the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only the Fijians slowed down.
At the seventh minute, he threw Jasa Veremalu's touchdown into the right corner, and the British were losing 17.0.
Nakarawa added another after the return and the clock still had more than 1 minute left ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravovou then penetrated the wobbly British and rushed to the line where he scored.
After conversion to state 29:0 followed a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning the graduation.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes after halftime, and the Fijans stopped... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Yosua Tuis' brilliant interplay went on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown into the left corner to raise an 36-7. However, the match had long been won by the Pacific Islanders and their fans on the gallows sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyful attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments Mata Viliame made another attempt to win the Fijans sweet.
There was a whistle, the Fijans hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely beaten.
Prior to that same day, Fiji in the semifinals defeated Japan 20:5 and Great Britain conquered South Africa in a close semifinal - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of England's 15th team, secured a victory - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race inspired the fight of the cancer coach
You won't find more emotional gold on these peas - and that's something to say.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoo.
Although there were two of them sitting at the oars, there were three voices in the boat. When the boat whirled on the surface towards the second Olympic gold in a row in the female pair race, there was still the voice of the still present coach Robin Williams in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their dominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying across the water with the elegance of the swan - does not reflect the nature of victory entirely.
For every gold medal of rowing, there is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which means difference piece by piece, and no hands were more helpful than a coach's hand, who didn't know 30 months ago if he was going to live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I had this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It'll change your mind a little bit.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
Happiness for the whole trio was that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, and thus shorten the blackout to a minimum - if that's what we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own restlessness.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery regiment, who's been on a mission in Afghanistan, said: "I've been down with emotions this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much. "
Again, it emphasizes how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin did.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
We wouldn't be anyone without Robin, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
The couple put on a staggering rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At the very moment, we were focused.
Helen yelled, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve anything fabulous.
We weren't looking forward to tonight's fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
A couple will take a year to think before they decide what's next.
Glover is getting married next week, her future is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about this," she said.

Prison?
More like a free ride, says the Taximafie hunter Rubeš to the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate official in Prague are defendants, as the Czech Republic said.
You've done a series of reports in which you've exposed fraudulent practices and those to be in the group that's going to stand trial.
You've faced a few unpleasant fights with exposed actors over this.
How much is the report for you on the prosecution of organized group members turning point?
I thought there might be a trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they're supposed to give them back so they're gonna drive all the people for free.
That's a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, another delivers pizza, and one totally bailed.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an appropriate rate?
I generally have a prison problem.
I consider this a bad punishment.
Locking someone up, especially in that case, is nonsense.
People like that should return the companies they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they did this by destroying our country's name and stealing from people.
So let them make a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to pick up garbage, they get a car and they drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get probation eventually, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and then at the University of Tomáš Bata in Zlín.
It belongs to people who started with viral videos and videos in the Czech Republic directly for the web.
He works as an editor for Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, now he is preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubeš advises those who prefer to avoid services in Prague and which he recommends to use without fear.
Previously he shot series with names How to do, City of Fraud?, Life in luxury, A quite! and Prague vs. Money.
They're referred to as organized groups in the prosecution.
The police followed her for months.
Can such a network of fake cab drivers be described as a mobster?
They're cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Godfather.
It's more like mobsters - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
Just that they're guarding each other's ladders.
Prague is all split up.
I tracked down that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lazne (disco club)
Everyone's just keeping an eye on their little place, and every group is organized somehow.
It's probably a complex network.
The defendants, however, are together only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate official who warned the driver about the controls.
As you say, undesirable effects have not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage among the Prague cheaters in the taxi service according to your estimate is it?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryjáček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and drives people.
Last time I rode with him, he asked me to do seven hundred for three kilometers.
His police didn't hold him for some reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The same situation is, however, also in other locations of Prague.
The prosecution of seven people is therefore difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague nesvar, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's no use at all.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, it is true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform at the same places you showed in the reports, that is, at the Charles Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and break orders every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
He's not even a cat anymore, but he's completely indifferent.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if they are part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, it is, and it will always be, for the centre of Prague to improve.
And even if I feel like I need to get a little better, I'm gonna keep doing this.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't settle for that.
But it's not, there's more, of course.
Are you still trying to confront them right in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test drives, and I have to say, it's still bad.
I just caught a cab driver last week, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was CZK 56 (he used a decimal trick).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came and this cab driver was so cute, he was still going to see the cops and he asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taxi meter glued the decimal point and robbed the tourists by 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the insolence of cheating taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged senseless sums for a short ride?
Their impudence is still incredible.
What happened to that cabbie, bringing in 56 crowns?
The cops sent him away with the fact that they couldn't discuss him on the spot because he issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in that courtroom too (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
On one side there's gonna be a cab driver with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court's decision, the magistrate must not use secret taxi service vehicle recordings as evidence in court.
When I filmed the episodes of their scams, the cab drivers themselves pointed me out to this precedent.
I'm the one who always wanted to use the footage for the story.
Are you worried that this fact might even protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no cab driver could drive for six or ten crowns a kilometer because he wouldn't make a living.
You were talking about a decimal trick that, especially in front of foreign clients, underwater taxi drivers are moving.
Is it still up to date, or are they worried about this trick after publishing your reports to continue to use?
I think we've popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was driving a cab driver the other day, bragging in front of me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that from the side of the meter glued to black cardboard.
When I asked him what he had there, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If a cabbie-cheater didn't work too well, can a court-martial with their colleagues be a warning to them?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You talked about finding a way to cheat, you said.
I don't think anything can stop them.
But somebody can push them out of those places.
And these are fair cab drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
I have to say from my experience that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are lucky to prevail.
But do they want to go against those who corrupt the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they miss um.
He doesn't know much about it, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to the proposal for a global restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they really wanted.
One day they said they weren't protesting Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and created only the best possible ad for Uber.
How do you evaluate the Prague City Council's approach to solving the problem of overpriced fare?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The Magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole that was leaking information, which means that the taxi department had been doing their job for years completely useless.
I'm hoping that the clerk gets every last check he's made to realize what he's done.
That's the worst part about it.
I was even on a check drive with him, which I discovered only then from their schedule.
It's been months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, especially with foreign viewers, which is actually what the series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them the videos.
And then when we walk down the Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people that are seen in the footage are really standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
Seriously.
I'd put a hick around them so people would look at them.
The Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need to?
Sure.
I drive with services that I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are many dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me, "Wow, you've got a lot of guts."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
The cabbie's fraudulent practices were reported in 2005.
The former mayor Pavel Bém set off in the same year for a control ride in disguise as an Italian tourist and was cheated by two hundred on his first attempt.
But the editor, Rubeš, had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him for a ride from the Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square CZK 820, which is approx. CZK 195 per kilometre, as the reporters calculated.
The Prague City Hall has set a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the recorded reports: for example, a two-mile journey from Paris to Joiner's Street cost a tourist 400 CZK.
Dear rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
They charge 600 crowns for the ride to the Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers.
Marble is washed mainly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Impurities go well from it, although sometimes dirt has to be put down by a scalpel, it has to be pulled out of the folds.
It's not easy, and it doesn't go fast. Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov, Hájích, brought her work closer.
Hat down in front of her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, which requires countless climbs and climbs.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and easy on the working environment," she said.
It's not her first restoration job in Frydlantland.
Thanks to it, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Frydlant Town Hall were restored, as well as the statues of St.Marie Magdalena in Zátiší, St.John Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Pieto in Frydlant Okružní Street, Mariánské polo in Frýdlant or atlants in the facade of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the deposits of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against the fall and shift; either they will be anchored into the wall or to each other.
They are also expected to be treated and preserved.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then the gilding of the inscriptions on marble tablets will begin with pure slice gold," said Frýdlant Sobotová, Official of the State Heritage Service.
There's no record from the past that the tombstone has been repaired.
At a closer look, they take the holes, drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're remains after the gravestone decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish raid during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
Literally, the tombstone was brushed, marked by Sobot.
In the Church of the Finding the Holy Cross, restorers with a slight exaggeration are at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that were underwater, restore the baptist, wall paintings in the tomb, and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to embark on a stained glass in the future," said Sobotová.
The church is in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration works on the reconstruction of the Redernov tombstone will total 128 thousand crowns.
They will be financed from subsidies, the city will not put any money into this part of the reconstruction.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the regional round of the competition Historic City of 2015, the remaining 28,000 crowns is then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, specified by Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the prize to restore the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments on selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech Capital Market (PX) within one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in markets.
Who'd have known it by the beginning of the year?
The American index S&P500, which went through 12% of the corrections in February, is now at a new historical peak and has added 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
This confirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks that have always achieved theirs in the long run.
In a situation where US stocks are at historical peaks, volatility is again disappearing, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown happily and fearlessly due to the quantitative easing of the US central bank and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable below 12 percent.
And I wish I didn't.
Although the Fed markets continue to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England has also joined the party, which will buy 70 billion pounds of bonds in the next six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low yields below and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market, and the situation in China is stabilizing and brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue to remain in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted to do this difficult work of experienced policy, said European Commission chief Juncker, when the French policy (really experienced, because it was so many different transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find) appointed the principal negotiator of the European Commission the conditions for the departure of Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's selection blew out the hopes that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek the form of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rocky European federalist.
He hates the Great Britain.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of the reform of European banking law.
He took it as he alone could: the hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
He co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and opposed everything that comes from the City Financial Center in London, he pushed legislation through the overwhelmingly harsh regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, relentless and apparently ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How to remember in this context the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and ability of empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is why Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies today.
Too bad Juncker hasn't learned his lesson from Václav Klaus - at least in this.
It would be for everyone's sake!
The Putin earthquake?
The Kremlin Master released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the presidency on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
The Russian media informed about this, referring to the announcement of the Kremlin press service.
Putin indicated that Ivanov was being released at his own request.
At a meeting that carried Rossija 24 television station, the president said that he was coming out to meet Ivanov's wishes when taking up office, that he wanted to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the President's administration, which Ivanov's current representative Vajno will now lead, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is referred to as one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, served as Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the seat of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, however, stated that the length of stay at the head of the administration of the head of state was actually a record player.
He stayed in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that 11 people had already been replaced in 25 years since her establishment.
Both Kvit and Deblist Uncle and Saffara aren't gonna play the finals.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have been able to turn into a final turnout.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her fight, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitová was followed by Czech deblists Šafářová and Strýcová.
While the Slayers of the Williams sisters reached after the win in the first set, they wasted two hundreds of them, and the Russians eventually captured the set in a short game.
The second set then lost a ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning programme in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Ondřej Synek won his semifinals with an overview, when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia even after he relaxed at the end almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, said the Son.
Unlike him, his opponents had to fight for progress.
So it's taken away some of their powers, which could make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the rower of the Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topink-Knapková didn't follow in Snyk's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower took the fourth position in today's semifinals, and on Saturday it will start in the B finals and fight for the 7th to 12th place.
Gold from London won't defend it like that.
I didn't make it to the finals at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I drove a good race, and I put everything I could into it.
The opponents were just better, they bowed down to Topink Knapk.
She fought to the end and believed that she would make it to her fourth games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the target.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could advance from that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could advance through Austrian to the finals.
Unfortunately, today was the race of life, said the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained young shooter Filip Nejchal, who failed to get out of the qualification for the second time, this time small marks in the lie.
That's where he took 33rd place.
The Russians were best qualified.
From the first rungs advanced Sergei Kamensky with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
The prick's shot was worth 620.5 points.
The program in Rio was also for the first time spoken by athletes, among them Czech engravings Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová belongs to 11th place after the second event of the Olympic competition, Czech record player Eliška Klučinová is 22.
She runs the British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, which jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the continuous second Belgian Nafissata Thiam.
Both took care of historically best height performance within the seven-boy.
They tried to jump another 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Looking away from the absurdity of this question: German society has gone through a deep self-esteem, whereas Russia has not.
In both great Eurasian nations, dictators appeared in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and awful came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed largely to the 94 million victims of communism, reported by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was everyday individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis wiped out about 6 million Jews in an inhuman way, and I estimate the total victims of World War II to be 60 million.
The Germans and Soviets performed atrocities in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and in the USSR, not just a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or simply by cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany immediately ended the war came the denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, "Daddy, Grandpa, why were you involved in such atrocities?
How could you!
This brought true reflection and recovery of society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to add back Alsace-Lotrinsko or someone - to the revanš - to the military attack - that's what everyone will recognize.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no major reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The politics of Putinian Russia are the revans, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of their own people are of no value to anything.
Beat yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the rise in tension around Crimea?
Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who benefit from the growth of tension?
After a long period of relative peace, relations between Ukraine and Russia have again deteriorated.
The Ukrainian Party's castle became the peninsula of Crimea, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, the news from both hostile parties contradicts and is difficult to independently verify, so we have the opportunity to just think about the old familiar question of who does it benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces in Russia has already come from the case of the pilot Savchenko known to have been kidnapped in Russia.
If we move on to the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from a deterioration in the situation surrounding Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
Escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further strengthening sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the background of the immigration crisis in Europe has led to a decline in attention from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost total credit to its inhabitants when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have gone bankrupt long ago without generous financial injections from the EU and mainly from the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to resolutely draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of force forces once again want to prove to be strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It is only to hope that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both enemy sides and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria showed inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation rates in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0,8% compared to the previous period (August 2014 - July 2015.
The index of consumer prices in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0% and monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in travel of the following consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The U.S. Secret Service has been tracking Russian hacker attacks for a year.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the party headquarters of the Democrats.
But no official report mentions Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied a share of the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would reveal that the US secret services are monitoring the hack attack, and the way they do it and the resources they use could be revealed.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were said to have been involved in the attack.
The new Cyber Security Advisory Board
The surveillance material of the Russian trail was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight members of Congress, called the eight gang in the United States, were informed of public officials.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democrats' chairmen in both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of Congressional Defense and Security Committees.
The Acting Head of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that she was setting up an Advisory Board on Cyber Security to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Alberto.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer's initiative on health problems after consumption of food Salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague health care professionals carried out checks in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstek.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, to which the customer pointed out, was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was collected.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for man - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and man-eating live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Šticha.
Customers are very sorry for the problems with this branded product.
We have immediately withdrawn the lot from the sale and for preventive reasons we have withdrawn all other lots of this item.
The failure took place on the side of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, said to the Newsperson Alberta Barbora Vanko.
If a customer buys this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and gets the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrnata.
The health care professional informed the Prague and Central Bohemia Veterinary Administration about the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to the server Safenessgrocery.cz, people can get sick of anisakiosis after eating a parasite, which will develop severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, told the Czech News Agency.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after consumption of poorly heat-treated fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians have currently checked salmon and the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemia Region.
Three of the five samples examined had a parasite in them.
Shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expedited, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packages.
Currently there is downloading of unsold supplies of the product from the stores, Petr Pejchal told the Czech News Agency on Friday.
Immediately after finding positive samples, veterinarians banned sending other products from storage.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian air raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage to a jihadist, who was soon killed, came sobering.
The expected paradise of the Caliphate has turned to hell for British girls on earth from which there was no escape.
The girl, according to her relatives, was in contact with her sister Halima.
She made repeated calls to Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without thinking about it, quoting The Telegraph's late girl's family lawyer Tasnim Akunjee.
The last leads led to Rakka, the last time a girl called from there.
Then there was only a report of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they were hoping to reunite with their former student.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house she was staying in leveled in May with the air raid, reported British ITV News.
TV added that the bomb was probably dropped by a Russian plane attacking the IS bastion in Syria.
You would bear the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) was thinking of fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape, and according to available information, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think (Kadiza) interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take a risk, meaning according to BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15 - year - old friends from Shamima Begum and Amira Abasa left last February 17th.
The only thing they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they headed to Gatwick Airport and from it through Turkey to the territory controlled by IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadiz back.
You'd bear the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could to get her to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught alone, the lawyer added.
According to him, the only positive thing is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who will be fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many times when people went there, they realized how things were going there, they understood how much different it was from the promises of propaganda from the Islamic State, and they wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadis' classmates is unknown.
But since they have also been silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the regional center and the residence of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held in the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts resided were pitiful and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them are successful.
That is why city representatives have decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
It has not been in operation for a long time, it has been closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889 since smaller corrective facilities were costly for operation and did not pay much.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
The prison opened for the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions existed in them.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning brands on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked up in one of the cells, mostly for a memorial photograph, or for a sense that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish locations where it allegedly haunts.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already set out there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
Such a night, however, will come to £300, which is roughly CZK 9500.
Apart from this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts to great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The "Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a character that comes out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake shall be published immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism of the accusation that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So this week, when she offered the users a filter that made their eyes sloppy, their teeth crooked, and their faces bloated, some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon -- "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated issues pointed to a greater problem for society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it and news and outrage spread quickly and Snapchat said the next day that he had cancelled his post.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a display of accounts to animé characters, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes in action.
The others refused to compare it to the animations.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, e-mailed that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that "it's hard to argue against comparison of the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn to the contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from meeting rooms in corporations to Holywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And the vast number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu on Thursday in an interview, "it's very hard to ignore these things today, as it was before."
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview on the phone, she said that she believes that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the vast white, totally male leadership of the company and the article ended with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity between employees and colored people at the moment when these things are decided," said Zhuová, who has Chinese-American origins, "or colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to talk."
Other observers share her view - a complaint Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees with the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesperson, the company recently accepted a recruiter who should focus on the underrepresented population and internal inclusion management.
Zhuová adds: "I wonder if they really need other users who can say it's not okay, " with their account being canceled.
Army officers distorted intelligence on IS, says the parliamentary committee
The Parliamentary Committee stated in a report issued on Thursday that officers from the United States Central Command changed intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events from the country provided.
According to a preliminary report by the working group drawn up by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on the Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence and the Defence Sub-Committee, "extensive dissatisfaction" has been identified among central intelligence analysts according to which their superiors have changed their assessment of US efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military central office in Tampa, Florida, overseeing US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report states: "The outputs of intelligence services approved by Centcom's superiors usually offered a more positive picture of the US's anti-terrorist efforts than confirmed by the facts on earth, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community. "
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a wrong analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican of California.
Failure in the Centcom leadership goes all the way to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the Obama administration's top officials ordered the reports to be altered, the report states that the analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the Central Staff, statements and statements from the Congress were significantly more positive than what the events were," the report states.
For example, a representative of Centcom publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said Mr Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party of Kansas in his statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking personnel of the US Central Staff intelligence services handled the outputs of the staff intelligence services in order to counter the threat of the IS in Iraq.
The Republicans assembled a task force after they learned about analysts' concerns about the fact that intelligence information regarding the Islamic State is being manipulated.
A report published on Thursday must be followed by further investigation.
There is another investigation conducted by the Ministry of Defence Inspector General in Centcom's intelligence services.
Democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process to compile an assessment of information on IS and Iraqi security forces," said Czech representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Democrat representative.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "leaded to distorting the output of intelligence services, " damaging the morale between analysts and" inadequately taking dissenting views into account. "
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House has tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to "the draft or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published at the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation into the Pentagon Inspector General, which was initiated following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-Lieutenant Patrick Evans, spokesperson for the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report because the Inspector General's investigation is still ongoing.
However, he stated that "the experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental questions of national security. "
The investigation has implications beyond the question whether the Americans led the bombing in Iraq and Syria are successful (a statement that is now declaring an increasing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to sincerely assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic State news has reflected conflicts for more than ten years, when Centcom analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the opposition of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the intelligence services of the Islamic State.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements on the contrary, air strikes against the Islamic State refineries did not weaken the financial resources of the terrorist group significantly, as the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
In September, The Times reported that the findings were not transmitted outside the Central Staff.
Centcom commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized for the past year after many legislators found the Senate's testimony too positive by assessing the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The US won ground hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be a decisive match in the UK team.
Katie Bam in a match against Japan, which ended in a 6:1 victory, scored three goals and only one day later, for the American women's team of ground hockey, scored the first two goals of the game, in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a success worth remembering, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure if she ever succeeded in such a thing.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who write down their goals.
But he knows this: Americans in the Olympic tournament lead to 4:0 games and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the six teams will end up in the first and second place.
The first-place team avoids the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group.
Whatever the end of Saturday's game, the Americans, with their surprise ride here, caused a stir, four years after they ended up among 12 teams at the London games.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and she took a hockey stick for the first time in her hand when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics escaped her because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012 when neither she nor the members of her team did well.
The next year, the Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," said Bamová.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by shooting a bekendem goal from nearby.
India joined the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then she slipped into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans into the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we are in a good place," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic fury
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make you feel persistent, indescribable, and biased about the exchange of competition and effort.
It's how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay pin, passed on to a swimmer, gymnast, and triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the grudge between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming lover of women with dimples in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be in the homes of the prime time between ads and sponsor spots if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in jumps on trampoline.
The Olympic Fire doesn't shine on all the competitions the same way.
Further from the center, a little in the shadows are sports that are not generally recognized: fire from air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always succeed in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the subtle charm of trampoline.
Even though jumps on a trampoline have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I have asked did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US never won a medal on trampoline jumps, and until 2012, none of the athletes made it to the finals.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will hug Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
Jumps on the trampoline have yet another bad luck, partly because the uninformed ear will seem more suitable for the Clown University than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but I'm just an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential - comics vibrations of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline," which means "skokanska plate."
Aspirant champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them to the height of almost 10 meters and perform formations with several elements (salta, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme they are evaluated according to the design, difficulty and "time in the air."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympics is ahead.
Fighters for a gold medal must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They try to catch up not only with the target tape or the starting wall, but, as TV news reports, with another imaginary line: a world or an Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a little exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on trampoline in this respect brings relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflected, as if they were in a state of weightless as an astronaut, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and of course not even difficulty, but for the duration of the assembly there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only a perfect, graceful suspension of time and gravity.
This is the closest the Olympics and zen will ever come.
The women's qualification and finals take place on Friday afternoon, at 13:00 Eastern time, the male competition then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals within the afternoon block, which begins at 2pm for both days.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably miss through the other fights.
And if attention is only to be achieved by male athletes being the subject of love and materialization - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by US gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered the violent resistance of the government.
Witnesses claim that many protesters were shot during the confrontation with the police.
Is there a war on Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But over the last few months, anti-government riots have taken over the country, spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses claim that police officers shot and killed a bunch of unarmed protesters.
On the passing videos of protests, which are probably coming from the end of last year or early this year, are captured by the security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now asking for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to take a step forward," said Rashid Abdi, Head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the dangers of terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few from African countries, if any, are receiving such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - even a new suburban train runs in Addis Ababa's capital.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization that fights for human rights without stopping talking about government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been banished, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
However, this may change.
"When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breach," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the young.
He's protesting generations.
Complaints are many and concern everything from ground disputes to absolute control of the ruling coalition's power.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies gained the last chair held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, the pressure is increasing on the Eritrean border. The conflict along this imprecisely marked, the disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitists fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why after years of smoldering under the surface, these bitter feelings have rekindled.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government forbids access to Facebook or Twitter, as it usually does during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxy to hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about their gathering for protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhars are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, have excelled in politics and trade and have benefited from Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to a united leadership," said Mulata Gemech, the leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests took place in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrai ethnicity, which account for around 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riot is Meles Zenawa's death.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an undisclosed disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterfully able to detect initial signals of discontent and used envoys to process opponents and to get on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, analyst of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigra region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigrei.
Many fear that further bloodshed will result.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots in 2005 was after thousands of people protested what analysts called the elections that the government failed and then stole.
A hard hit followed, during which many protesters were killed - although less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop this.
And there is dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the city of Gondar, Amsterdam, attacked business companies owned by Tigerjci and resentment against the Tigerjci on social networks has become increasingly common.
The analysts say that protests put US and other Western allies in an awkward situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as "sarcasm"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump attempted to counter the latest controversy that flooded his campaign by saying that he did not mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward position, who struggled to defend him during a turbulent time and must explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
After this proposal for a meeting on Wednesday night Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the interviews that he did not really intend to say that the President and H. Clinton created the IS.
However, in his Twitter post on Friday morning Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The contribution was contrary to the claim of the old man just one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease his remark by reminding him that Obama was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at the moment when Trump attempted to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his preferences in election polls were falling.
Trump and Clinton took part in the Michigan duel this week on economic issues.
On Friday Trump tried to return to this topic.
On Twitter, he warned once again that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and he said that some say her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defenses earlier.
At the end of July, when he gathered a wave of criticism, when he came forward with the suggestion that the Russians should penetrate Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comment by saying, "I am, of course, sarcastic."
This approach enables Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to moderate them as necessary.
"I think it is his way of testing to what extent some reports have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and then, according to the reaction, "he gave an explanation," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that he is skilled in his statements and he knows that they are vague enough to explain them differently.
Because the results of the polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen even more twitchy tone in recent days, instead of reducing things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Tump is very far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump even tries to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstood his sense of humor.
But along with Trump's increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes put his devoted supporters in an unpleasant situation, who must stand up for him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview for CNN on Thursday.
"I believe that what he is saying is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when asked about Trump's credible claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he completely mistakenly called a rookie, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton acted as Secretary of State, allowed the IS to rampant and fail to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter to rain fire on the media for overcoming and biasing his every word.
He laughed at the "poor, pathetic " TV scholars who were trying to understand him and said: "They can't do that! "
Several Democrats have apologized to Trump's apology for smirking that it's just another piece of evidence that he's not qualified for the presidency.
Café was pushed out of the market prices. Now returning in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned as the last loss of a growing city.
On Twitter, artist Molly Crabapple wrote: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is plundered, and the Verb is now a soap shop. "
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay for the transfer to a new location, he said he'd be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even used the old Verb lighting again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new too.
He started using new ingredients.
There are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings, such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find brown rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady tide of original regulars.
"A number of original customers had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices," he said.
Last Sunday there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliver.
Mrs. Oliver (34) lived in Williamsburg, and she went to Verb Cafe often.
Even then, the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I liked was coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day instead of her usual iced coffee she gave a scrambled chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been married to Verb since 2003.
He goes to work and orders the same thing every time.
"At quarter and eight a day, like a watch, I will come and prepare my bagel for me with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal keeps ordering what he usually does, but sometimes he gets bacon, eggs and ham on his bagel with everything.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry about the soap shop taking his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make special soap for Verb and to use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
Traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also accepted the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose it to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice manufacturer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the cafe to spread to the neighboring building.
It's enough for many customers to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopened, coming in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from a time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the presidency in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt's loafer enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as gooseberry pate and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: an egg for the devilish way in a tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans to eat. "
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights have a history of gastronomics.
The last book by Andrew Coe "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal" published by Harper on Tuesday is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed chef solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg sandwich shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball that, according to the couple, was perfect for talking about food during the crisis.
"The meatballs were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
It was sold peanut, liver and bean burgers.
They were made from the ingredient and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe smirked.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet to eat what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner served freshly baked pie.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" observed how the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," said Coe on explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally feared: Mysterious foods have spread, such as meatballs and dishes made of casseroles, casseroles as "a wonderful way to use leftovers," Ziegelman remarked, because cooks could hide unesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
For years, meat - the central point of American food - has become an economical luxury.
Strange mixtures that were intended to serve as caloric and nutritional fillings had priority over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During the surveys for a book containing recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period meal of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: "It was surreal. "
Peanut butter with roasted onions doesn't match.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, the chief of the Federal Office for Home Economy between 1923 and 1943 - controlled the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, calling on women to take the reins of the budget, and slops, such as creamy spaghetti and carrots, turned into delicious dishes.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, desserts were produced in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's posture "I'll have a pie."
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen of his childhood, he dined as the chosen millionaire he became.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost greasy room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would likely have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not forced him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, which led to the White House "not only serving the most expensive food in Washington, but also in the most unhappy way prepared. "
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis subsided as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The link remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way that science is applied to cooking.
A few say that while writing a book, they better understood Miss Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - perhaps why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman reminded me: "The people of her were sick. "
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It is called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly plunged a spoon into dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as a proper caretaker, he said to his wife: "A little meatloaf walnuts would be good. "
Europeans: The migrants are coming for benefits.
Most refugees who roll into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's what TV shows would look like if we filmed them.
A group of Russian artists calling themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
With a photoshop, it creates collages that are funny enough to show what it would look like if famous TV shows and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of legal representation in the case of a patent against type C yolk against Merck Group
The District Court of Justice has held that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal fees incurred by it in its patent against Type C yolk against the pharmaceutical manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was to pay 200 million for the damage caused by the breach of Merck's two patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge repeatedly found illegal acts on the part of Merck, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated in the file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation drugs against C-type yolk, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead medicines.
Americans supported military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
Military units supported by the US gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic State fled the city, said the spokesperson of the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after leaving the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The troops liberated over 2,000 civilians who were detained by the radicals, he told Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbuj military council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we're still searching it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
On Friday Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, stating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had income of $ 10.75 million in the year in question and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Expansion Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million to the joint cash register for lectures, and the former Foreign Secretary admitted a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster for his book on his work at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, American Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, together with her wife Anne Holton, published tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to be a model of financial transparency," she said in Jennifer Palmieri's statement, which helped Clinton with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for candidates for the President of the United States to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York City, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the US Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign aide on Twitter and followed up on the democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Special Trump's advisor, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, among whom is the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profits, contributions to charity, commercial transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has a strong voice on the question, and on Friday she published a video reminding us of how high-ranking the Republican Republicans urge Trump to publish their tax returns.
On Thursday I will mention the question in my speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other presidential candidates have been doing for decades - publish their tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico stated that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and New York Times' publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim that this might be the case at present.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election of the President.
Clinton enforces a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns at the Clinton Assembly in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Buffet conglomerate of Berkshire Hathaway is based.
Buffett said he also went through an IRS audit and that Trump is "not afraid" of the financial office, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign issued tax returns back until 2007.
On average, the Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, between 2007 and 2014 paid a federal tax of 32 percent on average and a combined tax of approximately 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return shows that unlike most Americans, their income accounts for only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or elephant protection fireworks in Tanzania
The conservationists of nature in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder.
This procedure has proved successful and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, how to protect their homes and crops in four steps without harming animals.
Many of them used to use spears to defend themselves.
Friday is the world day of elephants dedicated to protecting these animals.
"Since they have been developed by this... set of tools, we have noticed a change in behaviour in these communities. People believe that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them," said the CEO of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in a statement.
The first and second steps are on the passing elephant to light the flashlight and lower the horn.
If it doesn't discourage him, he'll be thrown out of the so-called "chilli cloud."
Chili powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with a firecracker in a condom, its end is sealed so that only a wick can look from it.
After the detonation, the condom explodes, and a fine chilli powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually one whiff is enough, and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate a fireworks device that triggers a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned into the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel to the "application" of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a disturbance in the media after he discovered that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee's words on the basis of the "demand" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary film about the Holocaust "Shoah," ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the code list for calling the hotel.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 it was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers instead the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation, and he turned to the hotel reception with a problem.
According to Lanzmann, the answer he received was "shocked. "
The hotel worker replied that the measure was "decided at the discretion of Kempinski Hotels' management.
The reason for this step was even more irritating to the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's call code be deleted," said Lanzmann's employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, ambassador of Israel in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case "a great shame."
We were appalled and shocked by events.
In itself, it's a huge embarrassment.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong online response, people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply "lost" in the requirements of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," says another post, which points out that the hotel, located on the noble street Kurfurstendamm, is located near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel daily, the hotel itself quickly dropped any charges by calling the event a "observation" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
"Never issued a direct order" does not include Israel in the call code list, citing Suddeutsche Zeitung as a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
There was a conflict between students and police in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disperse the students, which ended with police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin in order to save money is the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spraying signs against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the protesters went into the streets to support the deposed President Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate in the country decided to prosecute her.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan's trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year on year after the abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the Ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies restore existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia's exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The leap increase in trade ensured the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas to Iran's citizens, mostly travelers.
Moreover, Iran first reached the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians, and the Ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scottish Callum Skinner rushes home after the British have won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a male team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio when the VB team trio defended the title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake that he took for his Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man delighted the legend when he came to the finish and stole the victory from the hands of the favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth at the world championship in the field cycling in March, even though Hoy had completed his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for Jamie Staff's special opening racer.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
After Hoy's departure, there was also a vacancy that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man of British coaches, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was together with Hoy's champion four years ago - and with Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but the jersey took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was a little behind on his bike, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation when Hindes went on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy tracked the race from his position as BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes got off stage, he kept an eye on them.
23 - year - old Skinner, a Glasgow native, said: "It's a flattering comparison. "
I'm here to get the best of myself and to honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals, and we beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win this thing.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the note, and Britain's rivals had no possibility of appeal.
This time around this victory there was no such problem.
Hindes said: "With all the British flags on the bleachers, I felt like London. "
In the last three months, we've all joined together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we have five successful days for the Velodrome.
With the form Kenny presented, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
It would then be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has his birthday on 23rd March (this date seems sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates birthdays Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Same amount Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny's gonna be part of a sprint that starts today and lasts another three days.
An 18 - year - old native from Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this one now.
Team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knight's title. "
That was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest team fighter race for four kilometers.
They're done with 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the finals (22:42) take place on today's second day of the race, which will certainly focus on Wiggins.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioners when the judges called on him to measure the height.
In a similar race of women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of track cycling and took over the middle period of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, proving absolute superiority in Beijing and London, the expectations of Rio have decreased during the preparations for Rio.
On the background were dramatic events, last but not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as demonstrated by the first night of the Velodrome races, the legendary reputation that the UK team can perform with perfect timing seems to confirm itself again.
Uncertain future of the meltery in Portland after the end of the power supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium melting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that the company supplies electricity and which informed one of the owners of the plant's intention to terminate the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
This is taking place after the government of the State of Victoria has previously decided not to extend the grant that keeps the company going.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk in Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be put at risk when closed.
And since the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of total electricity produced in Victoria, other avalanche effects may occur.
Alcoa shut down Point Henry in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesa power plant last year.
The Alcoa plant in Portland is a loser and is in danger of being shut down.
This is followed by several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said that it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the small shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
"The AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to function, in other words, that there will be a significant demand for electricity from the plant," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "guarantee contracts' which were to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017', declared the power plant.
Any possible impact on AGL's profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to a strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written down the value of contracts under its accounting books of $ 187 million "in case of termination. "
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract "does not affect its ... ability to operate a melting plant or to secure the supply of electricity to a melting plant."
The American company stated that in 2010, it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to start to apply from November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very careful when it comes to the possible closure of the Portland meltery in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
The manager of the AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen operation, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real estate TV show - now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the cover of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, an ambassador of Estee Lauder, who performed at a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page makes me want to cry," Kendall wrote.
The front page was unveiled by a bizarre (or simply continued humor in Kardashians?) video staged in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (the bar troublemakers Rob and Caitly and along with all the favorite uncles from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).
It's the stage line of almost every "birthday" episode of the children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit on the show at 8:00 a.m.), but somehow Kris needed to make sure the other girls could feed on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we must have entered the new era of Kardashians.
Older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the most sold issue of the whole year.
The issue, which resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that from 832 pages last year's edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star that appears on the front page is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the images of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities that make models" than "models that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar and Dior Ambassador, appeared on the headline in 2013, and a year later, Laga Gaga had the honour.
But even if it is very unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as a "breaking model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, he will be in a very good company.
These celebrities aren't related to famous people, or the stars of real estate shows, or kids today who know how to make a well-cut video (even if Jenner represents all of this).
They are provenly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "sluts of the moment."
These feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is not appropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's showing off for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare moments, he's doing a reality show, maybe just one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
The Community's Legal Aid Centers annually reject 160,000 people
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community centres of legal aid and are preparing for impacts in the sector itself, which will have further restrictions on funds for already overly busy services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, workers at risk, victims of violence, and people with no money to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already rejected when they seek free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to burst, are going to further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal finance.
The Director of Community Legal Assistance Centres in Queenslad James Farrell said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Assistance Centres, 5,000 people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that the situation would deteriorate without abolishing the federal government's decision.
"The Community's legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped relations with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands more vulnerable people from Queensland having to focus on complex legal problems without help.
We call on the State's Attorney and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, to prevent this reduction of funds immediately, so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the state has honoured its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of community centres of legal aid and the community of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign suit after a staff member reportedly pointed a gun.
New York: The Donald Trump campaign was sued for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February aimed the gun at a crew member while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file that Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software instructor in the state, handed over to Charlotte State Court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that "this will not happen. "
Director Earl Phillip "signed his fingers with a gun, put the right index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel to Vincent's kneecap," said Bordini in the lawsuit.
It says in the file that Bordini, following a complaint with local and regional campaign management, found that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
"Guns don't have to shoot to cause damage" said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The prosecution comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate has provoked a riot when he told the voters in North Carolina that they could intervene by the owners and arms holders (which is modified in the US in the second amendment to the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and is able to appoint her judge.
Trump's campaign says the media ripped his words out of context and that Trump didn't defend violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit requests compensation from the campaign for careless supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokesperson Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the commentary report.
The attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded within a short period of time to his Innovative Consulting Services consulting company.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
To me, Heathrow is extremely attractive, just as was London 2012, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we're gonna do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities will we create 10,000 new teaching posts, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
Just as before the London Olympics in 2012, there are some who will think the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of £ 211 billion, a legacy of skills and jobs both in the vicinity of the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which, in time and budget, introduced an infrastructure investment programme worth £11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years in a row, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver the third runway worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
Games in London in 2012 were a huge success for Great Britain and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure future trade and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Director of Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat and mouse game in blocking ads
At least that's what one of the companies that program such software says.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users can update the filters in their program and reblock advertising on this social network.
Facebook on Tuesday stated that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been bypassed.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that "this kind of war between the open source community blocking ads and those who are trying to bypass them has lasted since the advertising blockage was invented" and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-correction.
The fact that a society that owns the world's largest social network has joined the war only proves how much of a problem blocking advertising for industry has become.
According to a study, pagefair performed a tker last year, and Adobe uses advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times as many as it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of the profits of Facebook advertising, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker said that the company, however, goes against advertising filters on desktops because mobile ad filters for mobile applications for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on desktops still represents a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it will update the ad setting tool (ad preferences) to give people the opportunity to better control how ads are displayed to them.
On Thursday Facebook said that the new Adblock filters worry them because they could also block content that is not related to advertising.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," said Facebook spokesperson in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, which is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences, which give control to people.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an event that on Thursday morning several cars were run over by a woman who was likely trying to commit suicide.
There was an accident on highway A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight in four.
In a statement, the police in Vaud stated that the actress of the "despairy act" was lying in the dark on the road and she was run over by several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, not all have yet been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who have witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said to Le Tribune de Geneve attorney Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent impact?
This is what the prosecutor must find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, drivers do not seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was dismissed from the charge of reckless killing after she struck down and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
It was said in court that the victim at the age of 22 drank alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the distress call - had gone in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation, " said the judge.
Anyone with information on Thursday's incident with Morges should report to the police on phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague within Prague Pride.
On Friday, the executive director of the AČČČKA told Kateřina Petříčková.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders closer to life.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Petričková said.
According to a survey by organizers, foreign visitors spend CZK 3100 per person on average daily.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications etc.
"To tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in staying in higher prices with high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petričková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held this year as part of the festival programme.
It is lectured by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday 14th August.
The main theme of this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
This year, the parade that thousands of people have attended honors the silence of the victims of the June attack at the nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat have been celebrating forty years.
Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained both small and large viewers for 40 years.
The pilot of this evening's series, director Lubomír Beneš, was premiered on August 12, 1976.
After the creation of this animated series, which is now known by viewers in more than a hundred countries around the world, there were cartoon by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who invented for a magazine with two handymen Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited Dramaturg Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimir Jiránek to cooperate and together created the film Kuťáci.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red trick and a couch and radio was given to characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak television began to take place in the Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the Kutili in 1985, this time it was directed directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, further works continued with other creators, many of whom were attended by Beneš's son Mark.
There are now over 90 episodes with the stories of these handicrafts, which all fall under their hands, but they never get mad at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and finally they are satisfied with their work, which will prove a well-known gesture " ... and that's it!"
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, to DVDs and theaters and characters or other toys with Pat and Mata pictures are a hit of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and a two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sport and one life.
They both have a good ending.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend, and she's happy with her.
And for what things do people spend the most at airports?
It's a Friday review of the world's websites.
The first Olympic medal.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Rugby's selection of this archipelago beat in the Olympic tournament finals of the seven-inch rugby team of Great Britain.
It is the first medal ever received by Fiji at the Olympics.
Waiting for the first precious metal to gain took 60 years since sending the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
The coach of Fiji is taking great credit for success.
Ironically, however, it is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals as a British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the finals.
Fiji finally dominated it in a sovereign way, and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report was delivered by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without her arms and legs since 11 months of age, got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," rejoiced the two-year-old girl, as her mother revealed to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her hands and legs and then sit together without a prosthetic.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year, and doctors only gave her a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He's got perspective.
I saw her introduce herself to other kids with the words "Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands," said my mother.
Look at the joy the doll has brought.
What are we spending most on at the airport?
CNN brings a finding that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel essential stores chain has published data for the last year, where it summarizes 10 products that customers buy most often in their airport stores.
The water was super first.
Drinks were generally very popular, in the top ten eight were placed.
The ninth place was occupied by a large pack of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who closes the top ten?
You can't eat as one of the above things.
CNN says it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The oars' sovereigns.
We're just going to win, laughing at Murray and Bond.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have ruled the category of two without a helmsman for seven years and confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, a disparate couple has switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
In Thursday's finale, Rodrigo de Freitas scored a 69th win in a row.
What are we different from the others?
We are just prettier, joking Murray already during the Olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different from the others.
We just train hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two metres tall and a stolile chasnik, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilometers lighter.
Moreover, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has had, for example, a charity boxing match.
They don't spend much time together outside of rowing, either.
Eric is basically boarding the ship with the fact that we can't lose.
Let's just go win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, Bond admitted, who even at the press conference demonstrated that Murray was the dominant in the crew.
He was the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, he destroys his opponents with a calm force.
They're moving at their pace, and although often halfway through the track they're not in the lead, they haven't yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile.
We're just trying to drive a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, Murray said forty-four years old.
With his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Cup.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without the helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move to the 2nd without the helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they seem to have atone for the greatest defeat of their careers and confirmed dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything Coach told us, and we didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was gonna be pretty damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, said Murray.
We know they're all trying to throw us off the throne.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
Climate Model by NASA: Venus was once habitable
According to projections of the new climate model NASA, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at Goddard's NASA Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate study scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and saturated CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could exist.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of turning Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once boasted a thin atmosphere similar to Earth, while turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to control life and provide protection against rapid vaporization.
Venus used to use the sun, which was 30 percent more subdued.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during slow rotation, the day side to the sun is almost two months at a time," explained the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats up the surface and creates rain that creates a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and shield the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus, similar to the evolution previously hypothetically constructed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over a few billion years -- she was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated and water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped and left only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as Coach of the Colorado Avalanche Team
Patrick Roy resigned from his post as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche team on Thursday, stating the impossibility of participating in the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice president/general manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is essential that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his benefits to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in Central Division. But Colorado was dealing with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and over the past two years he hasn't always had a game after the season.
Team Avalanche in season 2015/2016 achieved a score of 39:39:4 and lacked five points to get a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goaltender Roy, who enlisted in the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the oil rig in the North Sea are renewing talks and interrupting the strike
The leaders of the parties said that wage strikes for oil rig workers in the North Sea were interrupted while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The strike against the company of services for the Wood Group oil fields sporadically took place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the United and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current disagreements," the statement states.
Starting next week, we will have a number of day-long meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group reduced rates this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would allow companies to cope with a market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell deleted thousands of people from his payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernise its processes - immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision by Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a Member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders to discuss one of the greatest working disagreements of the entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said.
For comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rate of star rotation in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speed of turning stars from the Pleiada cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how the turning time is related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher in the centre of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiada Observatory is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching a state of adulthood and have been formed for over 125 million years.
Now it's turning the fastest.
At the moments of maximum rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect.
Along with the age of the star, the speed of the star's rotation slows.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between discovering recognizable points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on turning speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" Pleiad we see that the slower-spinning stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
As the Pleiad cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and turning speed.
"The pleiades provide us with anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, with younger and older stars," Rebullová said.
There's still a lot we want to know about how, when and why the stars slow down their turning speed and so on they say "hang up their dancing shoes on a nail."
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the rate of rotation of Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I hadn't volunteered, then wouldn't a qualifying agreement have been concluded, and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without signing up for specialization education after graduating?
My point is that in a field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a slightly farther hospital, but in about six months' time, there could be a vacancy in another where I would like to work.
So I can't figure out how to deal with the situation for about that six months, the question continues.
Matches Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to enter into a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
The qualification agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the return on the costs incurred by increasing or deepening the qualifications of an employee.
In the field of health, there is a long-term pressure to avoid concluding these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the pursuit of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, the participation in specialization education is considered to be an increase in qualifications (not as an increase).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs are at least CZK 75 000.
No legislation nor provides for an obligation to apply for specialisation training.
The Act only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialisation education.
However, the doctor is legally entitled to perform the doctor's profession already due to the completion of the necessary higher education, although under the legal conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized qualifications in the relevant field).
The law foresaw a situation in which professional experience completed in another field of specialisation may be included in the doctor's specialization education, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
In theory, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questioner's situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know more closely the circumstances of this case, a consultation with the relevant Department of the Ministry of Health (Section of Science and Medical Occupations) can be recommended as the Ministry of Health provides legal advisory and consulting services related to the inclusion in specialization education and its course.
Consultancy services are also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which each doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab are asking for US intervention.
The United States made no effort to end the siege (insurgent parts of the city by government troops), and did not use its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, quoted from a letter addressed to the White House by AFP.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over East Halabe to stop the attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halabe is not surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces supporting the army loyal to President Bashar Assad have announced that they will stop every day for three hours of blows in the Halabu area to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELČ are to be stopped all military activities, air attacks and artillery fire.
The UN Humanitarian Operation Chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, but he stressed the need for at least a two-day truce.
According to AFP, 15 out of 35 doctors working in the eastern part of Halabu have already turned to Obama.
