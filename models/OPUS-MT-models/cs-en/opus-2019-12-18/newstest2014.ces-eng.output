The black box in your car?
While American road planners are working hard to find money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box that can easily fit into your car's dashboard.
The facilities that follow every mile that motorists drive away and transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of the controversial efforts of Washington and the State Planning Offices to renovate the outdated system of financing US major roads.
Usually, the drab design of motorways suddenly stimulated intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied to allow the government to use these little lockers to record mileage and perhaps even where you were going - and then use this information to build a tax bill.
Tea party's terrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to the system in which the driver pays for the kilometer of the road he is on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter where we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Civil Service Association, which plans to start monitoring the mileage of every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology serves this purpose.
The incentive is that the Road Trust Fund financed by the taxes that Americans pay at gas stations is down.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars go a lot more miles to one gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system for a mileage.
"This seems to be the most logical alternative in the long run," he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometres travelled.
It is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change patterns of behaviour of drivers, which, for example, can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas formation.
California designers look to this system in planning strategies to meet the targets set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, Chairman of the Transport Committee, said that he also saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market leaders from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for mileage.
"It is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Reason Strategy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who urged Congress in 2011 to move towards a kilometer payment.
Last year, the US Senate approved a pilot project worth USD 90 million, which would include about 10,000 cars.
However, the management of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the members of the population, whose daily life often means taking many kilometres for work outside the city.
Nevertheless, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
Oregon is the hottest, who included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state taxes for mileage, instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently exploring the project.
Illinois tries to do so to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not only have a supporter.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
"Both of Big Brother and such issues were a big problem," said Alaudin Khan, who leads the management of strategy and operation at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Union of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into fully-fledged tracking devices. "
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to register daily trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are trying to find available technology that would enable the state to track how many kilometres the car will drive, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hunting for such technology brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance).
Originally, this company was not involved in aiding the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging insurance market of legal liability, where drivers would pay based on how much they would drive.
But this device that tests attracts the attention of road network designers because it doesn't use GPS and only supplies limited amounts of information that are regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you don't follow their speed and their location," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
They're much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of kilometres travelled by all citizens of the state.
In other places, they hope that the prudent public will approach this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay parking hours, to provide insurance based on mileage and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to participate in this because of the value of benefits offered to them," says the project paper of the city.
Some road designers, however, would like to know whether all the discussions about paying a kilometer are just a huge problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in San Francisco Bay say that Congress could solve the problem of a bankrupt Road Trust Fund very simply by increasing the tax on petrol.
One-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical operations when it is enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka negotiates for ČSSD.
Social democracy is crumbling, the folks and the grandmothers are talking and preparing a common approach.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly aligned partners who will put a complete list of demands on the table, including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD ambassadors then either swallow acid coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days of carrying on a wave of sympathy, first came across.
Yesterday he failed to control the political grémium and mainly force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only him, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the grémia members and now to the citizens.
Lying isn't meant to be, in personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after the negotiations of the narrowest leadership of social democracy.
He added that he did not stick to the position of First Vice-President.
"I will inform my decision on 10 November at the ÚVV," Hašek said.
The Vice-President of the ČSSD Zdeněk Škromach and the head of Jeronem Tejc, spoke similarly.
However, he pointed out that he was elected only two days ago.
Both Members then stated that they would do everything they could to make the 50-member club of the ČSSD sound in one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theatre in the sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities."
So another lie on the air.
Or maybe in calling for Sobotka's resignation and his expulsion from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August ÚVV had 57 percent of the vote that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the party's Prime Minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, made a powerful army of enemies by calling the ÚVV until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body and the media with a bunch of rumours and rumors, eventually recalling Sobotka's real political career mistakes.
There will be a lot of dirty laundry, signs of dark alliances between the Uhlobaron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
The friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
The disputes in South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organizations of ČSSD will bubble.
The warning is the words of Ostrava's mayor and Sobotka's ally Petr Kajnar: "I signed Chartu 77 so that idiots do not rule the country. "
If the ÚVV met this weekend, liars would probably be forced to ritualize their functions.
Traitors will sprinkle their heads in ashes and stay.
And now the winning head of the ČSSD will end with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is demanding
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he exhales deeply: "It is challenging. "
Collaboration with the organizational team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complicated according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of providing information on essential things.
Maybe we've been prying out of them for three months to give us an official label on each village so we can do a whole bunch of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they keep saying they're communicating.
They're still communicating in a lot of things.
Is the Olympian village at least finished?
But it's not a catastrophic state anymore.
We walked around empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do the floors need to be finished?
Just basic concrete, that's what it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th as a vanguard, it'll still smell glue.
And if they don't make it, then what?
President Putin would have driven an army there, wouldn't he?
That's what's gonna happen.
Just so it wasn't that Olympic village = Potemkin's village.
Rather, they may not be able to make the trip, for example, finish the details.
Maybe they'll have to travel in such a state that we'll have to bring our London games boots with us.
But I believe they'll sort it out somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there's about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, that number is changing.
Maybe the figure skaters will probably go in that three-way trip.
No one has to doubt about speed skater Martina Sábliková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Do you still have a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I shouldn't be there until January 26th.
What the houses in the Olympic village will look like, we know.
We even measured some things on the subway so that we wouldn't just trust sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the mission chief do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I'm preparing for an annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm doing a common agenda in terms of communication with the organizational committee in Sochi.
Putin promised him an ecological Olympics, a plan to have a giant secret dump.
Winter sports fans are already cutting a meter into the opening of the Sochi Olympic Games, others are looking at their preparation with ever greater fears.
The Russian Olympics, although not until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to fail to fulfill the promise that the preparation and holding of games will not disturb the nature of the Krasnodar Region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After all, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a high-level standard, and Canadian games became the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to organizing "zero-waste" games was long overdue.
AP reporters discovered a huge landfill of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi last week.
So a dump full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foam was found by environmentalists in August, which was reported immediately.
The Russian authorities have disappeared from the pits and dumps.
But only for a little while.
Last week, reporters had a view of a dump the size of three football fields.
Not the only one in the area of such places arose several, described by the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, are working on the site, building about 60 kilometers between Sochi Airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railroads defended the fact that the landfill was founded by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months and nights.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"Water from here contaminates the sočské water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," he told the British newspaper Vladimir Kimajev from the environmental non-profit organization EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
To compare: Sochi's games will cost $51 billion, while the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics cost $43 billion.
Last year's London games cost only 19 billion and the Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and fears, if there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected during work at the sports and infrastructure exhibition.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth to protest that he hadn't been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are struggling during games with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple mature to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was assigned to design a house on a plot situated on the corner of two streets, while the land itself is somewhat sloped.
In addition, it said that there would be two generations in the house who would like to live together, but each one should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple needed an extra small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"In making the proposal, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the site."
"Three different functions of the house are connected through several paths through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
Parents' home is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories bind.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in the final layout of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed using boards panels, the part where the office is plastered white and the remaining elements remained in clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected to the exterior.
The home of parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior to the exterior highlights the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to fall through them.
This is what architects were trying to distinguish the house from others and instill something unique in them.
The home of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black colour.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the front door, finds themselves in the lobby and then rises up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, it applies to both Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on open letters from students, educators and seniors in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of Honorary President SPOZ - Zemanovci during the election period, even received a rematch in the form of a non-invitation to celebrate the national festival of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who were no longer so brave and visited Miloš Zeman made it possible: University of Technology in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
The newly elected ODS Member, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post, and it also seems normal to him.
Professor, that's not really the same as staying in the mayor's smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the officers of the CSSD who at the same time serve as a Member and a Governor and as well as degrade both occupations?
You're telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions with your left back.
I know we have an example of Michal Hašek, who can even handle several dozen functions at once.
That's probably not the kind of person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post so that she could devote herself fully to the management of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's office is that you will violate the politicality of the University of Pardubice's academic land in the course of your duties.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current presence in both posts as an advantage for the University.
But you will be able to help "your" school without being dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion to mine and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may find that the voters will count it for you in the next election.
And that doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovice bubble cabbage, chemistry doesn't add to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut want to produce in the coming months in the Slovácké Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
A healthy delicacy has been produced here since 1925 in a traditional way, i.e. by pedaling directly in large tanks.
It's a rarity in modern industrial times.
Our worker's on a shift of nearly ten kilometers.
15 to 30 tons of cabbage will fit into each of the ten tanks, one takes three shifts to fill," said the director of the race Slovácká Fruta David Kladroba.
Sauerkraut reports take farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko directly from their fields to the company's premises.
The Fruta staff then clean the vegetables, remove the brooms and throw them in the ring.
From there already chopped cabbage falls into swimming pools at a depth of six meters, where pedals untiringly work in white clothing and boots.
That's what crowds out the unwanted air.
The last clogged layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and loaded with water.
"The green horn is then ripened for six to eight weeks under spontaneous milk fermentation without any additions to fermentation," emphasized director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production under home conditions, the individual layers of workers spill through salt and cumin.
Cabbage after fermentation travels to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet-sour solution into bags or jars and is subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly on the domestic and Slovak market.
Interest in it is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "co-operate" with Germany in connection with US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence snitch, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, who passed on to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as defectors and tries to criminalize political speeches by heavy actions that do not give room for defence. "
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that support for the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, said for Zeit Online magazine: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make this possible. "
The tension in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when the claim was made that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament who runs a parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US," it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a Member of Parliament for the German Green Party, published on his Twitter post a photo with Mr Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that Mr. Snowden would not have been able to return to Russia if he had gone away one day.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, said a Member of Parliament.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his "act of political expression " gave him courage.
Citizens throughout the country and senior officials - including those in the United States - have evaluated the unwarranted system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved. "
We're sorry for the killing, but we're innocent.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Red Hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is former head of state.
During the reign of Khmer Rouge, which relied on a mixture of maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of that population.
This commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interests of the nation and had no idea what the real scale of killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should have understood everything and thus intervened and corrected the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he never ordered the Khmer Reds to " treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or to commit genocide. "
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under Khmer Red regime, told AFP that she could not accept Nuon Che's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"He doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she said, adding that the Khmer leaders are "worse than the monsters."
He was also to stand before the court as the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" of the Khmer Red regime of Ieng Sara, who died this March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012, the court found an incompetent trial for dementia.
The leader of Khmer Red Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 on its flights for the deposit of hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to impose a fee of up to USD 100 per hand luggage and USD 2 per coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage fee concerns luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers are waiting to arrive at the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's spokesman said that the $100 fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
Airlines started charging their first and second luggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed into hand luggage hidden in storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really is not to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier's gate can bring luggage for which nothing will pay, while the other passenger in front pays USD 100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the websites and clearance procedures will be modified to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before arriving at the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will not be in force until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and passengers who require it should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of loss.
Most of them didn't touch the hand luggage charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost Allegian Air later followed its example.
The only company with such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says Air Transport Advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the deposit fee of Spirit would be USD 50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when the passengers encountered the unusual charge of Spirit's hand luggage.
"Onboarding the plane was the most fluid thing I've ever seen in my flight career," he said.
I thought I'd see teeth and arguments at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the arrival took place in a flash."
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, along with Spirit.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be added free of charge.
The water will continue to be administered free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly attempted to introduce drinks fees, but after the passenger complaints from seven months later it withdrew and no other major airline imitated it.
The last move of Frontier to charge hand luggage if passengers do not buy a flight directly from this airline is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay Internet travel agents such as Orbitz from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so via Internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the farthest in this area.
In September, she began to give customers who purchased via an Internet travel agency only half a mile under the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut off the reward for flying miles at 25 percent of the mile from the trip.
So the journey with Frontier is 1,000 miles long purchased via an Internet travel agency, which means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly via Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver's hometown, but its business is starting to shrink and losing money.
According to the financial results presented on Wednesday by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
The Republic is also trying to solve Frontier's financial problems by selling this airline.
The NSA's website isn't blaming hackers, it's blaming "inside error."
The secret National Security Agency said last Friday that her website fell for a few hours last week due to an internal error, not a hacker attack, as some said on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov pages were not accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," said the spy agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be eliminated during tonight.
The claim that the blackout was caused by the DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Previously, online server sensors recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
Previously, NSA spokesperson for ABC News reported that the agency's internal sensitive networks were not "at all" threatened.
The speaker said that no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for shutting down NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target websites with information until the servers overload and the site crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super secret agency, once known as No such agency, has become the center of public attention after a series of foreign and domestic surveillance programs in recent months, and the target of biting criticism is the product of stealing NSA classified files from the agency and exposing them to disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profits fell due to a decrease in supply and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced a 15% decrease in net profit due to a smaller number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any data on the flight test for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with the ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane only flew three times and the question arose as to whether the test phase progressed well.
The results did not meet the estimates and the stock exchange in Toronto fell by 8 percent.
On Thursday, the analyst of Cameron Doerksen, a state bank analyst, reduced the rating from "higher profitability" to "sector performance" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While smaller aircraft deliveries were expected mostly, the profit margin in the transport sector disappointed us significantly," Doerksen said in his report to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe that Bombardier will acquire new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market skepticism against this programme will increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will fight into the bottom of the market, which now dominate Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March and after several months of delay the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft is modest 177 because potential buyers are waiting for test flight results to verify the company's low consumption and savings claims on the costs of this transport aircraft.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and liabilities from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director of Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The senior staff also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was proceeding as planned.
"The test plane did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in the conference call and noted that the ground examinations and software updates were scheduled during the departure of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan for putting the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the following months.
"This slow pace of flight tests - although it is in line with Bombardier's internal plan - will probably strengthen our view that putting into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,' said Doerksen.
From USD 172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier's net profit fell to USD 147 million in the third quarter ending September 30, or 8 cents per share.
Adjusted returns per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover decreased marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to IBES, Thomson Reuters' analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that, compared to 57 aircraft, it had only supplied 45 aircraft a year earlier during the quarter.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32,9 billion as at 30 September, which does not change even as at 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlooks, but low order intake and the overall market situation failed us," said Beaudoin.
The revenue in the aviation industry dropped 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that the yield in this division rose by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32,6 billion as of 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The executives indicated that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced the arrival of Google's financial director Patrick Pichette, fell by 8.5 percent during the business on Thursday afternoon to USD 4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
A cocaine addict lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in jail.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to convey information to King Neil Scarbrough of the underworld.
The attorney was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who briefed a drug mafia man about a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had sensitive information about the investigation into his drug trafficking activities after becoming suspected of cocaine use.
A lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated by criminals as the best attorney was arrested at his home in 2011 following police surveillance by Scarborough, who was represented in previous drug proceedings.
Police spotted Sarborough (32), as he left three bags of cocaine in a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, which was just at dinner with his colleagues at the Lawyer's Society.
Based on the tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to seek information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were under surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After arresting heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million, along with GBP 200,000 in cash during a series of raids, a further 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) passed information on to criminals for fear of his addiction to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors law firm based in Blackburn, experienced shameful moments in front of the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstruction of justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
He confessed to cocaine possession during an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after Scarborough's police investigation revealed that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and spotted him placing drugs of a purity of 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium at Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer came home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
It was said in court that there were traces of Class A drugs found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, and said that he spoke to a suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation was part of "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditt took his wallet and tried to take some credit cards out of it, but they were all detained and hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated the office at both his home address and his workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work.
However, the Court heard that after key arrests, he contacted important drug supply players, some of whom had previously represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is more aware that she must not violate the law than an attorney in criminal matters. "
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as attorney and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here isn't just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation thwarted as much as it could to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta has not given his profession a good reputation, but he has dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditto rejected the offense and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I would like to give Mr. Scarborough information, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do so immediately. "
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta became an attorney in the criminal area himself a criminal when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals. "
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of the organized crime groups, who gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and encourage the public to trust and feel they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditt betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the mantle of his profession.
The Lancashire Major and Organized Crimes Unit has conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and put you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Another 35 persons involved in trafficking were imprisoned for 153 years in total for drug offences.
On his website, Ditt conducted an online interview in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death cell block in America, as a guest at dinner would like Mohammed Ali and as an incentive for the job he introduced inequality.
He was negotiating with Klaus and Spidey about the government.
Now the people of Jan Kasal were sent against Babiš.
The People's Party has won fourteen Members in elections, i.e. only one third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
However, they enter into negotiations on government with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to conjecture the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who tuned the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrei Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time, it will probably remind us of the first negotiations in 1992 when the ODS was also a brand new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasala estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press is outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a frightening report and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is extended by the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to Star, the bill effectively gives "complete control of the media " to the government, and Standard reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "have taken a hard blow, " criticizing the bill as" strict. "
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack of the Islamic shooter in the Westgate shopping centre.
The wrath of the authorities was turned on by Kenyan media when they broadcast surveillance footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a leading media officer called in for questioning, but the subpoena was later withdrawn after media pressure.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of "removal out of the list" or may be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The General Court shall also have the right to seize the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "there is one fine enough to destroy most radio stations. "
It is also said that these measures may have an impact on what is called the Kenyan "living blogosphere."
Politicians know that if they shut up the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what can happen," wrote a journalist named Nation Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenyan media as a key source of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back into hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts imposed by the national payroll agency and to renew their fat salaries of around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, which thus ranks among the highest in the world.
They must be saved, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea what interest
More and more Czechs put their money aside.
Still, they do not reach the champions of saving in the region.
The Austrians, who save on average EUR 181 a month, save most of their money.
A little more than the Czechs will save people in Slovakia.
This results from the survey of Erste Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that savers' mood is improving, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to set aside more money.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranks of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little savings products.
For example, almost every other Serb, according to the survey, saves at home "under the pillow. "
In the country this year, the number of people who save higher amounts per month has risen.
Last month, 26 percent of respondents put aside thousands of to 2.5 thousand crowns for various kinds of savings, five percent more this year.
The average monthly bookmark in year-on-year comparison fell slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit between saving products is pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is falling, and interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to last year.
Only 16 percent of respondents use these, while last year it was almost a quarter of the population.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they make on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how much their money is worth.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their deposited money, with 73 percent among those over 50 years of age.
In the international comparison of Erste Czechs, 44 percent of people regularly use online banking.
They are followed by the Slovaks and Austrians with a 12 percent distance.
The UN celebrates the new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations starts working without delay on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago in order to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ki-mun, said overnight at the summit that now is the time to "ascend above national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development - SDG," he said.
The SDG will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the Development Programme after 2015.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given by the Member States and implement our vision of the sustainable development objectives that build on the success of the MDG.
Concerns about Mozambique's security are escalating due to a conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founder's brass president, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to proclaim a rare public demonstration of peace passwords.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she traded her business clothes for a T-shirt decorated with "we demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there have been reports almost daily of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the White Government in Rhodesia, and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict will break out again in the country, but recent events have frightened foreign investors and locals.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake, as discoveries of large-scale offshore reserves of oil and coal in the northwest can bring more than $50 billion worth of investment from companies such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and the American Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo has been blaming each other for the tensions that have arisen.
Renamo claims that the government sparked the last conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala on 17 September, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault of former rebels subsequently culminated when the government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times the spokesperson of the Renamo Fernando Mazanga party.
The government is accusing Renamo of starting conflicts because they say he was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to ease his fear of instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office of AFP on Wednesday said that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as "the loser" who wanted to use "anything left of his power to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns rose when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo Party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
France Télécom said that he meant that Frelimo's party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate the tension between these parties, fueled by a series of fights this year.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the tutor at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought election changes, has already stated that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the dying movement to gain advantages and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo Party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza - whose second term ends next year - wants to destroy this country's democracy.
"He does not want a democratic system of more parties, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to release the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what possibilities the Renamo party has, but has carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on a key road between North and South.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres away from the capital city of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on their exports of coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of abductions.
"People think that the responsibility for the country's future lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for the way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that "the rough force cannot be equal to clever cunning " while the arthur legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
A large part of myths would "be too wild for teaching at school, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene" said Crossley-Holland, who intercedes for careful selection of works corresponding to age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk work are already part of the education," he said.
I've defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly instructing " authors and teachers are in a captivating story with a" subliminal " message for children as a" switch. "
Crossley-Holland, who has translated epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and British national myths, says: "You can have good intentions, but you do better to keep them to yourself. "
Probably the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is a need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended with a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly defined.
The old truth is it's better to show than to describe.
Brno observatory will take visitors to space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sink into new comfortable seats and a projection area with a diameter of 17 metres in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz has been added above their heads.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, more smaller projectors are spread around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is twenty-one computers that generate images," said the director of the Brno observatory Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a comprehensive impression.
"The output of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than that of conventional personal computers," said the technician from the observatory Tomáš Hladík.
Digitarium can conjure an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or ocean floor.
The audience will find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a man.
Another similar device is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project purchased programs and its own production in the hall.
There's been two shows on the agenda since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People learn about the training of cosmonauts, they go out into space, they spin on centrifuges, and then they see the challenges of space astronauts.
The second show is for children and has the name Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a reef whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment a nearby volcano exploded.
The entire digitarium cost about CZK 50 million, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed smaller amounts from its budget.
Projection area cost CZK 10 million, projector 12 million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual technology and computers," explained Dušek.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the observatory went through two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, 25 to 30,000 visitors could still be here by the end of the year.
We've studied 11,000 INZERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 advertisements offering a job, 4300 of which were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet thus becomes the most important medium for publishing job offers.
Back in 2005, when the survey took place for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it has settled to around 60 percent.
According to the analysis, advertising of labour opportunities reflects the current labour market situation to a large extent.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and during the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, nearly 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reference period, less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, the author of the analysis said Pavlína Šťastnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies for both media.
Advertisements looking for managers and executives, business representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the lead on the Internet.
The position of programmers or small business leaders was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation is mainly for service and labour professions.
Of course, the most frequently stated requirements expressed by employers through advertising are education.
Other areas of interest included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was given in three percent of the advertisements on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of the advertisements, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in daily newspapers in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
The practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally associated with qualified professions.
It is mainly the production manager and other executives.
For workers' professions it is mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical equipment, the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employers also state in the middle of their adverts the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential applicants.
As the most often required skills, communication skills are already appearing in the first place of advertising.
Furthermore, employers require flexibility, adaptation and dynamics, autonomy, accountability, organisational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that the city of New York is where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variet artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chair of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the people gathered by the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines solo comedy, celebrates her tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and big theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and have become successful to the point that they are too big to play in the club," said Hirschová.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes a performance by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up For Heroes," an annual musical comedy performance at Madison Square Garden, where among others Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
Just as this festival has spread, the world of comedy has spread.
Several comics participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll is up with his sitcom and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and Recreation," but she was most famous for her fast-paced series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on."
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a nasty, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian but became a successful television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting is held in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he walks down the aisle between two buildings sometimes, and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
The price of oil fell further to $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, as concerns about high stocks were balanced by a report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-hungry industry.
The American oil indicator for December deliveries fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange during the late morning.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents, and for the month of October it fell by 5,8%.
Rich oil reserves have been costing the price in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, the Department of Energy declared that US supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production gave rise to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which has risen to 7.8 percent after the past two weak decades in the third quarter.
Oil Brent, an indicator for international oil also used by American refineries, fell at the London International Trade Exchange by 26 cents at $108.58 per barrel.
Oh, no, Mr. Hasku.
We have a unique way of telling politicians that they don't.
It is necessary to put pressure on Martin Hašek to be relieved of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so low.
Martin Hasek is shielded by the promise he made, but everyone and politician must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and very much consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš has a material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program advocated by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr. Hasku, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, so if you weren't lying - here you can see how difficult it is with lying), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of a man who has made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, even erring person or a lifeless skank.
It may seem unfair to you when I address only you, but you are the leader and they are only the misguided sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to lower your ears for a little while, regroup your powers, sit this shame out, and then attack again, but that's how guerrillas or backstabers act.
You, I repeat, are the leader in your eyes, the alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court of First Instance blocked the regulation on the procedure for stopping and searching persons by the NYPD
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked a court order requiring changes in the program to stop and search persons at the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second US Federal Court of Appeal said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the appeal decision was filed by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city challenged its conclusions and its corrective regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested postponement.
The appeal court said that the judge had to be removed from the case because she had been in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge by not acting as a judge to avoid appearances of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement which she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search people.
It has established independent supervision to oversee major changes, including reform in procedures, training and supervision, and has ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body-wearing cameras in some areas where the most frequent stopping of persons occurs.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of keeping people's names and addresses, whose cases were dismissed after a police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have criticized a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there has been a pause and search of people for about a number of decades, but recorded searches under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically grown to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, mostly blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, filed an action that became a case of group action.
The advocates of changing the stopping and searching program by the NYPD claim that the changes will put an end to unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police corps, and may influence the use of these procedures by other police departments.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that money will be squandered by it, but there will not be a wider problem where the police force is under pressure after several thousand people have decreased in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people who are constitutional, but reformulated the way police departments in NY have conducted inspections.
A fifth of shopping malls are struggling with low attendance
This is based on data from the real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague Bohnice, the shopping centre Kraków opens to the public, will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Dissatisfied performance is about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large centers against the location and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and inconspicuous arrangement of passages or dead sites of centers," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also according to the head of the retail property department Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the business centers are facing low attendance.
Among the main reasons are, among other things, poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or overcrowding of the market in a given place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New business centres must try harder to attract their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," added Samadi.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable, even with some centres rising, because the landlords were willing to reduce rent in the crisis and sublet some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened up, which are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," said Soták.
Business centres open in the past two years are pushing very slowly on the market according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a market place for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called 'convinience of centrifuges', aimed at buying and serving daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
Also according to Soták there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or enlargement in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," added Soták.
In Prague they see the space for the upcoming shopping centre on Vítězný náměstí, and according to him they have clear potential of Na Příkopě street and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, enabling traders to cover and expand to increasingly smaller cities at favourable rents and operating costs, and there is also room in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or reconstruction of such shops as the reconstruction of Prior, which benefits from a good location," Dita Kubánková of DTZ added.
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of gross lettable areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, the data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check his tip.
Former editor of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods of "hacking the phone, tracking and confrontation" to confirm the fraudulent love tip that the then interior minister Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in.
Attorney Attorney Andrew Edis of the Court of Old Bailey said that the News of the World newspaper caught false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned private investigators Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but it was said in court that Coulson called her and left her voicemails.
"The state representative suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the person standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but the person who likes to push stories to see what they say," said Mr Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, he knows about the other one, the surveillance, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking the phone?
He says no, we say, "Of course he does."
The rumors about the love relationship that Clarke was involved in were first captured by the NotW News Department when the source that was sexually interested in Mrs Pawlby was said, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A record of voice mails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
While Mrs Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr Edis said.
Meanwhile, Ms Pawlby's former chief rapporteur, Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur, James Weatherup, have been overseeing the surveillance of Mrs Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, saying: "I got a story that we are about to publish tomorrow, and I would love to talk to Charles about it. "
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was, according to the same model as other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it was said that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love relationship with a married woman while he was seeing the defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiracy with other people to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking the phone.
The NSA's exposure increases the social paranoia of surveillance by the state
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Institute Protection Office (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was intended to take photographs of the roof of an American forward patrol located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event triggered an exchange of views between the US and German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, US National Intelligence Director, again insisted in September that the United States was not using its foreign intelligence options "to steal trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits"
But ever since Edward Snowden, a coworker who became an informant, began to reveal his valuable collection of classified surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading entrepreneurs, they don't know whether to trust the director's words anymore.
Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data that American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, possess, have achieved general paranoia on state-based monitoring of new dimensions.
The last straw came with the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been bugged for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the potential targets are certainly also the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has clarified intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY advisory service, German companies are convinced that as far as industrial espionage and data theft is concerned, the US is now as high a risk as China.
However, there is still no evidence in the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and stated that it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
There are voices from the German Parliament that we should produce a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly again...
That's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of SAP's German software company.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical complexity of the U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking for some companies who have so far believed that China is the greatest threat to surveillance.
There is a huge turnaround in cloud computing technology, where European leaders have realised to a wider extent that data stored in the US falls under their jurisdiction and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, around 10 percent of non-American members canceled their plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after unveiling the US Prism program.
Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, says: "Do we have a new question for customers who were not here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German senior officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets, and these data must be protected at all costs.
Economic espionage is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"It has been a major topic for many years and it has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the Agrochemical Company BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a business and industrial level, just like we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to brag about the countermeasures they have taken to possibly give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB memory disk at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car company's board, says that it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign travels because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid cell phones are then discarded.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," warns BfV in its report.
The US warns its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington post newspaper, the National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second line of perpetrators who are involved in the hacking activity for economic newsletters, right behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free company concluded that in terms of economic espionage, "the French are the worst"
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in one of the talks this month: "Services know quite well that all countries, although working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies. "
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a tangled wrestling ghost in his high school gym believe their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck in a ghostly manner behind the bleachers at the high school gym where he went.
The sheriff's investigators from the Lowndes County district concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old refuses to do so.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They believe it contradicts logic, physical laws, and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's supposed to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a body bag," he said.
Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
he declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told the journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of post-asphyxiation.
According to Moore, the second autopsy indicated another cause of death.
"There are several question marks that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he reveals enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death to order a criminal investigation or a civil rights violation, he will request the FBI and its execution.
The deputy sheriff's office at the Lowndes precinct was not immediately available for any comment on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all surveillance videos that the investigators had reviewed.
The teenage parents are hoping that the video footage will contain a clue as to how their son died.
CDC issued allergy guidelines for schools in children
In the centre of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of children allergic to food at school.
It is the first set of such directives issued by the US Government because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools on how to inform the faculty and staff about children's food allergies and how to react to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline - the most frequently used EpiPen automatic injector - in order to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child can say, "It's like someone's sticking in my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue," or "My tongue itches."
Parents of Intersexual Children Can Choose "Indefinite Sex "
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex of children born with ambiguous sexual organs.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either the male or the female.
The new law does not require parents to mention any sex for such children and allows them to refer to their birth certificates as "indeterminate" or "undefined."
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to make hasty decisions with their child for a sex operation, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person after many years said: "I am neither man nor woman. "
I'm gonna stay lab-made by a doctor, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year out of 2000 children are born one that is neither boy nor girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (eggplants or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and to determine it, instead of waiting and watching the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
A New York psychiatrist, Dr Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender problems, said that the new German law "looks like a good thing."
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
Gender determination can be performed without surgery and then it can wait to see how identity develops.
Knowledge of how a child develops sexuality is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not linked to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These features may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and figure, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sex organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the work area, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark male, female or "third sex " in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52 - year - old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person to win an appeal so that she could retain the status of "indeterminate" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports, except M (man) and F (woman), will also have a third name, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighboring France, according to the news report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove "sex theory" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic online websites have also defined themselves against German law and wrote: "With the world being dragged to a new state, when gender is a matter of choice, but not sexual activity, we are turning inside out two other pillars of civilization. "
A newborn mother from Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would rather see the children be assigned sex at birth.
"Parents themselves are stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said for the website regarding parental care.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was like a board that could be erased and redrawed.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong choice because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up because of their gender.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex was yielding.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment - how parents raised their children - had affected children's genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theory became questionable.
He recommended that the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged because of a badly executed circumcision, that they have his child castrate completely, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he went back into surgery with the boy and married a woman.
At 38 years of age, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still use "this model. "
But in the 1990s, with the Internet coming, survivors of these operations appeared "unsatisfying with the result."
It was also a case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but an ambiguous sexual tract.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfying life. "
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's surgically removed the external organs and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones when he was 12 years old.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said for ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent to a vagina sculpture at 18.
But because he was depressed and he knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
When I was born, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its sexual tract.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone and had his breast removed,
Surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents another in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the law group Advocates for informed choice, based in California, fears that the German law "calls on branding and stigmatism. "
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will reach out to encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose "indefinite" for the child," she said.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think it's better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex. "
"The adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is about to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child should not be tempted at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in support group, said that the German law "will grant jurisdiction" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has DSD called insensitivity syndrome to androgens.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie developed feminine traits.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have an uterus and ovaries.
Now, 29-year-old Katie is married, and she works as an intern in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law will give parents some space to avoid rushing their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run some tests and think about it and gives them time to write "man" or "woman."
Everything is fine in this regard - you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child, and you're enjoying it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"This brings the possibility of involving the child in the decision making and removes the anxiety that binds the parents because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child decides which sex he identifies more - and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk spilled gasoline on the whole house: He threatened to burn it down with his own family!
The tension increased, the fear escalated.
The man was threatening to burn down the whole house.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a unit of firemen from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of volunteer firefighters, have gone to the site.
The police negotiator, who tried to talk the man out of irrational behavior, also arrived at the scene.
The man continued to threaten to burn down the house.
So a task force must have entered the house, disarmed the men and cuffed them.
The aggressor then finished his examination at the Mladá Boleslav hospital, where he was transferred to the alcohol detention station.
Finally, firemen filled the house with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all pets were rescued from the house.
A man didn't put a man on a police negotiator, so a squad went after him.
Report: Obama's campaign was considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton.
President Barack Obama's closest advisor, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the coming book and announced on Thursday night that the president's top co-workers were holding intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether the disposal of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes of re-election.
According to a national political writer for Times magazine Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of campaign leaders and the White House, namely the former White House head of Bill Daley, to measure the effect that former Secretary of State Clinton would have on the election to be Vice President.
The potential change was a highly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Just a few of the president's closest advisors - including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign, Jim Messina, and former chief advisors at David Axelrod's White House and David Plouffe - knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of trying to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate wouldn't significantly increase both's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was actually considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I intensively examined a number of things, and this was one of them," he said to Daley.
You can't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we were like, "Jesus Christ, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley described research as "necessary care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the reelection campaign had made considerable investments to determine whether this move would pay off in the elections.
"There is no such money for elections and qualitative research in campaigns unless something is seriously considered," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin said for CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential card mix.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential changes, the former head of office admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe had reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama didn't know about the research to remove Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea when he read the expert treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce protein that causes lightening.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue - increases the pH of the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (lick me, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, your pH is increasing, and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it's causing this fantastic glowing effect.
She's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the lightning of a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every scoop costs me about GBP 140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
In its essence, it's impossible because of the refraction of light caused by ice crystals that make ice cream, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a cheapskate.
There haven't been any candy in my apartment for two years, and it's probably not gonna be any different this year.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year, most Americans - in fact 158 million of them - will celebrate Halloween and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to about Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion of dollars spent is expected to costume 1.2 billion.
This year, the latest fad of fashion is sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy can be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the dead parade, and I bet space men from Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans are spending $ 330 million on costumes for pets this year.
So you'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing report for 41 million carolers who, according to the US Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we'll buy, and believe it or not, we'll eat 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Candy Association, nearly 16,000 tons will be sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror behind the walls," and "The house of shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that, according to American haunted houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos where you pee in fear and your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will view the photo and write down a comment like "nice faces."
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Ever since we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving pumpkin lanterns is like decorating a Christmas tree - we've been doing it since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the trend of "baby in pumpkin" started only last year thanks to the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up to carve gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins have grown this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut up their pumpkin weighing almost one ton.
A series of racing Land Rovers notified
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as an intercommunication device.
The choice is improved brakes, service package providing access to the Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between individual plants.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The competitors of the Bowler races have changed. "
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also reachable way to world-class races.
We are pleased that we can offer them this trip in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that prepare the contestants for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
Moreover, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as an opportunity to compete in desert competitions in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
Chairman TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last one in an interview for Aktuálně.cz he said that there is no other way out, and every government arising from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the life expectancy of the beginning of the term of office within two years.
The opposition that voters will hardly choose in a completely different way next time does not agree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making. "
At the same time, the Chairman of the TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters in the next election as this year (about 300,000 votes lost compared to 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that the early elections would be, it would strengthen the ANO 2011 movement of Andrei Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will be losing.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret lanese meeting of part of the party's leadership, said that he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of social democracy, commented on Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"Head of the Democratic Party as little boys go to the head of state to allow them to revolutionize the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I have never seen something so impatiently done in my life," added Chairman TOP 09.
And toward President Zeman (with whom he met in the fight for presidential office) he suffocated: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize the party."
The first laws have already been passed by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the House, including the Farsk Register of Treaties, which were discussed before the elections by the House Committees, but fell under the table with early elections.
Chairman TOP 09 in an interview for Aktuálně.cz claims that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are needed" .
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused the TOP 09 in the election fight of the idea of introducing a register of treaties "robbing" the ANO program.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted off the proposal that was already in the second House reading.
Fire units have arrived to rescue the lost puppy, who is stuck 15 meters above ground on a dangerous protrusion in the quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a little car accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog saw him trapped in a quarry.
The firefighters fell down the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was liberated by fire units who came to rescue him after somehow being trapped on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he survived for three days alone until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) with their friend Becky Hall (20) were in the quarry of Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they searched for their lost dog and placed calls on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 14.15, a sharp-sighted dog dogger spotted a stranded Ruby on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
The tech rescue team from the fire station Cleckheaton rushed to the site and fell down to free Ruby, using a transport bag for animals to pick him up on the rock.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall - 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
During the rescue, he didn't blink - he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
He got cookies later.
It was a very unusual trip.
The sighting of a dog is unbelievable.
The technical rescue team chief Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape. "
There was a chance that he would be very seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a tour, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was afraid to see the rescue. "
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in your arms again.
The vet said if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them. Everyone was just terrific.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there. "
The fire department was great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says he wasn't out after 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song "Old Habits die hard" from 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he hit on her.
And she added: "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me. "
In a statement from Jagger's Thursday (70), the deputy said that he categorically refused to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's mistaken for someone else."
Perry was one of the visiting singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prim" debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that its entry into Schengen would be a condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU.
This gave cause to stories about passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but - as expected - this was not reflected in the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws to their satisfaction.
Since Scotland is not in Schengen now, the offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession to Brussels in return for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
Plus, he's so old, he's become a dig, a journalistic duck, that "independence means passport control" I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting thought in this bearded story.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why trade London's huddle for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The effect of the euro crisis is the so-called Europe Project officially dead.
Across Europe, the influence of dedicated opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency is gaining.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative party for Germany - founded this year - came as if out of nowhere, and already in the September federal elections captured nearly five million votes, essentially "blowing" the Free Democrats from the Bundestag (the equivalent of British Liberal Democrats).
On home soil, he always opposed the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the straitjacket applied to national economies by sticking to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are managing a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only aid is to cut revenue and public expenditure - which Germany urges.
Behind the current budgetary and currency problems, Europe's lax performance is a deeper cause.
As a result of the 'green' energy policy supported by Brussels - the code to support French and German companies at consumer costs - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol than it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have seen in the Grangemouth case.
Not even any salary freeze in the world would have prevented the stomping of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering rebellion, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a card of political legitimacy and has pushed its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right winger, the anti-European National Front, has just won major additional elections and has moved the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now, with 24% of the votes, the most popular party in France - an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the right-wing fragmentation will automatically be positive on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The next year's European elections would like to use it to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament acting against the common currency.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block can dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
It occurs to me that, in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will unite and destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn into something more freer in the sense of the "Europe (sovereign) nations," which General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Great Britain to distance itself from this project and tie itself to the United States.
However, the increased interest in Washington's Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - this also includes the possibility of announcing Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed organisation of Europe, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The government of the SNP in Scotland is - oddly enough - the most successful political movement not promoting austerity measures in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011, thanks to the opposition stance on cuts planned (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now chose independence just to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Adult Earlier
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts claim that one of the triggers of early puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so evident in boys.
CNN former rapporteur Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be terrified when her daughter's breasts and hair begin to grow to shame at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development such as breast growth, pubic hair and armpits and body odor appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been a slight shift in the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, it is now an average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years will pass before the first menstruation," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Time puberty in girls: A necessary guide to handling this common problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
There is a discussion about what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before the 8th year of age, the girl is considered to be "prematurely mature."
In most cases, the process will slow or stop - which can be carefully monitored by children's doctors.
Faster growth may be a reason for endocrinologists to perform tests in order to rule out serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to a stop to growth and dwarfness in adulthood.
Drug recommendations and hormonal treatments depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
As far as drug use is concerned, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he acknowledges that "repression of puberty can alleviate the problems of a girl's behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers. "
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are worried that he may become pregnant or how he will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter began her period at age 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no consistent set of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys - like girls - reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that obesity epidemic is the most serious reason.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 who combine body fat with puberty timing.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything possible from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although the hair in the face and shame appear in the boys at a low age, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as it is in the girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Children's Physicians (AAP) have added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We must be careful as to how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from their child's physician on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean a need to talk to the child sooner than you would expect," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who have evolved before need to be assured that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalink in the role of pub.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalink (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of pubist and she was very good at it.
Did the favourite Czech actress plan to change her profession and go into a business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalink showed up at James Joyce Irish pub making beer.
I've done it for the first time in my life, and I was good at it.
Even the boss offered to hire me to make a living by spinning beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I do today, with acting," Konvalinková said, smiling, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey every now and then," the actress told her tastes.
Nadi's longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I'm not allowed to drink in this new life.
I am allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I am trying to follow that," added the actor.
Aircraft manufacturers fight for seat width, big orders are at stake
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, a dispute over the width of second class seats for long-distance flights has been heated, which has given rise to a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show this month.
The subject matter of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-distance flights for the economic class - not the one normally preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week Airbus called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says that airlines should decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-distance aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is distributed - especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats side by side - is the basis of economic performance requirements for the design of new "mini-jumbo" aircraft.
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" will deliver 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will deliver 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public before the Dubai air show, where it is expected that 777X will prevail with more than 100 orders.
He recently previewed what might be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a picture of three people stuck in a restaurant with the headline "Would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in narrower seats than they are in regional turboprop aircraft," said the sales manager of Airbus John Leahy.
As the food nagging changes, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes haven't changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, the weight of an average American aged between 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent by the turn of the century, according to US Health Ministry.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century is 100 cm in the waist.
Airbus claims that his rival held to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it has conducted research that suggests that extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing's dimensions of seats reject Airbus and say that it is not within the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It really is about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe must be done to be successful," said Kent Craver, an expert on cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, greater room for elbows is essential, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute, the aircraft ordering race with estimated trade over the next decades is worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to deflect the weight of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, the layout of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing argue that they are achieving 20 percent better efficiency in their latest two-engine long-range aircraft designs than market leaders in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend partly on the comparison of the 777X model design with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seater concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to fill up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products," said Kevin Kenyan, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Forty-five centimeters wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus, the design is motivated by the threat of model 777," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Travellers even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive arrangement.
While comfort is being enjoyed, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a high density arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a larger cab modification by offering wider seats in the alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard, but may discourage the sales wave of 777X.
The number of HIV infected exceeded a thousand in Prague
The number of infected in the Czech Republic is growing every year.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later 121 and 180 in 2010.
Last year, 212 were infected, and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, which I think is no doubt," said the AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led Prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country from January to September last year, with 176 patients in the same period this year.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005.
In the Central Bohemia Region, 206 were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian or 116 from Ústecký.
The least infected are from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people in the past have been infected with blood transfusions.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, transferred from their mother to them.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, the experts say.
A fantastic film from space Gravitation sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic for some time after the premiere.
In October, almost 150,000 viewers saw him and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
Others, however, find certain irregularities in it.
The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I like science-fantastic films, which I consider modern, dream fairy tales.
The film Gravity doesn't include, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which does not somehow float in a weightless state.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Stations are moving on significantly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film account for the unrealistic effect and the entire behaviour of the fire in a weightless state.
They don't think the suits could withstand that kind of blow.
Heroes in the movie Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and suits without any major problems will last.
The criticism was not spared even the plot plot.
Such an extensive tragedy in Earth's orbit is, according to some, unrealistic.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair technology.
People in the forums argue about the "unreal" behavior of ropes.
They say it feels like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the City of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen, but I can clearly say I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost the duty) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than the irregularity mentioned by you, I was touched by how three times a space station with a degraded level of technology (the last Chinese level) is shown."
"The Chinese will not be until the end of the decade and will probably look better than they are in the film."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer generated scenes, the authors try very successfully not to break physical laws, and so the natural-oriented viewer appreciates that in various cosmic collisions and collisions the moment of momentum, to say the dictionary physics, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the polar glow flickering on polar regions.
Irregularities are certainly found during a more detailed examination.
For example, when I read the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic rubbish in orbit appears reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (an employee of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Astronomical Institute): Some things the creators have adapted to their needs, but none of the fundamentals, and I have not noticed any violations against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus it is obvious that the creators have relied on the credibility of the displayed events.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth mentioning the fact that Hubble's space telescope orbits beyond the ISS.
As a result, there is a very different mutual speed and a rescue operation could therefore not actually take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, in the moment of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) department, I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go when they are no longer moving towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine can remove the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
There are further tests to be done before human trials, which take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that it can overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce antinicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies are pursuing all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralizing them before they enter the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine shot.
During tests of the vaccinated mouse to which nicotine was additionally delivered, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren't vaccinated "calm down" said researchers, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
Experiments are described in Science Translation Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain adequate levels of antibodies, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, children could be given before they want to try a cigarette, thus avoiding nicotine addiction.
But it is much more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They will know that when they start smoking again, they will have no benefit because of the nicotine vaccine, and this will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Supervisory Committee.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of coastal lease at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to rent him a bicycle Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, without having to participate in a tender after its expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on the evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pressured the leases to enter public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, leases for the companies in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in the competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rental policy.
The transcription of the calls submitted in the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr Obeid in the fishing department.
"Was the topic of the talks during these telephone calls the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty Mr Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible officer
Israeli military aircraft hit the target on Thursday night in the Syrian port of Lazikija, confirmed by the responsible administrative officer of Fox News.
This responsible factor specifically did not say what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The press agency Associated Press reports that the SA-125 rockets were targeted by Russian production.
At least twice before this year, Israel conducted an air strike on the supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and they're different.
For example, commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that he could agree with it, while President Štěch was stirring up discord.
Hetman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek made the most impossible interview on television.
On this basis, I see no better option than for ČSSD to propose Vice-President of the Senate Gajdůšková as Prime Minister, the only one who would not have had an initial disability, and I think it would have done a standard performance.
That's such a good solution, it's hardly anyone in charge to support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could without fear establish a minority government with only a blessing from President Babiš and without the people, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a believing social democrat.
This minimalist government would have great stability because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and the President of the Dawn of Okamura has committed himself to supporting it.
President Babiš would eventually accept tax progress, for he is bright and will see that he can't do it without her.
The People's Party wouldn't be a problem, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't have been in the government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, even here a valuable minister would be found, but if they do not reasonably want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, also well.
Let's give Alena Gajduska some courage!
Foreign visa workers may be subject to a "legality" test
As the government intends to extend police interventions, the "legality" test for foreign workers with a 457 visa authorisation is considered.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through the middle of the criteria in order to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fulfil unqualified positions, or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour Member Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers with the words that it might offend Australian neighbors.
"Loud statements by foreigners at the end of the queue" and "work first for Australians" are a very unpleasant relic from the time the unions demanded a protected labour market," she said today for the Australia-Indian Institute.
Historically, it meant that the white workforce was to be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in this region recorded the echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
The immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he deals with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and others remain to be considered.
If the criteria for "legality' are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail as to whether "the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or a personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking'.
After previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers, but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35 - year - old man from Sri Lanka who sought asylum died of a heart attack this week after arriving on an asylum ship in the Christmas Islands.
A man's nine - year - old frightened son traveled to Australia along with him, and after his father's death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat.
The Australian authorities and the man rushed to the hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said that the project "will unite Great Britain together".
The Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said that he was "excited" by working with the British Government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase Two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which interviewed the National Transport Scotland Transport Office, commissioned HS2 to identify additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that better connects Great Britain and its cities. "
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also a connection - through Great Britain, thanks to HS2 18 cities will be better connected, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. "
Under the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "clearly" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed track has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railroads across Britain. "
So we are enthusiastically working with the British Government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed railroads to Scotland and thus bring benefits to all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British ministers, in the next year and to making a joint decision on the next steps.
Along with Barta, the inspection and anti-corruption police analyst arrested
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday night, when the report was brought by the server Firstzpravy.cz.
MF TODAY soon found out that the case was in charge of the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS), her people were to arrest Bartu in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection shall address cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its jurisdiction shall also apply to civil persons.
According to MF Today, among the arrested and one of the anti-corruption police officers is Jan Petržílek, head of analysts and informatics.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
A spokesperson for anti-corruption police Jaroslav Ibehei refused to comment on the fact that the media had to turn to GIBS on this matter.
But even her spokesperson for the inspector Radka Sandorová did not want to say anything about the case, she referred to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Zenklová said.
Also from this unspecific reaction, it can be deduced that the event took place, but it is under cover, which does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that Bartu represents "even in this matter," but given that it's classified information, Bart cannot confirm or disprove the arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police President Petr Lessy.
This was promoted by Bart, together with former VV President Radek John, who was head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute, which was due to this, started between Prime Minister Petr Nečas and VV, had even to be resolved by the then president Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about it," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but he was Bart at the time.
Barta was now running for the election for the Dawn movement, the parliamentary mandate escaped him only briefly - by 175 votes.
The leader of Dawn Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what it was.
"Vít Bárta was one of many candidates for many parties on our list and, as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who told before the elections that he had given Bart the space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the executors.
Vít Barta was in court in 2012 with his former VV partner Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment in an aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers from Australian airlines will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones while starting and landing, regardless of changes in the US, in order to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given US companies space to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the equipment stays in the "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot have access to their electronic books during launch and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers in order to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by the regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from crew members.
Virginia, who had already talked to CASA about extending the use of its on-board wi-fi entertainment system, was inclined to change but announced that it would be subject to the regulatory authority's decision.
"We would like CASA to analyse the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment), this would improve customer experience," said the speaker.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," he said.
FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in regulatory developments that may be useful for our passengers, and we will certainly thoroughly review the FAA's decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of air carriers from the USA, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their aviation fleet.
Transporters will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
"As soon as the airline confirms its fleet's tolerance, passengers can use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases, low visibility, the crew will order passengers to disable the device during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment be safely placed under the seats or in the storage area above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
Janani Amirthalinga stops the gold bracelet, ring and earrings at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore so she can pay her daughter tuition fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house and put all my money into it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 each month as an administrator (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across regions in Southeast Asia - where household debt is increasing - is that ValueMax, where a woman conducts its transaction, has become the third pawn shop on the list in Singapore this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash - 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income and can provide a loan faster than banks.
Therefore, as families feel pressure because of the rising cost of life and the rising debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turn to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to cope with a worsening financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's quoted the increasing use of domestic credit mainly due to increasing rents as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, in view of their gross domestic product, the highest household debt in Asia.
Malaysia is on the forehead with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has simply come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The important thing is that, with rising costs, people from middle to low [income scale] will try to replenish their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Bank of Malaysia.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are quick to stop their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and we get it back next month.
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
The growth in the pawnshop industry is so great that ValueMax, an operator of a branch in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia - where it has four branches - but also outside Asia, says the executive director of ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it acquired on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors have been under attack by criticism over high interest rates, Mrs Yeah says that the pledge offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers stop items that they already own, and moneying personal property does not increase household debt," he says.
In society, property pledges are increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, people who use pawnshops are not just in financial distress.
The wealthy Singaporean people also use ValueMax when they stop the gold rods or Rolex watch to reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible circumstances.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their brave business or investment, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow," says Mrs Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as fast as possible.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for the dying health in Tasmania contains harsh conditions to ensure that the government does not waste money.
Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, has announced that the Australian Union is taking "accelerated measures" to avert the crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for four years was decided following government consultations with an independent Tasmanian Member, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government came up with an emergency rescue package which, we believe, will solve the specific problems facing the state," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at patient's request.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help to eliminate debt.
Money is also available in free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinicians have told me to help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting regime and accounting obligations.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Australian Union and report monthly on where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State supplies services as efficiently as possible.
Today, Mr Wilkie said that $325 million will be useless "until real reform is followed in order to lay a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system. "
Nevertheless, he commended the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first made in negotiations with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I believe that a federal aid package can extricate public health" said Mr Wilkie.
According to the government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
A spokesman for the federal opposition in the health field, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is just a "plug."
"The reason why I'm here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that spends $300 million, and pretends it's good news.
Mr Dutton has called on Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package will be spent on a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted the novel Denise Diderota, which brings an exceptional film expedition and representation of the time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 1860s in France and tells a grim story about Suzanne, a young noble woman who is sent by her family to a monastery.
When he rebels, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the criminally depraved mother superior and for another he becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film never slides to lust or sensation, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial image of this story results in the viewers experiencing torture similar to wearing a sackcloth shirt.
Ski resorts want to make families with children cheaper
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons facilities, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, said on Thursday the Committee on Global Chemical Weapons Supervision, while violent conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where poisonous substances are supposed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian Activist Group also stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
Announcement of the Chemical Weapons Ban Organization came the day before November 1st,
the date set by Damascus, based in The Hague, to destroy or prevent the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing chemicals for the purpose of creating poisonous gas and filling ammunition.
Completion of this basically initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday the fighting in Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of the chemical weapons and storage plant, was reported by the Syrian human rights observer based in Britain.
A group of activists, who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
This is supposed to be 61.067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side it is 29,954 members of the forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among the killed are also 2.202 government defectors and approximately 5.375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations organization estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observer stated on Thursday that the losses were on both sides but did not have specific figures.
The fighting underlined the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission, have to get rid of the chemical arsenal in the middle of Syria's ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW, which closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that his team was now "satisfied to verify - and monitor the destruction - of the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling'.
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned'.
Previously this week, inspectors said that they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two sites, according to Syria, were "abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons programme contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked'.
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those sites that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organisation has ever had," said Ahmet Uzumcu, Director of Observers in his commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with their security forces full of the Alawite sect, are facing each other in the civil war.
As regards further developments, the head of the Watcher Ramí Abdul Rahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion within the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the judgment handed down by the Bali bomber
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 responded furiously to the judgment handed down by the last of the curriculumrs who were brought to justice and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people remained dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded life imprisonment, although she could have insisted that a man with the name "Demolition man" was given the death penalty thanks to his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack triggered by Patek and other curriculumrs almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs Corteen said: "It should be built in front of a firing squad. "
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was flattened when a heavy charge was launched shortly after 23 o'clock in a parked van outside on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a backpack full of explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and as he was kept alive, he "died " three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islami cell responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get a death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, there just isn't.
Getting 20 years to kill 202 people and hurt hundreds more isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He avoided arrests for nearly ten years, but was finally apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later American forces killed the former leader of Al Qaeda Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect between the terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can still appeal to the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technology supplies on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from gate to gate" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the impatiently expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers are not to expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to individual airlines, said the FAA administrator Michael Huerta at the press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the cabin crew and the equipment storage instructions to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted the plans.
"We can improve the extended use of electronic equipment very quickly depending on the state of such a plan," the FAA said in its statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of three kilometers, and the captain gives no permission.
Passengers are expected to shut down their devices again when the plane is falling to land and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are correctly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and taxiing, indicated the FAA.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitude are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as the new rules are safely introduced - and we will work closely with the transport companies - it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
Honestly, we're tired of looking like babysitters.
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be banned under 3 kilometers of altitude, said the Agency.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, fired from American Airlines' aircraft because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored for fear that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using mobile phones are not defined by the FAA, but by the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may revoke the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker, a national transport security expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that in the air they can cause interference with broadcasting towers," Rosenker said.
In order to examine this problem, the FAA's trade advisory committee proposed last month that the government allow for wider use of electronic equipment.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democrat of Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such equipment is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget the obligation to disable or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radios, technical achievements of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but they are also designed, and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi in travel altitudes.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic equipment under the new rules, said Huert.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasts than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers issue only minimal broadcasts when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the device downloads or transmits data.
Amazon.com is among those who are pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the transport plane with Kindle electronic readers and made a test flight, but there was no problem.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Passengers of Airlines said that he believes that the interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause air systems to be disrupted, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut down their equipment during low visibility flight.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and it is a reasonable procedure for the travelling public, which uses technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One rattled was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue center until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: "This rattle probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught it over the North Sea. "
Apparently, he ran out of power and found refuge on an oil rig.
He added: "He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted with a request for help. "
By the time he was rattled, he was in good shape and well.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to combine businesses and define what changes British businessmen and employment companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we have asked leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see how the government favors new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting caught up in a long and strenuous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulations to product laws - most entrepreneurs expressed the view that checking these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the cost of Brussels regulations now outweighs the benefits of being part of the European business area - even 40 percent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European companies, expressed their consent.
Finally, our survey of leading companies revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a change in the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings identified by businesses of different sizes and major business groups show that the business sector is pushing for a "sensual change" that will transfer its influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake - achieving a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% in the referendum for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and, given the way the eurozone is heading for a closer economic and fiscal union, it is becoming increasingly necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and, as our research results show, it means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry confessed: Spying went too far!
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, according to AFP, John Kerry, head of American diplomacy, admitted during the video conferencing between Washington and London.
According to the Minister, however, the collection of information was used to avert terrorist attacks.
According to AFP, the first confession from Washington was made in the midst of a violent controversy on both sides of the Atlantic due to scandalous revelations about mass data monitoring by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the target of which was also American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President did (Barack Obama), some of these events have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," said Kerry.
In the interview, however, he defended the practice.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings exploded and people were murdered because we were able to be informed about the schemes in time," Kerry emphasized.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far. "
The affair around American intelligence, which allegedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turns out that the Americans also tracked the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
Europe's leaders did not hide the indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to ban or significantly restrict monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Director Gazprom.
"Today we are witnessing the milestone: Construction started on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of the European continent's energy security.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says officials.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.
Once the entire project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that construction is to start at the end of this year in other countries in the direction of flow.
The gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese movement Hezbollah deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to Israel's still-defining reports, during Wednesday's raids, two locations in Western Syria destroyed the missiles designated by Hezbollah.
This Lebanese Shia organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere with the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it would prevent the transfer of arms to Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday's Israeli raids on weapons warehouses in Western Syria are yet to be specified.
Israel didn't comment on the attack, but American sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakija.
Al-Arabiya News Station claims that two warehouses were hit in which the missiles were ready for transport to Lebanon.
According to its sources, they were rockets from Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force teaches members of the armed section of Hezbollah to handle missiles.
SA-8 are outdated rockets that the Syrian army has had since the '80s.
They're placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, mobility and small dimensions make it easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar that shuts down after the missile is fired, so it's hard to locate them.
Latakija lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by ruling allavits.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in Western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shia community to which they belong.
Now, apparently, 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the army back Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and Homs' third largest city.
The battle is to be a retaliation, according to the source of al-Arabiya, for the recent attack of the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade of the Fadla Abbas in Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many insurgents from Kusajru just left for Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, spending money on overpriced purchases and public procurement, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals have been cited as reasons.
The results of the elections suggest that the majority of the citizens were in a position to do so.
That they were actually okay with it and with the state that was here (stealing and indebting this state) they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not vote, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS in total 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1,016,829 to the above-mentioned parties to the ČSSD electorate, then to the old order (because all the parties involved in the "breaking up" and indebtion of this state), 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed to this situation.
In fact, most voters have made it clear that they are not in favour of punishing the culprits of this state's robbery and debt.
Or do you think that the ČSSD members who have participated in this will take the right laws?
Is it even helping us?

The Vatican wants to know how Catholic parishes around the world approach sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce, and homosexual couples.
The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) were charged before the proceedings against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children before the charges were brought against child tutor Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011.
But it was said before the Commission that in its opening statement to the Commission, this association stated that they had never dealt with a child's sexual abuse case in their organization.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case where one of the employees of the YMCA association was accused of child pornography offences, and about another when the gym teacher at Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the committee advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA which appreciated this organisation as a leading supporter of children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission indicates that YMCA has been made aware that it has received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society of August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that leadership from him down the road had failed when he accepted Mr. Lord without making sure that the staff was aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment by 12 boys committed during the two years he worked in the YMCA association.
He's been incarcerated for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare refused to claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting a child security breach by Mr. Lord.
The staff showed evidence that they witnessed such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, guarding them privately, letting them sit on their laps, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was a subordinate to Lord and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the YMCA Children's Service in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to" about something.
The CEO said he didn't accept personnel evidence that they felt uncomfortable to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord clouded their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said that he told the YMCA Board of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson of Jonathan Lord's case to the organization was that the staff "did not report" and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the accusations occurred was made by the general manager for services to children in the YMCA organization Liam Whitley.
He said that the aim was to avoid breach of evidence, but it was "exaggerately zealous " and misguided.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the committee that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, processing, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned on December 20th.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the prime minister's post, but he admitted that coming back was unlikely.
In a night conversation on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, 59-year-old politicians expressed their views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned ten years later, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, his answer was as follows: "Yes, of course, but that's hardly going to happen, so... "
While there were crowds of experts gathered in Cardiff to show off horses to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to all that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he hasn't gone to school yet, and only a few months ago he took his first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, have smoothed through three laps to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 towing adult rivals.
This inseparable pair - with the same height - was praised for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank riding centre in the village of Rudra near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret into a cheerful angle and had his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circuit.
Fenton was praised for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
He got Fenton Toffee on his third birthday in March, and he's been practicing with this Shetland pony every day ever since.
His mother, Donna (30), said: "Fenton and Toffee work well together. "
They didn't get their hopes up, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone considered him phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
The boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing off horses for more than 10 years.
Says Mrs Howells: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded. "
He ran along the sand throughout the arena and even though he was so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors, and a farm and got two chickens in charge.
Given the way he started, he'll be back soon at the Horse of the Year competition, and I'm sure he'll do well.
" The Fentons are only three, " said the spokesperson for the annual horse show, "but he knows how to control a pony. "
They make a great team.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they showed up on the circuit.
They're always watching how good teamwork is between the pony and whoever's running it, and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped, really fit in with him.
Too much inquisitive newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which requested the release of a reporter accused of slander on the front page, will be thoroughly investigated, said the Press Administrator.
New Express, based in Guangzhou, has made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But later on, Mr Chen admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to invent stories about a state-owned company.
The warden said that the New Express newspaper will now make a "full correction. "
The regulation on "correction" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in the Province of Guang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that during the period from September 2012 to August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng Group Evening News published several false reports on Zoomlion.
"The directorial management of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," he said in his statement to the administrator.
He said he had to decide "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a cancellation of a journalistic license."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to make a complete correction to the New Express newspaper, and recommended that they investigate the responsible people in New Express and immediately change the New Express lead"
Mr Chen wrote several articles for New Express concerning financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed that he was behind his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on national television and confessed to publishing false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," CCTV said.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I was wrong.
After Mr Chen's apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page stating that he failed when he failed to check his reports sufficiently.
Recently, several high-profile suspects have made a confession on TV.
Experts say that confessions are still being enforced on a regular basis, regardless of the amendment of this year's law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel was found for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico was discovered, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railroad.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel about one by one meter in size as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors ever discovered.
A tunnel that turns into nearly six football fields connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses where trucks can easily be hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities reported that the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also intercepted eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of a conviction, they face prison sentences from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate large drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico, which puts a problem before drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor about 650 metres in length equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and the Centre connect management.
They offer, for example, a joint advertisement
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia took the next step to transform the Centrum holding into its media home.
Since Friday, Economia and Centrum have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media house," comments Economie's Vice-Chairman and appointed CEO Kamil Čermák.
The Čermák, who will lead the unified management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Holding Centre Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed the new joint director of the trade, who is also subject to the advertising director of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editors is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team also includes the Director for Transformation Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts has been entrusted with the newly established function of Marketing Director.
Věra Lhotská is running a separate department of corporate communication.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the content of all published titles and, last but not least, to make the company's business management more efficient," Čermák added.
The company Economia, owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract for the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of other nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Economic News, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly Respekt and Economist and the number of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Among the Czech publishers is the most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles for the long term.
This June, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Prague's Karlín.
CME will focus on TV business.
They're releasing almost a quarter of people.
The media group CME will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to slim down by a thousand people.
He's going to cut off all the secondary activities, and he just wants to focus on his main business, television.
The group, which owns Nova television in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs around 4 500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of the CME is CET 21, which holds a licence for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of MTV.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs roughly 650 people, and what it will mean for the domestic TV number one TV Nova, is not clear yet.
"This is premature and we really can't comment," said the director of communication Novy Josef Koukolíček.
According to the information of MF DNES, significant redundancies of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have far the greatest impact on the personnel states of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both the new bosses of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined after long-time director Adrian Sarbu, during Wednesday's conference conversation with analysts, talked about wanting to limit all activities that are directly unrelated to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
The cooling tower burned down at night in the industrial area of ČKD in Prague
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague there was a large storage tank, according to firefighters probably a cooling tower.
"Firemen left for the fire on Thursday before 11:00 p.m., this morning the fire was extinguished," said Pavlína Adamcová, spokesperson of the Prague firemen.
The amount of pollutants in the ambient air according to the measurement did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the Kolbenova street.
"This is a fire of a large storage tank, probably cooling towers," said Adamcová.
"There is no functional hydrant network on the premises, so we are putting out transport lines from cisterns," she added.
According to server tn.cz, the firefighting complicated the malfunctioning network of hydrants, which is why firemen had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The firefighter's intervention commander has issued a second level fire alarm.
There are four grades, and in the most serious situations, the fourth is announced.
Even chemists went to the scene to verify the levels of dangerous substances that could have been blown up in the fire.
"However, they did not measure in the air the amount of pollutants that would exceed hygiene standards," said the firefighter's spokesman.
British police have delivered an extradition announcement to Assange
The British police today delivered an announcement about the release of the founder of WikiLeaks to Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that he had delivered a "release notice " to a 40 - year - old Australian, asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not, he might be under arrest.
Assange, under the British law, has exhausted his options when the Supreme Court canceled his appeal against extradition this month and is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes.
Because he feared Stockholm would send him to the US, on June 19, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he asked this South American country for asylum.
Scotland Yard "taught the extradition notice to a 40 - year - old man who was asked to come to the police station on the day and hour he was assigned " said the speaker.
Assange continues to violate bail.
The Embassy has refused to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange is afraid of being released from Sweden to the United States where he can face charges of espionage because he posted 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree in Essex was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found out he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester Howie Police Court, he confessed to accusing himself of driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month ban on proceedings.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 and a £100 premium for the defendant.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the proceeds of financial assets, but is waiting for Mr Osborne's final decision, which introduced in the 2012 budget a fee of 7% for the transfer of real estate for buildings worth over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds of the property transfer fee in the housing fund in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "In view of the increase in the transfer of property in high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high value assets are undertaxed regardless of the effect of an outdated head tax system. "
He added that "this step could have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy properties in London, or that existing owners are reluctant to sell".
The front properties - the upper 5% to 10% of the housing market according to the price - in a rich belt ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw an increase of a record-breaking 11.8% last year.
Central London prices continue to show a steady growth of 5.6% year after year, but were overshadowed by the booming "home market" in which, according to a survey by Savills, they experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6,5%) growth.
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are related to the dog's mood
Early research has shown that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's perspective), while nervous dogs wave their tails mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can record these fine differences in tail movement and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: "People are well known to have different connections between the left and right of the brain to stimuli that stimulate positive or negative emotions. "
We tried to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that, like humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs react to the uneven wagging of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and other times to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version or in the form of silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we also managed to adjust the tail movement and illustrate it more to the right or left. "
When the animals saw an otherwise bland dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), they remained absolutely calm.
But when she recorded her tail shooting mostly to the left (from the dog's wagging tail view again), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which moves they must and do not have to watch out for.
He said: "If you meet dogs several times and their tail moves in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement of transport produces less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience. "
Researchers say that findings can help owners of dogs, veterinarians and trainers understand their animals' emotions better.
The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a university veterinary teacher at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side is important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left as they watched an aggressive dog, and on the right when they were looking at a jolly dog.
And in another professional treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: "Dogs are more likely to get acquainted with dog robots when they wriggled their tails to the left than to the right, when they became more insecure - exactly the opposite of an Italian study. "
According to him, the difference can be due to the fact that dogs in these various studies did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots entirely as dogs.
He explained that studies on how dogs react to real dogs could help.
"Although in the case of many different mammals there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side or another.
Arctic Monkeys due to Alex Turner's illness moved the concert in Glasgow
The Arctic Monkeys rock band moved the concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with larynx inflammation.
Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform on Friday at Hydro City Complex.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis on 22 February was the first to appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope, and they are the ones who vote for the Pope, so František will appoint his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the Pope's election - a group shrinks to 120 cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, spokesperson for the Vatican, said that before the ceremonial promotion of the new cardinals, a gathering of contemporary cardinals known as the Constory will be held.
"Pope Francis decided to give his decision to convene the February Constory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require Cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero, of the Catholic Voices, said that the number of cardinal voters will likely fall by February.
He said that the Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes for the number of voters to rise again to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
Constory next year will be significant because it will be the first after František was elected in March of this year, he said Valero.
At this point, there is a certain orientation towards Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope has decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it is "quite possible" that these cardinals the Pope would ask for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is absolutely new.
Valero said that the Popes traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he's naming".
GM downloads some new light trucks in the US due to the repair of seat backs
According to Friday's announcement from the U.S. Auto Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading almost 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to correct the failure with manual tilting of the seat-back.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may have a fault.
As a result, seat-backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
The notification placed on the website of the National Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that "if the car gets hit from behind, the head restraint may not protect the passenger correctly, which increases the risk of injury'.
The downloaded models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
GM launched the supply in June and for this leading U.S. automaker it is the most important launch of the vehicle since the restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the supply of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not review the announcement to owners due to the 16-day malfunction of the government, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
During the first 10 months of this year, sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were revised for 2014 models, increased to around 20 percent, declared GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
New York Stock Exchange stock increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Obama's Vote's Desperate Cry
I voted for Obama twice - I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have ruined the obstructions of the Republican Party
Obstruction policy cannot excuse the hardships of Obama's health care website or the attacks of unmanned aircraft
The 2008 Obama campaign's memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me during my second year's gloomy days at medical school and restore a little hope in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a memory of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reports tonight and go to bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The elections ended with an overwhelming supremacy, and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept the newspapers they had found.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
Obama had 82 percent support during his commission in 2008.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a rough awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic days - they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Years after I threw in my first ballot, there really were changes.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I admit that Obama has achieved many great and diverse achievements - from the law on available care to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the "no questions, no words" policy after Osama bin Laden's death.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, public choice of health care and closure of the base in Guantánamo.
But after many situations in which I defended Obama's administration from my colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The Republicans' obstructions cannot explain their consent to eavesdropping on foreign leaders or the drones that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot be explained by the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on American private life, nor that it haunts those who expose the government's wrongdoing.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process, or for reducing public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... from Nixon's administration."
And most recently, they cannot excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if that's something to be expected.
Whether I should have known when I was 18 years old that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The function is obviously not predictable, and our public talks will shape opposition political parties and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and uncut alternative, and he didn't seem to be able to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes we once heard of.
Nevertheless, the return to 2008 - with Obama's support falling below 45% this week - is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
They make me remember the many promises that have vanished.
This week I read a chapter in the book on how Obama suffered a devastating defeat with Clinton during the primary in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to his pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are entirely the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave program.
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave program, because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
A mining tycoon who runs a dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax bill made this claim when he tried to remove the question of whether he was in conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether coal taxes and mining activities should be collected.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
"He got into a huge conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters were to become pregnant, he would be directly interested in whether she would receive parental leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election of the electoral commission, after the votes were converted, she officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the fight for the Fairfax district in Sunshine Coast thanks to 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of election results to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the polls?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into your computer, vote immediately and get results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, can you erase the results if someone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Election Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new work "very seriously."
Public service is a public service.
"We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that hand washing will change your mood.
98 persons, divided into three groups, participated in the experiment.
The first two had a task to solve an unsolvable task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failure seemed more optimistic than the one where their participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the "washed-handed" group did better in the next test than the other one.
Yet those who washed their hands have achieved worse results in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results of the "washy' were at the level of a third group whose participants did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, physical cleanliness eliminates really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, motivation decreases, testing must concentrate much more in the next tests.
If we were to transfer the research results to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic when we got back from the WC.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but it is a fifth on the way by public transport.
After work in the garden or in the workshop, 85 percent of people usually cling to hygiene.
Pet caressing motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, as much as it is necessary to wash hands after handshaking a stranger.
In this situation, 28,8% of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I am afraid that reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," said the skin doctor Claudia Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by supervisory authorities concerning suspicious monetary-market Machinations is becoming increasingly frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with competent authorities in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where they change USD 5.3 trillion each day.
The two traders would be the first employees of RBS suspended in the context of an expanding investigation to respond to the LIBOR-handling scandal (London's interbank interest rate).
The bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our constant search continues in this matter and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other institutions," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event reported that RBS had handed over e-mails and text messages to the British Financial Behavior Authority, sent from the accounts and to the accounts of a former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European President of foreign currency trading with JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President of Money Trading in Citi, has taken a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former Currency Manager in Barclays and UBS, has been suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders was charged with any offense.
Mr. Usher's quick-message group included the Barclays and Citigroup bankers, people who were privy to this event.
UBS stated this week that, following the notification by the Swiss supervisory authority of Finma that it had investigated suspicious Machinations in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against some of its employees.
Worldwide, at least six offices - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Office of Weko, the FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the USA and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong - are examining the claim that these bankers were conspiring to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also initiated internal investigations or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks have been combing each other's old, fast messages and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have alerted traders in an area that has been one of the largest engines for generating profits in investment banks' accounts in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the fact that small currency volatility has reduced opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the gravity of the situation when they claimed that the large and highly liquid foreign currency market was virtually impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this does not necessarily have to be true.
A high-ranking trader said that, despite the considerable volume of day-to-day trading in a foreign currency, the dissipation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you can start to affect the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she released a trader from her stock trading department this week, which, at the end of last year, caused a loss of nearly USD 6 million.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the survey in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease of a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 were still infected throughout the Czech Republic.
There's already been an outbreak of immunity failure in 396.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased annually in the last decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009 the examination revealed 156 new diseases and then 180 in 2010.
Last year the number fell to 153, but last year it was record-breaking.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, which I think is no doubt," says the AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led Prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011 the tests revealed a disease in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavatý.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has erupted in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected was in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to meet a town should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the nachanic center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal the chest.
Many people "read from the graves. "
Cemeteries roam slowly and gain intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities they are, what beliefs they are, what big and coherent families they belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the condition of the graves, they will also find out how the survivors care for their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The US Supreme Court has ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a crucial victory for the Obama administration.
With a vote ratio of 5:4 the court decided that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection Act and available care - ordering citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or threatening to pay a fine - does not contradict the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
Judge John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judge Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court of First Instance also supported the remaining parts of the Law on 2700 pages and further held that the legal requirement for health care, which requires states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise all financing of sickness insurance from federal sources is imminent, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have brought an action to block this law.
During the primary year 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the anticipated proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a limp ass," there is no longer a threat of prison, the court has abolished the law
Until now, the Zimbabwans have had to pay close attention to the public talk of the 98 - year - old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and since the end of 1987 has been leading it.
According to paragraph 33 of the Penal Code, a fine of $100 to one year in prison was threatened for disrespecting the Presidential Office.
"State representatives should not be zealously accusing people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," said the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, informed the British BBC.
A number of zimbabwan victims, among them Tendai Danga, arrested by police two years ago for alleged insult to the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, he ended up in prison with an opposition activist who was part of Mugabe's public service by calling him "a limp ass."
Then in August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year-old man of his intention to use Robert Mugabe's poster as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove false," said the Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe's law has allowed a person who discloses false information to be sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.
"The existence of a law allowing someone to criminalize for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Despite Mugabe's hard-handed rule over the country for more than 33 years, in March, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties on the basis of a referendum.
A small step away from the dictatorship of one man, the country began in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj into the Prime Minister's chair.
However, the country continues to be plagued by the economic crisis and by 2008 the world's highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government therefore completely abolished the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe, only the currencies of other states are paid.
Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform is to blame for the impoverished economy.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience running the farm.
Central banks will hold swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economist of London's Barclays Bank.
"So far all transitional instruments of this type have become permanent, so it is not surprising in my opinion," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first stalled.
Central bank agreements have allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
Central bankers' decisions come at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its US economy support program, which could drive the price of money out of the global market even higher.
The swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity gap of one currency in the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be seen as a deposit of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
Over a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn't finish it after that, because someone at the branch just sat down who couldn't finish the online registration.
And since I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration expired, then I moved and my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn't, because I have another OP number, an address, and that I simply couldn't finish it and that I should request deletion of the data and make a new registration.
That is what I did and 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
On that rainbow day, she wrote me technical support to finish the registration at the branch.
This started the e-mail marathon for technical support, where after the 4th emergency, 25.10. they wrote that personal data was deleted at my request.
So you would think that he could do the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my user name is already occupied (it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but eventually excluded this).
So I used another user name and it jumped to me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that says they deleted?), so I again contacted technical support.
On my question, how is that possible, they wrote me back that the personal data was actually erased on 25.10. and that I would send an email with the error.
I did that (at about 15 o'clock yesterday) and they wrote me back today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why I could not because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I have been contacting technical support for a week and dealing with them that I still can't.
And what if what they say is true (as it is not) could not be registered by anyone with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered to the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number and the world wonder, I discovered a page that sent me an e-mail link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties registration to e-mail and phone number and data just didn't disable it as he claims.
So once again, I've told the technical support that they're just lying (either intentionally or they don't know what they're writing) because what they're writing isn't true.
I've documented several screens that the registration problem was before 31.10. so "false" registration simply doesn't affect this.
I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't verify your claim.
And he's shut down communication.
He repeats the same sentence over and over again that registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and so it didn't even happen.
So if I sum up, Tipsport not only didn't erase the data as he claims, but he's still lying when he claims otherwise.
Worse still, it's easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like a mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little in the way and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was transmitted for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and warning of the same error).
There's music in the subway on the Bridge
Prague's transport company launched the project Music in Metro.
The first vestibule, where the repeated instrumental music plays continuously during the metro operation, is Bridge line A on the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Lenka Nová, František Segrada and Ondra Rumla, accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Matěj Benko, brought the lyricist Michal Horáček not only his completely new two-CD Czech calendar to the hall of the Kolín Municipal Social House.
Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage after the opening intro and the acting ethud about the late musician, and he himself came up with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theatre and the whole town was electrocuted.
"Otherwise, in Cologne, they made two kinds of cards that I had a lot of contact with," he recalled.
So did President Zeman's native.
"Maybe we could make a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who had not left the stage and, if he had not spoken, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the clock, about ice hockey but at that time he had no idea how we met on the squares and we chant who is not jumping, there is no Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we're not going to play it for you here today," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this album for him a very suitable sleep during the day, sing at night and accompany him to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little bit of a detachment into the wall of the heart, which immediately started the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmocha's city," said Michal Horáček.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, Roznáznám was performed by František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Hegerová was reminded of the composition Dad liked Lída Baarová and Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminiscent of Sebastian, then Segrado sang the beautiful composition Prague, musical by Jarda Svoboda, Zasmukým native and former Kolínák.
But that was the conclusion, standing ovation and addition in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
One more encore was prepared for the playlist, but the fans didn't applaud it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four seats behind the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar but also the older CDs, Michal Horáček sat down her books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with potential candidates took a picture.
Berdycha with Stepanek will complete Rosol and Hájek
Jaroslav Navrátil Quadrant Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek nominated for the Davis Cup final against Serbia.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they are going to play on the field of opponents to the Belgrade arena where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15th to 17th November.
The Czechs have been in the finals for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to hot ground, we know it's gonna be wild, and we need to focus, as always, on our performances."
"We will go there with one goal - to gain three points and sell the best," Štěpánek said, the creator of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
U.S. commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis showed exactly what the bombing of Syria would look like.
Without any unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent out planes, they hit the target and came back.
Without being lulled by the official disposal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They're refusing to confirm the whole operation, and they're not talking about it anymore.
The exact opposite of confused and large-mouthed, actions unsupported by Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the entire attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be fooled by the media by their claims that the "Syrian base" or "supply for Hezbollah" was bombed.
I recently wrote here that while US aid to secular insurgents in the country remains only on the rhetorical plane, Russia continues to happily supply Syria's weapons.
And just a fresh shipment of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakija became the target of an Israeli air raid.
A clear message.
And notice, Israel once again bombed Assad's regime, not insurgents, although it should be the other way around according to popular internet theories.
The U.S. government has honored two members of the spatial forces, probably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they were distinguished during the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city is known to me as members of the CIA's secret commando, which is made up of former soldiers.
It's been speculating for a long time what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in a CIA residence elsewhere.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has in Libya its offices protected by machine-gun nests (just on one such two SEALs killed after mortar intervention) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two heroes we've never heard before.
They were part of an American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report of the Benghazi attack, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
Obama's administration is blaming the fact that during the attack, the commando was not officially deployed and the whole and that it simply hesitated to do something.
The commando commander seems to release these volunteers without orders.
Anyway, the fact that he's not a one-timer in the country, but permanent U.S. commandos, CIA agents, and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, nothing like this has been officially admitted, and even now, it's just some sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the US, although half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although it would require much greater help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It wasn't so long ago that the media almost sang Iran's air force for prosecuting American drones.
Little is known, however, how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if an Iranian drone is discovered in an international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that Iran's F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in an international space above the sea, when perhaps the first sharp deployment of America's super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He succumbed to Phantom to optically verify his armor without Phantom registering it on radar or just noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without murmuring.
No wonder Phantom is an American aircraft that remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team hasn't been successful recently in the results, the defender or backupman Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral takes the form that brought him back to the team after a year.
He's doing well in shooting, he's doing well in activity, and after the procedure, he's been ordered a fine kick in the game in Teplice.
Viktoria reached in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but eventually she took one point out of these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in a match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a hard match with North Bohemia, who play attack football.
Everything goes to a match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," attracts the Czech representative of fans at the Doosan Arena stands.
Climb the last fights didn't work out the way she wanted, but the word of the crisis is rejected by defenseman Victoria.
That's how football works, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes worse.
But there's no way I'd talk about a crisis.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," he means Westerners.
Victoria's team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's Friday night and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them by winning," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pete: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, it's a big leap - a jump a few years back, and it's into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "obligations" were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running from school, throwing the bag in the corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump shots.
Then during the series Helena and her boys embroidered with a chain stitch a festive tablecloth for grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings to finally wash the dishes, vacuum them, in winter to carry wood into tiled stones and tasks to do after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of the tasks to write lovely verses addressed to school love).
In the morning breakfast homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the contents of which didn't even lie next to strawberries) and drink it with the tea from the dried herbs that my mom and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when the grave was quiet in the room when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that were spinning loudly in the old tape recorder after my mom.
And then in pencil, we rewinded the tapes and played the same song over and over again, our favorite one, and toasted it with a siphon.
Or maybe we were on the phone over the table using cans that were tied together by a string - and while we were on the phone to better hear each other, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the earring was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents managed to live off it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothes were inherited from generation to generation, and the best "grid" in the wardrobe was a battic t-shirt of homemade production using SAVA.
From electronics, we were satisfied with the said mother's tape recorder and Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used on the train on the school trip, by the way.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry or as I have already said "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure my parents spent a long time saving up for him, but unfortunately he didn't warm up for long.
My younger sister put strudel in it, said he was so beautifully eating the tapes, so she tried to see if she was sleeping the strudel.
Unfortunately, he was asleep, but it was his last bite.
Well, he still has this story, poor thing, on his plate from my dad all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put strudel into the video and thought she was gonna play the recipe and not play it, which is why she still can't cook it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate, make a deal without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I arranged to meet our neighbor's granddaughter next summer at Grandma's on holiday - and that was it, that was it.
We met.
Promise now that you'll see each other in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we ran outside with the whole village, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill by the church on sacks stuffed with hay.
After that, my family and I had dinner and talked about the last day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear the notorious sentence before each dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have any soap attached to the tap in your lemon net in your bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad worked in the garage at a beer with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, leaned on a tiled stove, opened the door and looked at the flames and listened to the crackling of wood that fell from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages every day via different chats, text messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I complement these memories by looking at albums where they're neatly glued to black corners caused by black and white photos.
And in case I didn't know how old I was back then, the photos are always written from behind for a year of taking a picture.
I can see that although the haircuts weren't very good for us by the pot, and we had two bigger pants from our cousin, no one used to laugh at us, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better get back to that step forward - into reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting for modern times to come up with, like, one day for my kids.
What I do know for sure is that these memories of me are at least "one hundred years behind the monkeys" for the young teens now, and I think they're missing a lot that they won't be able to experience this "premonition" period either.
I wish they could!
Google, Samsung and Huawei have been sued for Nortel patents
On Thursday, a group that owns thousands of patents that were lost to Nortel filed a patent infringement suit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that was re-licensed by Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
The US District Court in Texas sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to combine terms searched on the Internet with relevant advertising, the plaintiff states, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that work on Google Android's operating system, which competes heavily with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting price offer of USD 900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel patents, Google won Motorola Mobility for USD 12,5 billion, which was partly motivated by a group of Motorola patents.
"Despite the failure to obtain patents in the auction, Google has violated patents and continues to violate them," he says in the application.
Rockstar seeks increased damages from Google because, according to it, there is a patent breach by Google on purpose, as the action claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came from the outside, from the 4 degrees Celsius we're not used to yet.
First, she put off her smile, the one that kept showing off as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
She was relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was only honest at home on her grandmother's day and her grandchildren Elinka or Adíka were around.
And, of course, when her sons were on the phone.
She remembers very well the instruction from endless business skills classes.
Now they're finally really handy.
So she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a costume suit.
November, even another month can't do that miracle to make her smile, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt places the first President-elect in office
Muhammad Morsi took an inaugural oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end political unrest in Egypt.
ISSLAMISTA Muhammad Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was ceremonially appointed as the first freely elected president of this country, after Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months earlier.
In his commission before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges dressed in black robes in a mansion built with a view of the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are seeking better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on national television.
"Egyptian people today have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11:00 local time in a small motorcade of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the courthouse to celebrate the President, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the motorcade could usually take a busy road connecting the city centre to the suburbs of the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, ridiculously referred to as the noncharismatic "reserved tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists but also as all those who want to lead to the end of the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said, dressed in a blue social suit with red tie judges in a wooden-laid chamber where he took an oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to give an inaugural speech.
While standing on guard, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
The army commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by a chant of "army and the people are one hand" from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where a revolution was born, which ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly promised that he would again seize the presidential powers of his office by a military council that took them over from the expelled leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court rather than before Parliament, as it is customary, he submitted to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
They'll probably have police specialists in the ghettos to relieve the tension.
Police specialists should work in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their walks here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from slums and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior is counting on this.
According to him, "accelerated provision of social housing" would mainly help to improve the situation in the country.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 slum houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mainly Romani people.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families depended on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
Weird thing happened.
According to experts at troubled locations, there was a hundred more in the meantime.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are escalating.
There were anti-Romani marches in several places.
People from the surrounding area also joined extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
It is said that "the consistent application of equal access to law enforcement' is a fundamental condition.
But it is said that this cannot be achieved without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would run errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he'd keep an eye on order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a number of infringements," the Home Office said.
Ghetto specialists would receive additional fees, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into troubled areas should be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (about CZK 15.5 million now).
The Czech Republic pays 15% of the sum, funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors reported.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis to determine where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to make available each year after the project is completed.
According to the project design, selected police officers will first take an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozens of members should go through this training each year.
They'll be the most suitable candidates.
Special training should also be provided for police officers who will work in the ghettos.
According to authors, social housing would mainly help improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea of the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precise rules such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social apartments that would be comparable to ordinary housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan that social workers would have drawn up with them.
They would have to follow the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send children to schools, requalify and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would advance to a higher standard of housing.
The system of spaced housing should function for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation grows "in an integrated environment."
The social housing model is being prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They're supposed to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Carbon Hill - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The coal hill is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others is evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník in a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were here at the beginning of the quarter.
At the top of the Uhlířský Hill is a striking white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Auxiliary, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the completion of the church, the alley was dropped from four rows of lip, about 1 km long.
The cross road on Uhlířské vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second one, from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
There are wooden sculptures on 15 stops made by local art carver František Nedovel.
He used various species of trees from the Low Jeseník area.
Similarly, the rock bases from the area form an interesting geological expression.
Every stop will include the name of the sponsor.
The coal hill is the rest of a young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric age measurements differ somewhat, the last eruption was here about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (age 3.3 million years) and older than the Venus volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
In the process, it expelled a significant amount of volcanic ash, along with fragments of rock from the ground, which, by burning, became reddish-brown.
At the end of this phase, the lava spilled to the surface - today it is a layer of porey basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption threw out red, brown-red and black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tuffets are striking volcanic bombs of up to 1 m. The second eruption was ended by a lava outpouring.
At the end of the activity of the volcano, the lava, which now forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of slag basalt, has flowed.
Volcanoes where volcanic ash discharges are replaced by volcanic ash discharges are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they got the name of stratovulcans.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subjected to erosion.
But he was threatened by rock mining in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.
Tufs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under pressure from experts and the public, the mining was able to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem, however, is in porosity and small rock cohesion, which quickly cools down, crumbles down the slopes.
The quarry is disappearing quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The repair is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a distinctive geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach Uhlířský vrch after the green tourist sign from Bruntál or from Silesian Kočov.
Automobilists can use an unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the lip alley, where even a short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the building.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of Prague's most beautiful villas in Ořechovka.
The original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move away with a small severance package.
So Ivana quickly searched for a replacement place for herself and her older mother back then.
She received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the fourth-floor view of the extensive park and the dam excited me on the other hand," Ivana recalls the first impression.
At first, I thought it'd be a provisional for, like, three years.
"We have been living here for more than 13 years today and I would not change because of a gradual reconstruction," the owner adds.
At that time, Mother and Daughter moved from a 100 - foot - wide apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and gave away almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangement lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in pretty good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting doors or changing windows.
The previous owner tore down the core, but the owner was most annoyed by an impractically designed and unnecessarily large hallway, and vice versa a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used a drywall room to delineate the zones and to reposition the lights.
The first intervention she decided to take after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room got on air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to the partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn't know what to do with the bathroom.
For years, I've been taking home magazines and looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
On the recommendation, I contacted young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," claims Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom it was also possible to modify the available hallway.
The architect connected the toilet and bathroom space and replaced two doors with opening wings with one sliding, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also wheelchair accessible enough.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, a bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued.
As part of the How to Build the Dream program, there was a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room, which was also attended by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping in the space that was created by combining two smaller rooms without helping ourselves with the classical principles of optical division, such as semi- beds or Japanese walls.
"This would ultimately violate the openness and unity of the space," the architect explains.
The sleeping and living part were originally separated.
All you had to do was turn your back on two couches and put a custom-made duvet box between them.
The dining area defines the shades of floor and rinsing.
On the kitchen floor and dining area, the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived the wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette covers sliding panels with wallpaper if necessary.
The new floor of antiallergy marmolea has many advantages compared to the previous laminate: a softer, slippery surface without a clutch and better sound insulation.
The system of recesses and ceilings from the plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how the panel can work with space.
I left the colors on the architects, wishing it would be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The panel of graphoscla with the motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To a warm, energetic tone, architects chose white, which underlined modern functional style.
In a small apartment we managed to save books, among other things, into the space under the windowsill.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the redesigned interior, there is excellent contrast with the new elder, for example with decades old crystal chandeliers and quality art objects that Ivana collects her whole life.
The kitchen came last.
The boxes used to be placed on both sides, and the owner felt a little bit like a tunnel.
The Architect reduced their numbers and repositioned.
Furniture in simple design is custom made, white area softens slightly pearl surface.
The machine, dryer and dishwasher could fit into a small space thanks to an imaginative solution.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the entire glass wall tile above the working plate.
The unique graphoglass with digital print motif is attractive, and it is maintained perfectly.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of tile.
The big shower has a glass door, Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We united the interior in material and colour and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
"Another condition for the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of objects of daily needs," adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has ruled: There is time to prosecute.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas could also be prosecuted for any crimes he might have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former members of the ODS, Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šnajdr and Petr Tluchora, he decided that they could not be punished for any crimes until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, said the spokesperson of the Supreme Court, Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the Court rejected the proposal of the prosecutor, Iva Ištvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative positions in state firms for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in the adoption of laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to prosecute the former Prime Minister who offered them these positions.
He and Vítěm Barta were also arrested by an anti-corruption officer.
Bart's defense attorney, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV members, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client also in this matter, but I cannot comment on this further because of the protection of classified information."
According to information, the case is solved by the General Inspections of the Security Corps (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Bart could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnízpravy.cz, the case could be related to the case of former police President Petr Lessy, whose appointment as Bart was allegedly sought.
Last information The rights show, however, that the arrest of Vít Barta with Petr Lessy is unrelated.
Police spokesperson Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the fact that the case was dealt with by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with a view to protecting classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, said on Friday.
The plaintiff is in charge of Bart's case, and so her words indirectly indicate that the case or criminal proceedings are under cover.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their residence in Prague's Klárov.
She was just loading her bags in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Úsvit Tomio Okamura movement commented on Bart's detention.
In his own words, he has no idea what this case is about.
"Vít Barta was one of many candidates for many parties on our list, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement Tomio Okamura in the past early elections to the House in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption cause of bribery by Members of the Public Things.
In April 2012, he was illegally sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
After that, the sentence was changed, and Bart was acquitted.
I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospala was always the family first, which is why she wants to submit fully to her at 38 years of age.
Either he gets an overseas job and he's gonna extend his career, or he's definitely done with hockey.
"I want to do the role of daddy and husband."
"I look forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting for an offer in vain.
Despite the fact that he's a well-known worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player in the past season.
"But the desire to show them all is still in me," he says with determination.
Maybe he'll come, reportedly wanted by the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and have two more injuries - Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan's assailants.
What does it look like by coming to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that should sign me, but that's all.
Nowhere was it delivered that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
You haven't heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place every day.
That's where the deal really comes in.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it and the team doesn't work.
There's a lot of different factors that need to come together to get that contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York City, aren't there?
Rick Nash is hurt with Ryan Callahan, and the team didn't make it to the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
You're leaving for America on Friday, expecting something to work out?
I've had those expectations since July 5th, when the free-player market opened up in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what all depends on.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna do the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
As early as Sunday, Vasek has two hockey games, it's a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go support our kids in what they want to do.
Are you thinking that you could do this in full-time quotes?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
One day it gets to such a stage that all goals, wins, and passes don't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
You can have any job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have happened to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Because I'm a hockey player, I'm the first person - except my family - to have a sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, I mean, sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we'd love to see them continue this trend.
Because what we're gonna tell ourselves is that there are possibilities in America somewhere else.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So you plan to stay in America permanently?
We're gonna practice this like we're gonna do now.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia on Hluboká and in the surroundings of České Budějovice.
And in the winter, back in Tampa or wherever our steps take us.
It's perfect to be warm all the time.
I've been so lucky in my life.
You could say I went to meet him, it cost him a lot of strength and a lot of recitation, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to do this so they can choose what they're gonna do and how they're gonna live.
How long will you work hard, train hard, and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you're still on the NHL, that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
You can't plan that.
So you could say you're gonna wait this season to see how it turns out and then decide what to do next?
I'm in a phase where I go day by day.
CEZ CEO recently announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th block of the Temelín power plant was postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified it by waiting for a new state energy concept and agreeing contracts of diversity by the government.
These are the reasons why CEZ's current leadership is trying to delegate its responsibility to the government - the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should make recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.
I'm only ruling with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is starting to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn political craft in opposition and that it will have to go directly to the government to create one at all.
Chairman ANO admitted it in an interview for the Law, which will come out tomorrow.
Business and marketing ŠkoFINu is led by Abrahamek
Its competence includes product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Luděk Šantor in his post.
Abrahamek has joined the automotive sector for the last 14 years of his professional career.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the brand and dealers of Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last assignment was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was founded in 1992.
The police evacuated the L.A. Airport for shooting.
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly being terminal three.
Reuters, referring to California's media, claims that the lawmen shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, reported a gunfight involving two or three members of the Transportation Safety Administration.
How many people were quite injured and whether there are any victims but still is not clear.
Fire department's talking about an event with more injuries.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israel's military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakiya on Thursday.
With reference to an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN announced it.
Israel's press reported the explosion in an alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
When asked by CNN, the Israeli army spokesperson refused to comment on the air raid.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
According to the U.S. government source, the target of the Israeli air raid was rockets and related equipment that, in the Israeli opinion, could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
In response to another U.S. security officer, AP reported that Russian SA-125 missiles were the target of an Israeli air raid on Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of attack but according to the agency DPA showed a battery of Russian missiles type S-125 Neva.
In addition, the SA-3 rocket battery, including a radar command center, was reported to be visible on them to track the missiles and their targets.
According to the report, recorded rockets have a range of 35 km [35 km] and could carry a 70 - kg [70 kg] warhead.
Israel has bombed the supply of missiles inside Syria at least twice this year, reported CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to intervene in any supply of weapons intended for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to successfully resist this trend.
The company updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The Agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to be between USD 325 million and USD 340 million compared to USD 305 to 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current development is maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase compared to the record profit of USD 290.4 million from 2011/12.
General Manager Graham Turner said that Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year, and the second half began with sharp growth mainly in Australian and British travel outside business trips.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are moving towards a record annual profit before interest and tax," he said.
This is where Australia and Great Britain belong, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Recreational activities took place in Australia during the second half of the year, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
America's trade has recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to generate a third year's profit in a row.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia were transported to St Petersburg
Ecological activists detained since September in Russia because of a protest against planned oil extraction in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St Petersburg.
Today, AFP informed about this with an appeal to Greenpeace's international environmental organisation.
At the same time, she claims that the original accusations of her piracy activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after non-violent action against the Arctic oil platform were transported from Murmansk Correctional Facility to St Petersburg Prison," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, this was a planned transfer.
The authorities first accused ecologists of piracy, for which they were threatened with up to 15 years in prison in the event of a conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace this charge with a milder riot, for which there is a lower sentence, with a maximum of seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace pointed out in today's statement that the charges for piracy have not yet been dropped, as promised.
I understand that means that the arrests are now being charged with two crimes.
The Mighty Investigation Committee announced last week that the charges of piracy would be replaced by charges of disorderly conduct.
But when 30 prisoners went before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, new accusations have been made against everyone," AFP quoted from Greenpeace's statement.
The Russians detained three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries at Gazprom oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against whom they have filed appeals, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists are complaining about the conditions of imprisonment.
According to AFP, the Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo said that moving to St Petersburg would make it easier to meet families and consular staff.
But there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he pointed out.
The Dutch King Willem-Alexandra was asked for help by one of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists.
In a written letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch was invited to discuss their situation in a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Maliki has a major share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the work of fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare game, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied during English Literature classes.
The test will also include "hidden text" to motivate deeper reading;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a graduation exam from the language and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other major subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees graduation exams, reveals changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society" and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation exam be "more demanding, ambitious and stricter."
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
In comparison, schools in Australia spend about 143 hours a year on average and around 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition resources have indicated that a comprehensive math exam - along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the results charts - will probably encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on "the problems of the real world," including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, the long-smoldering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD went on fire.
Everything came to an end when Mayor Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned to the court for an undemocratic nomination.
However, the case makers did not want to comment too much so that they would not harm the party even more before the elections.
But the votes of the electorate are now numbered.
The management of Ostrava's ČSSD called on Mayor Ostrava to step up from the party on Monday night and will probably also push to lose his post.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What is involved in disputes and who is on whose side is described in an exclusive interview for Diary.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The ČSSD certainly counted on a much better result.
Was it damaged by the fact that there were disputes within the party before the elections?
I imagine social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand, it's consistent with the state in which ČSSD is now in.
It's a side that has internal problems, it's internally ill, and people feel it's not all right in it.
They made it very clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
I think that the ODS has been going through a decline for some time now, and unfortunately, such things are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, have moved on to the people in the ČSSD and influence them.
It has to do with the fact that police go around the offices of the Ostrava City Hall and collect computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not just made up of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two unconciliable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haškovec and Sobotkovec.
But it's been getting ready for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a sign of what is happening now in Prague.
Hashkov's wing gradually occupied its position so that after the election it could trigger a situation that weakens Sobotkov's wing.
One is in a political situation where sometimes one has to compromise.
But everyone has some kind of internal line where the compromises can't be made anymore, and so is my case.
I originally didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralek that I would try to get on the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotka's wing as Mayor of Ostrava.
Hashko's wing didn't stop it.
Why are you taking sides with Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michael Haska?
I think Sobotka is a person who always talks mainly about the ČSSD programme and to some extent about visions for the party and for this country.
I admit I didn't hear anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can begin to call off the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, by what Michal Hašek has now shown in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How you perceived that the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you for the candidate.
Political parties are based on the competition to be placed as members.
The competition should mostly be based on program visions and the ability of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have powers or visions are also entering this competition, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people begin to come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruples, they break the party's statutes.
By their practices, they make the Mafia political parties, and I think they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether there is a political future for Kainnar.
It is important for the parties to start respecting the statutes.
So before the election, you filed a motion for a preliminary action against the form of a candidate for the ČSSD in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current District Executive Committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava strengthens its power by being able to abolish, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually throwing out uncomfortable party members.
One example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed an action against it and then they annulled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the statutes of the party through the courts is the last option, but at the moment that the other methods and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The aim of the leadership of Ostrava's ČSSD led by Mr Adam Rykala is to remove you from your position as mayor.
It is a public secret that Mayor Poruba Lumír Palyza has an appetite for this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they strengthen their power in the party for the votes.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around Baník Ostrava's football club and buying the Bazala Stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could call me a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
Meanwhile, the city bought property that is strategically of great value to it.
So how do you feel about your staying in the mayor's office?
The District Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like when a thief screams, "Get the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last 11 years, I don't see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of science and technology parks.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than that I'm interfering with others to get to the places they desire.
Are you going to fight these efforts in any way?
Because if this republic is going to work well, then political parties must work well.
I find it hard to believe that any side will be able to manage the state effectively if it can't even drive itself.
So I'm not thinking of leaving the ČSSD now because I think that whoever's causing this party's cancer isn't me, but these people are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc will open a public ice rink in the historical centre
The organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spálený said that the preparatory work on the rink was started on 26 October and since Wednesday the ice production aggregate is in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the surface will be ready for the first visitors.
The mooring has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Ice skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stalls available.
"We have expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stalls, and almost the entire surface of the podium is covered so that skaters can comfortably change," Sporný described.
The streets of Olomouc already resemble the coming Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed in front of the main entrance of the town hall on Horní náměstí due to repairs of the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of City Hall in 2009, when the rink was operational from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched in Upper Square one month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín region will be re-solved by the Regional Court
The Regional Court acquitted 25-year-old Slovak and 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the guilt.
They're facing 15 to 20 years in prison or an extraordinary sentence.
Speaker Petr Angyalossi confirmed that the Supreme Court annulled the Regional Decision and returned the matter to him for discussion.
The judge refused to comment on the grounds that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, the young men were ambushed by a 70-year-old man in his house.
Senior died an agonizing death.
According to the prosecution, the men strangled him, beaten him, and dug him all over the body, and also a metal object, apparently a gas gun, placed about three dozen blows in the head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures of the cranial bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding into the brain that he succumbed to at the site.
The youngsters reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only, in addition, indirect evidence against the defendants' scent marks, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Scent marks from the crime scene and other cases were consistent with the defendants in more than ten cases, but the police initially treated them as material and not scent marks.
In addition, certain errors in handling them have been identified.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proven without any doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he probably fell and injured himself.
There was no mention of violent deaths by a paramedic called in to the rescue services.
CSIs contacted Olomouc doctors only a few days later, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the evidence from the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
There was no DNA on the scene of the defendants.
Young Slovak lived in Hungary.
Now he's serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was finally confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who were responsible for the robbery of goldsmiths.
Robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopný.
Younger of the accused of the murder of a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who would reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week's Autumn Strings
The saxophone giant and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will dot next Wednesday for the 18th year of the Struna Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Great Hall of Lucerna together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia will be added to Shorter under Martin Kumžák's leadership.
In Shorter's edits for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Autumn Strings will launch his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
The list of performers he worked with dates from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitous and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade they gave the direction of a new fusion style.
He's been performing with Wayne Shorter Quartet in particular for the past 13 years.
After the festival there will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on 9 November at Roxy/NoD.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the local audience will be introduced to the Manchester Trio Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent, Ian Mikyska, who will bring Profound Bass electro-jazz formation inspired by dance styles.
They say the Damks forbid UEFA to publish sentences for referees.
Dagmar Damková, Chairman of the Panel of the Arbitration Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It's forbidden by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview for the law diary.
Otherwise, the FACR would be threatened with sanctions.
Damková also refused to be a party to the footballers of Pilsen, where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but other members of the committee are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of a vote, I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to a criticism that raged after Pilsen recently played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
So, although in recent months the FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for referees, Damková assures us that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me that if the committee finds out that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit the delegation to it, whatever the match is," Damková said.
According to Damková, the reason why the penalties are not published is a ban on European football Union.
"The UEFA forbids the disclosure of such information and punishes the infringement harshly."
"We're very suspicious here and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have made restrictions public, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be severe sanctions," Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We really were the exception," she said.
If the disclosure continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And those are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not have fulfilled the program to educate judges," Damková added.
The arrest of Bárta is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is it behind the leak of wiretaps?
Police arrested the President of Public Vitus Bart on Thursday.
Jan Petržílek, head of the Department of Analyst and Informatics against Corruption Police, was also arrested with him.
The arrest is linked to the wiretap of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The news server Novinky.cz confirmed a reliable source to the Czech Press Office.
Listening to phone calls by Janoušek and Béma, published last March by Mladá fronta Today, in which both men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík," show Janoušek's influence on the city's steps under Bém's direction.
The diary then stated that it was acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which two years later they escaped to the security agency ABL.
That's what Bart owned back then.
News server Novinky.cz pointed out that the arrested criminalist Petržílek worked for the BIS right before he joined the anti-corruption police.
Petrílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently wired, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can neither confirm nor say anything at all," said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case doesn't want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code.
Six companies out of ten are intensively preparing for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act as of 1 January 2014.
Only 8 percent of the company's representatives surveyed said that they did not deal with matters related to both key codes in their company.
This results from a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching deadline for the effectiveness of both key codes, a number of managers are only now beginning to realize at the last minute what a significant impact they can have on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will in our opinion affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has long been uncertain as to whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually take place because of politicians' laurels.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to move to the new law for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of the companies intensively engaged in new laws, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to prepare them in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of the companies in this number are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, each fifth firm has not yet dealt with recodifications, yet has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent has no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that they have not yet dealt with matters related to recodifications.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent) for the largest number of companies interviewed, followed by the solution of business conditions (16 per cent) and changes in the Land Register and liability for damage (for ten per cent).
The treaties will take place one of the most important innovations of the entire recodification, namely the unification of the amendment of contracts only within the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will cease, as a result of which the contract law should become clearer for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with emphasis on greater freedom of arrangement of relations," said attorney Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddán.
In connection with the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies as the most important issue.
They also follow topics related to changes in the assembly and the general meeting (15 per cent) and representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and potential impacts for statutory bodies, especially in situations where companies are in danger of bankruptcy or if they enter it.
"In practice, this means that if the board members and directors of the companies do not deal with the care of a proper economic operator and do not reverse the imminent bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefits gained for the performance of the duties only in the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier style evolve like a living language

Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwell and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 leading candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes.
In the competition for CNN Heroes of 2013 you can vote for him or any other of the ten main candidates.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle watched his father go unconscious again and again and again and went to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital city of Cameroon Yaonde.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he created a hematoma that caused problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwell spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to get there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants is in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwell.
They can't enjoy life with poverty.
When Bwell saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at Yaonde Central Hospital.
And he founded a nonprofit ASCOVIME organization, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into supplies, attach medical supplies to rooftops, and travel rough terrain to villages that need help.
Happiness doesn't always accompany them.
More than once, vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with its wide smile and unbridled energy - is very willing to engage in local cheer.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every expedition," says Bwell.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or gift glasses or a birth certificate for free - a document that requires a school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing simple surgeries under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in the school building, in the town hall or at home; after surgery the patient gets up and goes to a recovery site to make room for the next patient.
Using light from the generator, operating room and sanitary equipment Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay awake and continue to work, they play drums all night," says Bwell.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group - consisting of cameramen's doctors and foreign medical students - performed 700 free operations last year and realized that their help could mean a lot to local residents.
One man said that after hernia surgery, he would be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organising these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaonde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his nonprofit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteered for Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We thoroughly washed Bwell's hands and removed blood stains or held tools for him," says O'Malley.
You'll never experience that as a second-year medical student in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their own way to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But once they arrive in Yaonde, the food, transportation and study is provided by Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, a constant struggle is not a burden.
Helping others live happier, fulfilling his father's promise is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," says Bwell.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain - that's why I do it.
Take a look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát renewed the position of Head Nurses for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised so that nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses, and I think that the field of nursing deserves proper attention from the Ministry as well.
In carrying out this profession, it takes not only high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and a personal conviction.
"I would like and with all responsibility to try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and handy nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who are not helping us with their approach to patients to perform their calling with all empathy and help us improve the image of our sisters in the public eye," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also said that she wants to deal with various aspects of the position of a nurse and, among other things, she intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educational professionals, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I do not want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary I see them standing next to each other, each with their respective competences and together with other health professionals they form a team of workers who provide health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the exercise of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of the nurse are unnecessarily burdening them and are wasting time that they might and should rather devote to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas that he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with the team and with management of health service providers, adjusting competences and also employment issues, such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading nurses with their insufficient number in the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, which, however, are not documented on a specific case where there could be a violation of the rules because of fear of possible sanctions.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the position of the Head Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee to maintain anonymity of such a complaint and to have the competent authorities examine the specific case," Šmídová concludes.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (absolved in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study programme Sickery - pedagogy (absolved in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been Head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-Medical Fields and Recognition of Qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bedside of the internal department, further worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the main sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several expert books on nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
♪ So I don't stop hating ♪
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, he lived, but did not write, he published a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presentness.
That it is not a small volume suggests the number of pages comparable to its most famous piece of Houstov (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahuda confessed another significant Czech contemporary writer - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so I wouldn't stop hating.
To see the new and new clones of the human foolish petty, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavors.
I'm not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless covetousness, veslácké soul and reverse-polared idealists, who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a little sales bitch.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my Jurodite friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I can feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I like to go for walks and read books at the lamppost tonight.
You're talking about feeling wasted, hating.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
A break came a long time ago, about ten years old.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, I lived after that.
But there's still a surprised quiet boy in there.
I see other lonely practicers, everyone in their tornado anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm taking part in this giant, thousands of years of movement of the life system on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when the path of experiment-mistake arises another generation of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self - speaking, or rather, a dialogue that is conducted by the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
As the period of peace is intersected by silently sleeping metastases of wars, which may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I could feel the avalanche of my life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, one day I'd be quietly swamped.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and placed by layers that are stored in the darkness "under the level of consciousness."
The neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient year circles of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his sight to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heaven above me.
Eventually, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself on ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical ties all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to constantly changing presence, in a constant attempt to name and understand its surroundings and decrypt important messages.
Sometimes there's an overload disorder.
Analogically - as if you dropped your PC, from a program of speech emulator and translator from foreign languages, you would get involved first in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarts ended up in a dark green flashing Bios screen, in a basic system that controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention her often - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the wake of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there will be a breakthrough.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "For so long he looked into the abyss, until the abyss looked into it. "
A pure feeling - that one is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "death " and new quality comes in.
And why do I care personally?
I'll answer with an illustration.
Once one fell into a pool and was drowning, running days, months and years, he kept drowning and reading, and the books taught him to swim - to live.
He became a diver.
Perhaps some of my written sentences will help someone, as Hrabal's lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
The one about whom nothing meaningful can be said, they call it consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the formulation process of words and sentences."
From early youth he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine Captain Nemo, ran around the Shadows in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all this branching of authors and their message, it is "the sun of the bright worlds of other Karel Hynek Mácha."
And when the book's out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
The retro-retro reflection that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take 300 crowns and are willing to read 500 pages of the text.
And then, for example, after years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult life decision.
In fact, books are "lives " or" worlds " better said.
They are encoded in letters, they bear experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can always wake them up to life if we let their sentences flow to the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to ancient demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After publishing the book you - as it often does - await a chain of authorial readings.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you gonna be happy to do this again, or do you feel differently after years?
Today, I prefer to just talk.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are inconspicuous, they don't draw attention to themselves, they have friendly radiation, you don't feel lonely with them.
Let me give you an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope there is still alive) one curly bookseller (name is conveniently Červenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl bull.
During one drink, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houstina.
I looked into their eyes and then I was shown a broken, numbered specimen of my book.
As I was embarrassed, I laid off the just-read morgue and wept briefly in a man's eyes.
We all stood there quietly, wobbling and wept drunkards.
Then the young blonde half-breed couldn't stand it and jumped over his head from the window into the snow drift.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night landscape and hunted down the happy rabies sensitive, the painful soul of the countrymen and the pains of the fallen patriots - they poured out and cuddled like werewolves till morning.
Each of your books is both formal and content-different to the previous ones.
Is this also true of the text Wind, dark, present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts the words of an old Russian myth into the mouth of a folks' healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog, there's a gray chest on it.
Horrible, horrible, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we were devils in hell a long time ago and drew lots - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free tide of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnamed, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and so wide that it completely transcends our horizon - and so we are doing precisely in the intensity of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with dopamine influx, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a glitch and we glow compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the ocean's coast of unconsciousness, and in a leaky sail made of a dirty handkerchief, it catches the tides of the warm wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama Retreats from Health Care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama withdrew yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
With a reference to hundreds of thousands of statements from providers, Republicans have accused the president of misleading the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama broke his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functional health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called "disruption in the media" about statements, Obama called on the Americans who received these announcements to search for new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who purchased insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on available care.
"I am telling these Americans frankly: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her statement before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Law on available care, said that the launch of the Internet market has been "poorly" since October.
"I'm as disappointed and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
The irritated Sebelius said this sentence, which was picked up by a microphone on, yesterday in the direction of an advisor sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place after a turbulent exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was concerned whether she herself had to participate in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly asked why the "architect" of the Law on available care did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not buy the program via Healthcare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, owner of PPF Group, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes he is already up his sleeve.
The transaction notification should be made in November, probably before the LTE network auction starts, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the name Sazka Telecommunications, it launched a frequency auction for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, the company's tastes of infiltrating telecommunications have not been discussed.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecommunications master Robert Chvaltal.
He started as the marketing chief of Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became director of Slovak T-Mobile and was the last head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she's admitting that she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
It would not normally like Vodafone, but according to Hospodářské noviny information, it may be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If this succeeds in the tender on LTE networks (as a newcomer can auction specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not need to enter the auction at all, or will not mind the auction of a limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share networks with Sazka.
Vodafone lets Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend money on a fixed internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately obtained a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, he's a big moloch waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have won Kellner already for O2 and very probably in co-operation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share networks.
The auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Can Czech Television ever do without signing events?
The legendary scene with an ashtray entered President Zeman's era, so it is not difficult to listen to complaints that gather evidence of the harassing of the castle crew.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was not documented, let alone signed.
That's right, the editors stood up for the board.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a variety of journalists come from - whether it is a reaction to direct orders or not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of uncalled for empathetic helpfulness.
And when we assume general rottenness, we cannot forgive ourselves for the question of whether other, no less unscrutable power interests that have not yet been given an opportunity to change the situation on television.
The truth is those who say that there are no eye-to-face attempts at policy intervention on the air in developed countries.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that public media complaints do not exist there.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize what they consider to be the tenderness that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this situation isn't with us.
But it may also be more comfortable in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about evil politicians and good journalists than the more complicated descriptions of an inconspicuous situation in which many imperfect human beings face themselves.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of strength
It is almost a rule that at the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfil its state's obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency, and the events around Munich would have gone a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could have gone abroad, heavy weapons could have been destroyed, and the government could have fled to London right away and not fought hard for their legitimacy.
And most importantly, the nation wouldn't be hung over from the surrender to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still in shape during Munich, but during the war it started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
If he had been better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
He was elected "the President will not be in a position to make decisions. "
But he had to, although the big decision with the knife on Hitler's neck was probably not in the Chancellor's office.
By the last days of March 1939, the head of intelligence, František Moravec, said what everything should be done to ensure that the occupation he knew for the day was not so smooth and profitable for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, and they didn't believe him either, they were afraid.
The human wreck of Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow commanded him.
Ludwig Svoboda finally made it impossible to normalize and had to demolish him, already completely senile,.
That Husak was helpless and sick depressed old man happening in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only good thing.
Havel was lucky he hasn't been met in office in the last few years, he's been spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, many of his actions seem to suspect that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Now here's what we have.
The head of state and the commander in chief of the armed forces look like they are, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat to the Republic now.
Or maybe it's threatening, but it's just not visible.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not good (from a historical point of view), that the president is not quite at strength.
But it's not normal.
Couldn't we elect the president in this country once again to be someone reasonably thought and acceptablely healthy?
Remote planets, black and white movies, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw casually.
In the concept of his quartet, which will finish this year's Struna Autumn festival in the large hall of Lucerna in Prague on November 6th, everything is related to everything.
The parts of the quartet of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter are the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues have to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
This principle, however, is a newly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, wearer of nine Grammys, former teammate Miles Davis, and probably the biggest living jazz saxophonist today - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I came to the conclusion that it was best to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then they're disappointed when things turn out differently," says Shorter.
As the insects from Thailand raised the sales of the Parisian bar
You may be smirking at insects, yet you have no idea that you will eat it at least half a kilo a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience taken care of.
Elie Daviron, a chef and owner of Le Festin Nu, placed the insect offer first in Paris on the menu of his business at the beginning of October.
A bar for whose name was the inspiration of the book William Burroughs Naked Lunch, you would find in the fashionable 18th district near Montmartre a widely visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, the guests can newly bite not only different larvae, locusts or water beetles, they can also taste scorpions.
Carefully and specially packed deliveries (to avoid damage to the wings, to the legs, or to the eyes) send Daviron all the way from Thailand.
Europe is still learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons to consume insects.
The first is the environmental benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (which concerns finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for Reuters Station.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes the pleasure, the sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would be thrilled by the idea of eating a beetle decorated with pesto, but the reaction of customers of the Parisian bar to a served insect is very positive according to the owner.
They say even skeptics will eventually taste even though they begin with the smallest bites and eventually choose scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings Should Continue
Since 2008 the Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and a lack of interest to the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who save significant amounts of heating after the implementation of the measure, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2700 new jobs to the state.
In terms of fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are important, and they are also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the Government's resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps, which would allow the continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be announced within it.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
The dog summarized the carpet, the president tripped and ended up with crutches
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lany.
What condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted to soften the US's defense stance on his surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented confession, he said that in some cases spying had gone too far.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama are responsible for acting as an "autopilot" in the wake of the annoying revelations about NSA's spy activity, which appeared thanks to Edward Snowden's informant.
Public information has sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video-connection at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government really learned about some of the things that were happening from inertia, because that possibility was, with reference to World War II, a difficult Cold War period and then, of course, 9/11. "
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage crossed the line, but he stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said: "In some cases it has gone too far. "
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to people and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA organization sought good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. "
There is radical extremism in the world, which is firmly committed to murdering and blowing people up and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people being executed because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
On Thursday, the President of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs said that American legislators are going to Europe to respond to the concerns of foreign affairs concerning alleged US espionage and to convince Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other persons this week and that he was worried about their threats to halt participation in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disillusioned by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the US's national security interests, it is really important that Europe stay on the same ship with us, taking into account the joint efforts to combat terrorism, he said in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the Senate Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, regardless of their rage over NSA programs.
News in the media that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe has disrupted relations with some American allies, although the Agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstood metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery quoted documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and other 34 world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper advocated ally spying as necessary and said it was a common matter on both sides.
In the middle of the turmoil, Murphy said that his office was planning a parliamentary journey to take place this year, hoping that members of both sides and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to participate are to be published.
He said there's still work to be done on the program.
Although Murphy said that the aim of the trip was to help fix relationships, he added that "well - meaning educational measures " would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about the espionage programs they have been using themselves for years.
"While we are adapting our surveillance programs to better protect European rights, they too need to realise that we are not the only ones doing espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is on his way this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the hostility that the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran has provoked, as well as American surveillance activities.
Australian woman appealed against a stay in Thai prison
A 21 - year - old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15 - day prison on Phuket Island, falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with perjury on the Phuket island on 15 June when she told the Thai police that a taxi driver and two other men who allegedly detained her attacked her in the morning on Sunday 10 June.
However, the industrial TV footage later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Phuket Island Police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security penitentiary in Phuket instead of being put in adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned " about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult time, but we hope that it will return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail 50,000 baht.
In the meantime, reports from Australia indicate that she spent her vacation in the recreation area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal resources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australia's travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct the damaged image for tourists, which may have been behind the liberating verdict.
The Jag joked: "Goal of the Breathe"?
He got a puck in the defensive zone, and no one caught him.
He changed the leak after a quick forhend loop.
Jaromír Jagr scored this way against Tampa on Wednesday night, on Thursday night then 119. winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After seeing this video, my agent Petr Svoboda was contacted by the director of České dráhy and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" wrote Jágr at the introduction.
I hear we're a lot alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit night training so I don't get any faster.
"I am afraid that the Minister of Defence could then call and want to advertise on jets!" he added.
In addition, New Jersey has added a second win in a row.
"And most importantly, you have noticed - Marie Rottra's treatment is working," Jágr concluded.
Post-election sirloin post-election goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
They are not only parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and eventually ČSSD due to their internal division.
The politicians served us a post-election stew instead of a holiday sirloin this weekend.
The election jumper was the Andrej Babiš movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance so far.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party record the political (from) will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the electorate, who did not vote for the party that President Zeman publicly supported or elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the President lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to get it back - for example, by choosing the future Prime Minister.
While the ČSSD's chances of obtaining a prime minister's seat in my eyes are slipping away, Andrej Babiš's businessmen, on the other hand, are getting closer.
The post-election development is still a mile away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the electoral scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by communists, this development is a better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Given the loud resistance of YES to get together with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant of the coalition of ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (total of 111 Members) is still.
Given the split in ČSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak parter in negotiations, the outcome of coalition negotiations can be quite depressing for ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD composed of "non-zemanos" at the Castle is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government to which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which can lead sooner or later to another division in the party.
So I ask myself, "Aren't we going to have to make some more early elections?"
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the YES movement.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a more pronounced increase in income taxes, and the construction of a state bank, hopefully fell under the table.
On the contrary, ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Dawn agree, for example, to promote business, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote employment of disadvantaged people, lower VAT rates for selected goods.
The friction surfaces are most common in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
YES now has the upper hand, so the program so far most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing tax program on anything that still moves in the economy.
