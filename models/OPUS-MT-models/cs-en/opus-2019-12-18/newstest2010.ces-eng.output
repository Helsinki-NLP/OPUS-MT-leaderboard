Barack Obama gets the Nobel Peace Prize as America's fourth president
American President Barack Obama will fly to Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American President in history.
The diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and he will be busy.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he will meet five members of the committee for the first time, who were selected from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then have a meeting scheduled with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
After this afternoon, the visit will culminate in the festive ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He'll get it as America's fourth president, but only the third to get the prize right in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The President does not want to avoid this because he realizes that he is taking the prize as president who is currently at war in two countries.
War effort increased a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize any of his critics.
During the Obama ceremony, he will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's going to give these for charity purposes, but he hasn't decided on a particular charity yet.
The busy program will then lead the president and his wife to the banquet, where besides the Norwegian king and queen there will also be the prime minister and other 250 invited guests.
Obama was more modest from the start to the price.
For example, he noted that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just for him, but for all who strive for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that he was "a call for action. "
Nature protector charged with extortion
Litoměřická policy accused the President of the Civil Association of the Society of Conservation of Nature Litoměřice of Blackmail.
In several cases last year he referred to some construction proceedings, for withdrawing appeals he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Litoměřická police spokesperson Alena Romová.
Lubomír Studnička is the chairman of the Society of Environmental Protection.
Now he's in custody and is facing up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers Brno doesn't smell very good
In Prague, ordinary people can sort containers from drinks, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
Where you set aside a few minutes before you find a suitable trash can.
I don't want to say that he wouldn't have trash in Brno at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors are not interested in this problem when we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the forest league sorting waste not only because, as citizens, we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics in sorting containers, but mainly the number of bins on such waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a PET bottle into a collection bin downtown?
It's a closet, especially takes time and firm nerves.
The only place I've hit so far is in Moravian Square across from Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think that's enough.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't sort the trash like that.
Out of laziness.
It's a long way from the trash cans.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered myself to throw away some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful trash cans on Kounic Street in sight.
Luckily, on my way to the dressing room, I ran into the right place.
But the trash overflowed from it.
This is still the centre of Brno, which the city most represents, isn't it?!
But I guess ecology and some aesthetics aren't really interested in Brno socialists.
Those cities would rather buy a hockey extra league that would disgrace us all over the country than buy a few more containers and offer to sort other ingredients for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm my assumption after a while of browsing on the Internet with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has added, despite the government's view, to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sick leave or building savings.
But also interest on state debt or international litigation.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for an increase to some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions, or sick leave to borrow additionally. "It's just putting away problems for the future, laying mines," says Janota.
In fact, interest is increasingly paid on borrowed money and has to come back at some point.
There's not a lot of choice where to take it, the state doesn't have it.
If they do not reduce welfare or running costs, they must raise taxes.
Everyone she has just added to the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children.
There is no need for people to fear for pensions or sick leave, whose account has lost 1.8 billion, to get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more indebted - not just 163 billion will be missing in the cash register next year, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Januta, the debt will grow faster and more quickly, along with interest costs.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
To move money for the benefit of several groups of voters, there will also be five billion missing next year for the construction of motorways and railways.
These are mostly already competing and built-up sections, which can be redesigned and possibly not discounted.
To preserve, which isn't free either.
It means a delay or a stop to 30 large buildings, the use of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD suggested that the loss of money will be resolved in Solomon - it will reach into the dividends of ČEZ, which the state mostly owns, and it will add the transport fund to them.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is not a bottomless source at all.
Last year, 18 billion arrived in the budget from ČEZ.
The dividends are paid annually to liquidate environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for planned pension reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5,7 percent of GDP.
However, this does not stop the carnival of movement.
Nearly three billion have fallen in the budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crime or to the costs of litigation, even for building savings.
If the state can do without that money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing from the already launched two-billion-dollar project of the Treasury, which is designed to enable online monitoring of what individual authorities spend on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister didn't find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
Americans expect a mobile phone to switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just press one key and transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware aims at, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We allow you to keep two user profiles on your phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at one and the same time, indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which was also run alongside Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is underway.
VMware now cooperates with European and American operators to test virtualization of smartphones and should reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains plagues hoteliers
The bare slopes aren't just worried about the Krkonoše skiers.
Missing snow discourages people from ordering skiing stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, there are still available rooms in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
There's a lot of visitors on our website.
People are going through offers, they're getting prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they're calling us, they're asking right away if we think Christmas will be on snow or mud," said the operator of Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly as they wish should not hesitate to order.
Whoever prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is second place with him, he can still try to wait a few days.
Meanwhile, Spindleruv hoteliers offer mainly only weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they're gonna try to turn them in for a while, but then they're gonna let go and go for a shorter time.
And then the spare rooms will decline quickly," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter terms are still offered by Vrchlabská travel agency Ingtours.
Now we're most interested in Christmas week, which isn't sold out yet.
Half the seats in our offer remain vacant.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Petr Schiefert, director of Ingtours.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabská travel agency, but there are fewer seats available.
The first 14 days of February are also well disposed of, while the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he's attacking.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year on mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out," Schiefert means.
On the contrary, the rooms of Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou are much better occupied than last year.
We're about five percent better off.
We have the last few places for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in January, and February is also well sold," said Karel Rada, director of the best stone hotel.
Of the eighty percent, the New Year's Eve stays are also occupied by the Omnia hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, half of the beds available at the latest Yanskolpa hotel remain at Christmas.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, which is already occupied by about 60%.
It is a bit weaker so far February, but once snow attacks, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, the director of Hotel Omnia Erik Sporysch said.
However, for a larger share of snow, the Krkonoše hoteliers have to let go of their appetite.
Thursday's supposed to cool off, if there's any collisions, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then the warming should come again, Jiří Jakubský informed from the Hradec Institute of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is ridiculous how Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his longingly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it through a copy of a copy of Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as much as in Iraq" in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to even use the name Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward".
Three years ago, he criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by the civil war as "unresponsible and catastrophic decisions in its consequences. "
However, subsequent months have shown that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of field commanders has been the only possible and successful enough to say nothing about Iraq in the news session today.
It did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
He was asked again by field commanders to increase his military contingent, especially Chief of Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House despite sub-office practices.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but that's the best he could come up with, so at least he cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze out the promise of another 5,000 out of Europe, even though he originally expected at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to begin the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years.
Many doubt that a half - way increase will give the same fruit as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, its leaders honoring the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite sign - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces used to change their master every day according to their convenience.
The political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a temkin village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to exist.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex given the inexplicability of conditions that make Pakistani and Iranian influences even more complicated.
Nor does the construction of an "actionable state," which is the minimalist objective of the entire operation, seem too real.
Obama's strategy's time horizon is staggering with its voluntaristism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the brink of an explosion.
Believe in the fact that soldiers sent to the war tempest for the "early return home" cause a miracle here, only the soul can truly romantic, untouched reality.
Politically, the determination of the withdrawal date is pure irresponsible, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is coming to a loss.
European politicians cannot or do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of Hindukus.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions will not affect Iranians, there will be a difficult question before the United States whether it will try to solve the problem by military force.
It will be necessary to respond to it at the very time when Obama says America will proceed to a winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only Band-Aid for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore enough time left to come up with another strategy if this one turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash rewards
The senior executives of the U.S. Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that responded to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive shares instead of money that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, the shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus leading the Wall Street reward line with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, mentioned former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting almost $17 billion aside in the first three quarters of this year (almost CZK 300 billion) for rewards.
According to Reuters, the total amount of remuneration in the company for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measures announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries as the financial crisis comes.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to burden bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000 (about CZK 712,000) one-time tax of 50%.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The five women in Stockholm today received the Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature from King Carl XVI of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müllerová was among them.
Two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
This award was taken today by scientists Charles Kao for research on fiber optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each awarded received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a financial reward certificate.
For each category, it amounts to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately CZK 25 million).
If the decorated in each of them is more, the reward is divided between them.
Traditionally, US President Barack Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, for he is only at the beginning of his career, and he is at the head of a country that is leading two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defending his policy, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to win peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering a resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle.
President Václav Klaus will accept on Friday morning Minister of Finance Eduardo Janota, who is considering remaining in the government because he does not agree with the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's remaining in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President's spokesperson Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota wants to discuss her remaining in office on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, however, the House approved the Left's proposals for money transfers and increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals for social democracy for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left hand on one and the government, Klaus and the right hand on the other, there was a sharp internal political dispute, which led to the beginning of a question mark on the next action of Fischer's cabinet, on whose formation the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
The critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially destroying the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government pushed through in the fall and is supposed to stop the debt of the state.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the State Budget Act, stated at today's discussion breakfast with businessmen that politicians have been neglecting for a long time the "serious problem" that is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think he has a good solution anymore.
Only a strong government could bring improvements, which could, moreover, lean on the wider consensus of political parties, means the President.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the Czech News Agency that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong statements. "
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit, which the former Government of Topolánek prepared for this year, is frightening, exceeds CZK 200 billion.
On Wednesday, ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
People's people were also satisfied.
Mandela played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories despite some criticisms that America's actors are making major roles.
The story tells about sports, racial relations, and Nelson Mandel.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and its first Negro president Nelson Mandela in his life story is the Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 99-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in Eastwood's movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, a 70 - year - old actor who won the Eastwood prize from boxing environments of the Million Dollar Baby has already portrayed the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
Former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for undefeated and it is the title of the poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country.
He believes that he can link his people through sports, so he decides to unite rugby players who are worldwide among outsiders.
The South African team will finally go to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for years to get Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role so as to bring it as close to reality as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found out that when I pressed your hand, I took over your energy, it transferred, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try and become another person.
Matt Damon appears in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, where white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
In the end, it was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened the doorbell, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in actors' figures compared to their real designs led by director Eastwood, Invictus received: Undefeated Positive Reviews and there are also talks of ambition for Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation into words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film. "
In the film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of the positive reviews.
Secrets of glow over Norway deciphered: Russians tested the rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed above Norway.
Only yesterday, the Russian Ministry of Defence admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile was testing near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful and the missile called the "Bulava" type, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have an appropriate effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava usually didn't take off or get damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspaper, "Bulava" is already referred to as "a rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in the order of the 13th attempt was carried out normally at first.
At the end of the flight there was again technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" took off from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donskij, who sailed beneath the White Sea.
This type of rocket makes it possible to fire a vessel that is in motion and submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an undetermined flying object was indeed broken "Bulava."
After all, the Norwegians had no doubt from the very first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time, claiming that there is no clear way to talk about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident hit third.
Previously, the engines failed in the first stage.
Although not a single test start was carried out completely without error, only six out of 13 are considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence's management.
Thus, almost 50 percent success fills the generals with optimism, so they still claim that "Bulava" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
Legendary defender Vjacheslav Fetisov will once again present himself in a professional hockey match at 51 years old.
The former World Champion, Olympic Winner and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably join KHL against St Petersburg in Friday's KHL duel.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš has been injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formalities, quoted by the AP coach of the Moscow club Sergei Němčinov.
So far, it's not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will involve just one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of other players, said Germanov.
According to AP, Fetisov will become Russia's oldest professional hockey player if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL he played the whole season for Hartford the legendary Gordie Howe attacker and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union jersey he won two Olympic gold, seven World Championships, triumphed at the Canada Cup and junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected achievements in the NHL, where in the Detroit jersey he raised twice over the head Stanley Cup.
He's been a member of the Hall of Fame hockey since 2001.
Hyundai has granted the union, cancels all overtime.
The management of the Hyundai Nošovic car company agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overtime.
It was due to the often charged overtime that the unions announced a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesperson of Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our production plan, which is essential, which is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vaněk said.
Server Seven.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
That's what people get back on Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay extra overtime or they can choose a spare leave on December 28th and thus extend their Christmas holidays by the day, says Vaněk.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive paid fare and lunch.
Since overtime was the most urgent and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesting employees, who made the production stop as a matter of fact last week, yesterday afternoon, the management decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
The employees of the car company were forced to work two more hours of overtime practically every day in the last week after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the union will call off the strike alert.
The next meeting between the company management and trade unionists is scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, the head of the union, Petr Kuchař, said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation in the car company escalated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontaneously on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against bad pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management argued that overtime must be done by employees in order to meet the requirements for car delivery.
In their announcement of the strike alert on Monday, trade unions also requested that no sanctions be imposed on workers who discontinued production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the union requires the company to mitigate overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5,000 crowns for it this year.
Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started last November.
By September this year, it produced around 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also works on 'hardened' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against medicines.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on the normal variant of the virus as some of the medicines already available.
AIDS disease cannot yet be cured.
However, a mixture of medicines that prevent the proliferation of HIV in the body may significantly prolong patients' lives.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of virus multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Heidelberg Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on proteins responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come up with new "enhanced' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metal carboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by an atom of metal, in this case with cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an HIV protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV fragmentation, there would be no mature infectious viral particles.
If we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see the table) are linked to a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in the test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of the medicines used, but does not lose its effect on resistant variants against which the medicines used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical treatments from metallocarborans make interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS went to Fischer to fight over the budget, and he's defending himself.
The chief of ODS Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget "scaring" next year, and according to him, Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS' statement a strong statement.
He says he's saving time for analysis.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House to combat the growing deficit or to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy approach to public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
The House adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with left-wing amendments for more than CZK 12 billion.
The House raised money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint at the address of the social democracy proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage the deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so it complied with the government's wishes that even the amended budget is less of a bad option than a budget make-up.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would assess the current situation.
Nečas believes that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign from office in the event of adoption of amendments, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota ordered for the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for further fight against budget deficits, according to Nečas in the government, ČSSD's nominees have nothing to do with the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other laws increasing the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions or an amendment to the Staff Law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated by ODS did nothing wrong, emphasized Topolánek in a text message from the USA.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in the Deputy Minister's office who have voted against the budget for TOP 09.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decides to resign to the principle of combating the level of government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
Then he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it's up to date, I'm going to do it, and Minister of Defense Martin Barták told the press in the House, who was nominated for the government by the citizens' Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer left for Brussels at the European Council meeting this afternoon.
At the request of Prime Minister ODS, she retreated
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House, unless the Prime Minister of Members of the Civil Democrats specifically asked for the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, and then responded to the question whether the ODS did not burden the absence of the party chair in Parliament and the Czech Republic during political budget negotiations.
I didn't see my voice missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevision of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD order, fewer trains will go for almost the same fare
From 13 December České dráhy will cancel or limit some less busy speedsters and locals, while other connections will strengthen.
The total volume of transport will decrease by two percent from the date of the new timetable.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fare, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will gain more opportunities to connect to the capital, adding one set of Pendolinos to the track.
On the other hand, the speed train stops going to Bratislava.
Less fast trains will also take off on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be significantly reduced.
From the regions, the railways plan the biggest reduction in transport in the Králové Hradec Region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to the increase.
There are also two night trains on the route Praha - Tábor - České Budějovice and the operation of several express trains on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to some days per week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice must transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end in the Prague Central Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jesenik at two-hour intervals.
Pendolinem to Bratislava will no longer be able to ride passengers from December 13th.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport is ordering and paying the speedies, totaling four billion crowns next year to pay for the so-called proven loss, as well as this year. The locals are ordering the regions, paying eight billion crowns for them in total next year, with less than three billion Czech crowns being contributed by the state.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
For locals and express trains, the tracks have a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The railroads commend the system, which is why they did not seem to affect the price increase of the overwhelming majority of tickets.
Changes will occur only for ČD Net day network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of the eLiška will newly depend on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and it amounted to 160 crowns.
Filipino gunmen are still holding over 50 people, the children have been released
Armored men in the South of the Philippines today kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which originally only informed 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 armed men say he's using the hostages as a live shield to escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree to release the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police originally chased the kidnapper over the violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was declared due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre associated with the election to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre was arrested by the governor of this South African province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
But they renewed peace talks with the Filipino government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter was performed by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose to perform years ago.
Matt Damon took part in the side role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienar.
With the introduction of the film into the cinemas they arise from the feedback of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize along with De Klerk.
He was President of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great expectations, as they come to the public at a time when, on the one hand, preparations for the world football championship culminate in South Africa, but at the same time, the media is shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to AP news agency, responses to the new film in JAR are generally positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main roles of "profly" Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new movie in his own words.
I've dreamed of that role for years, and I've prepared for it well.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to, as they say, draw on his energy, give an interview after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we can film a reminder of Mandela's personality and message.
It's the story of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
A film based on a book by British writer John Carlin with a loosely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave birth to the nation portraits South African human rights defenders during his first presidential term.
Thus, Morgan Freeman, during the film, tries to cement two racial groups and for many years mutually defined groups of the population, as well as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby jersey on the World Cup field that JAR won at the time.
For entering the lawn in a jersey, which is understood almost as sacred in the JAR, Mandela harvested 14 years ago a large ovation mostly of a white audience and gained recognition of the white population.
Perhaps the football championship can reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in the JAR improves remains to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical as LN's recent interview revealed to a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
A transformer burns in Lounsko for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was seized by the transformer of Čeps in the substation near the village of Výškov in Lounsko this morning.
In the fire, according to the spokesperson of the regional firefighters Lukáš Marvan, six units are involved.
Originally firefighters wanted the transformer to burn down, but later they re-evaluated the opinion and the fire extinguishes the mixture of water, foam and special fire fighting agents.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident according to the spokesperson of Pavla's mandate does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be precisely calculated after the end of the fire.
The destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one according to the mandate.
During the ten years of operation of Čeps nothing similar happened, the defects of this type are unique, supplemented.
According to ČEZ's spokesperson for northern Bohemia, Hendrychová Soni Holingerová was not interrupted, the operation of households, offices or companies was not affected by the fire of the transformer.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as sole operator of the transmission system, electric lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers converting electricity from transmission to distribution system and lines with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a criminal report for defamation on three officers from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura is filing a criminal report today for slander against three social-democratic captains.
And to Michal Hasek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from Pardubice Region and the Governor of Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura reported it in 20 minutes of Radiožurnál.
The action relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in certain regions.
All regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, while we only brought an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true because we know the prices of České dráhy, which were closed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's for slander against the Student Agency, he told Radiožurnála Jančura.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of a criminal report to be a continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own persons.
I am, of course, prepared to defend the good name of my country and my country, and to do the same, I will invite the other captains.
On this occasion, I suppose it will become clear that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments on regional rail transport, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that he was investing several million crowns in advertising, which will draw attention to the disadvantageous step of the regions.
He said he'd stop the campaign after Christmas, and he wants to continue after New Year's.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption itself.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and to order around 150 billion crowns did not write tender.
According to Jančura, similar behaviour is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train transport in the regions, Jančur said he threatened a Member for ČSSD as well.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which master he is, I will not say his name, he said to Radiožurnal Jančura today.
Antipneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Anti-pneumococcal vaccinations have brought down experienced practices since January.
It should be the first for families free and optional at the same time.
However, there are already voices that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination peak.
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear in the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
Children born last August 2nd and later may be vaccinated against pneumococcal free of charge from January.
The condition is that they have not received a single dose of vaccination yet.
Anyone who started vaccinations last year or before must pay for another re-inoculation.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of age of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococcals.
The parents paid CZK 1,600 for one dose and more.
Four doses are required for vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend between CZK 300 and 450 thousand per year on vaccinations.
However, it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 a year for all child vaccinations.
The restricted vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including brain blanitis and blood poisoning.
A year from now, up to 28 children under 10 die from pneumococcal infections in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced covered vaccination of children against pneumococcals in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it is to be covered by insurance undertakings and optional.
For example, the head of the civic association Nahlava Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines has long been promoting.
Experts at the international conference attended by our association were not entirely satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think that's the way we need to get on now, Kalovský said.
But the Health Department doesn't want to change the procedure for pneumococcal vaccination.
At this point, we are not considering it at all, said his spokesperson Vlastimil Hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors
President Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered a reduction in the number of re- shots "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a large amount, we can reasonably understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of fresh parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcals next year.
Anti-pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in the fact that health insurance companies, not the state, pay for it as the first general vaccination of children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save money on further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own stuff.
However, this is related to the concern of practical children's doctors who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and given to doctors in a similar way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some Members feared that insurance companies could "make money out of health insurance" in this way.
So doctors will have to shop and wait for the insurance companies to pay them off.
According to estimates, individual practical children will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'stole in a museum'
The son of a renowned American maker, Frank Frazett, was charged with attempted robbery of $20 million worth of paintings (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Named Mr. Frazetta and the second man used a digger to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81 years old, was famous for creating Barbara Conan and Tarzan characters.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Associated Press.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Mr. Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated by long-term family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazetta gave a younger affidavit, age 52, that he did so at the direction of his father, "to get into the museum in any way possible and to move the paintings into the alignment areas" as the Agency said.
Mr. Frazetta senior denied granting any such permission, as the Agency said.
Labourers resist the planned tax increase
The minists advocated an increase in taxes and cuts in expenditure, announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Torys have "missed" the opportunity to show that they are serious about delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
Even the chancellor got under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0,5% in social security and 1% of the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Reckoning about social security
The unions protested that the low-income workers were punished for a recession that was not caused and warned about "problems."
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of approximately £3 trillion a year - which has upset the community of entrepreneurs who have said that this is a employment tax, while the focus should be on economic recovery.
This increase, limiting itself to this revenue of more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS PBR
Social insurance will increase by an additional 0,5% from April 2011
The economic situation will get worse by 4.75% this year than expected.
New taxation 50% of bankers' bonuses
An increase of 1% of the company's depreciation tax on small companies
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase in pension assessment by 2,5%
According to the government's estimate, some revenue of £30,000 will be reduced by £90 a year, and some revenue of £40,000 will be reduced by £190, while some revenue of £10,000 will be increased by £110.
Ministers announced that their target of reducing the deficit in half by 2013 meant "complicated decision-making', but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of people with the highest incomes.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"They are big numbers. This will allow us to reduce the deficit in half, which is an absolutely fundamental requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said that he believes that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But the development of a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75% in this year - far worse than the decrease of 3.5%, predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A Missed Opportunity'
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning of the "debt crisis" of Labour, called the planned loan of £789 trillion over the next six years unbearable.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan for how this could be paid, added "cynically" to postpone this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They have added nothing significant that would be feasible," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so, but they wasted it."
" All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourers insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But the Liberal Democrats claim that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce deficits, arguing that the plans are "based on sand."
Political commentator BBC Nick Robinson reported on the timing of the communication - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits in next April - that this could lead to the accusation of the Chancellor in the election campaign if the money is difficult to recover a year later.
But Labourers insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September 2010.
Suspected budget'
Although ministers did not publish the details of expenditure after 2011, economists said that it is clear that reducing public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognized Institute of Budgetary Studies has reported that Chancellor's figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the building.
"It is really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election if we win them," added Roger Bootle, the economic advisor to Deloitte's accounts.
"That was the report on the suspect's preliminary budget.
FBI's conducting an investigation in 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation at a prison in Pakistan with five Americans suspected of being connected to extremists.
Men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda in the province of East Punjab, as reported by the BBC of the American Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI has reported that this is an investigation into whether these are the same men who have been declared missing in their last month's residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are reported to be native to Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors, and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested to know under what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said that the agenda had been informed of the imprisonment and had been in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washgington said that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to one of their uncles.
It stated that the house has always been the center of local police interest and that charges have not yet been filed against arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States must "co-operate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
The rejection of the amnesty for the Iranian abused.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as reported by the Amnesty International expedition report.
The report describes in detail "the ways of torture" in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men reported that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said that he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have described this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's questionable election, leading to the biggest street demolition since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were incarcerated, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, now located in London, stated that earlier in protests the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini declared the inadequacy of certain tortures and forbade their execution at Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of legal power have been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
An Untrue Confession
Amnesty International quoted a report from a 26-year-old computer science student Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he was charged with "work with Facebook" and protests against election results.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in his statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, my neck, my head... they threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubí was apprehended after protests and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants denied the rape charge, but admitted that torture was taking place.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who reported that he was held in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and reaction of the government, but stated that the mandate and powers of the institutions were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were published.
The group stated that at least 90 persons were detained in the last three weeks in order to avoid further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the memory of Bristol into a skiing track for the race.
The slope for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the slope in the park Brandon Hill was a short ski jump before the 100 m long ski slope.
John Hickman, a fourth - year student of medicine, said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was really depressing.
It was a beautiful view of the blinking lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
Prices were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the slopes.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.

Can Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called for a ban on minaret construction and generally spread alarm reports on the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and integrate - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French don't like scarves on their heads" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and the effects of which are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious view.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the ground.
He spent months in mosques, schools, and institutes that now care about 5 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproduces discussions between teachers and students on issues that worry them most.
Should Muslims join marriage in a mosque or city hall (or both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who isn't a Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seemingly worldly issues are discussed and are part of everyday life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others widely known persons, including Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim explorer and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen interviewed are inclined to believe that this is the opposite of Selafi - supporters of the Sunni Islam purist, associated in Saudi Arabia - this group is small but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He asks himself how far French politicians (and intellectual elite, which so resolutely defends the lay public) are truly committed to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he discovered "the tightening of the screws of values."
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say "Yes, but not now."
The world's bleakest prospects
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
Bordering ice melts alarming speed, affecting animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whalery describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to seize the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only with the collapsing of a musket is a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears who swam behind the bodies of their just killed mothers were caught and sent to the zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in one circus tent.
Even today, zoo enclosures typically have a million times smaller area than the area available to adults in the wild. Climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of hunters threatening the survival of species.
Even though hunting is banned in Norway, America, and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are hunted on skis and all are armed with powerful offensive hands, with which they shoot their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "Po ice" Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unhappy responsibility to science for the Arctic and a captivating glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not everything is answered by scientists.
Nor do meteorologists and oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of rehearsals.
Fridtjof Nansen's research routes at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries indicated for the first time how the motion of the floating ice occurred.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the moving over when they were underwater.
Satellite reconnaissance and extensive fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many still take place thanks to the intrepid individuals camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the arctic ice system created by the pouring of salt water that shrinks in the freezing process.
But from the seed of the bear to the microscopic wonders inside, all of this is doomed as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.

6000 Marines laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he never met.
For him and other Marines who made their way from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville in North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, that was the day in which they paid tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I do.
He was one of over 6000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veteran cemetery in several departments during the memorial act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during a memorial act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this trip every year and stop in various cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit, wreaths across America, which they lay in other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, Pentagon territory, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and a memorable flight point number 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she made a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs Hunt said it was her way of returning what the victim was doing.
It is a small way in which citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Clothed in warm cloth cloaks, volunteers went through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to the older graves of World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as the newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine to the grey tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch of the upper part.
Around 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there is real silence.
The combined service organizations donated 1000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled this area.
Some sincerely wept, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read names out loud, carved into stones, while others bowed down to see little black and white namesails, pressed into wet mud where tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes before their son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of Sergeant Navy artillery David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're single, my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
American government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as reported by the State Department officials on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Conservative officials, along with the American Interest Section in Havana, sought access to a prisoner who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain accusations have not been made, but, under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything called "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country so she could take over the prizes, but she was denied permission.
Detaining an American supplier may be a result of growing tension between the Communist brother Castro, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was followed as a "delay tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the associated states will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought after commodities in a country where the average wage of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used mostly for sending text messages because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to apply must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is a rare thing.
Most of the US citizens in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, says Gloria Berbenová, Press Officer of the Department for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
Trapped and apprehended were clearly immoral.
Such activities that would be legal in any other open society - perhaps free cell phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivance, director of the American human rights programme of the group, who recently published an unfavorable report on Cuba's freedoms, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and compensation for the ugly older brother Fidel.
Vivance said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that all solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative response in the United States, just as these two countries are heading towards a wider dialogue.
Pakistani government workers are spreading conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities uncovered an alleged conspiracy leader involving the deployment of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops and stated that they were hoping that this case might help to uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who were snooping around the Internet looking for radicalized young men.
Investigators reported that they were looking for a gray rebel personality known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men published a comment, authorising terrorist attacks on YouTube's internet video page.
Saifillah took the lead on these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get to the remote region of Pakistan in the native tribe of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaeda commanders and that men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped a few days into the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the terrible mountains of the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The official who spoke of maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case stated why they were dropped.
The official stated that the men were not intimidated and they were still trying to get consent to gain access to Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested for exercising Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI - emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
Recruiters of the organization act as guardians, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
American fake recruits were subjected to a special investigation by al-Qaeda, reported by analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because given their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years in allowing Kohu to approach them because American intelligence agencies have won experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday and demanded a stronger climate action from negotiators at the Bell City Congress Centre.
The protesters reported a number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police are thrilled that the number was closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day of the climate talks that were sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners with English inscriptions "This is not Planet B" (i.e. second-rate) and one in Spanish that said "The Earth says 'Enough'."
Several celebrities participated in the protest, including a Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who reported that she had travelled to her mother's hometown in Peru and provided me with information on the bleak state of the country in which the climate change influence is still taking place.
That is part of the reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to world leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided at all times.
Police prevented the protesters from approaching Bell's centre and said that she had detained 19 people, in the first place because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate horns, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits laid several charges near Copenhagen's main channel, located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, opened with flares, but then followed by "some big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest has probably not penetrated the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration nevertheless had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is really something I do not realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scenery is extensive, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
You can see the concentration of the general public and the various sectors and subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
The test data revealed constant racial differences
Last week's Federal Certificate of Mathematical Knowledge was a welcome element of good news about Columbia County's public education.
Although the precinct is far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth grade pupils over the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures of the National Testimonial Center for Advancement in Teaching is the continuing differences in the knowledge achieved between African-Americans and white students both locally and nationally.
The average result of the fourth-class white students in Columbia has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500) in the last two years, but their African-American peers have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has indeed increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress with African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant one-point shift from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the next six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils of the fourth classes in 2003 when the first NAEP was carried out in the district was 60 points scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in the children of the group's oboia improved during this period, the difference barely approached 58.
During the last week, some district education advocates have said that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), have been greatly stimulated by white students where the results have already been high.
This would suggest that we increased the amount of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates equality of education in the district.
I don't jump up and down because of a two or three-point spread, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown Committee (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade primary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Mrs Rhee's governance style, Mrs Brown said that the report on the results of the test means secondary education in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what's terrifying is that we didn't spend almost any time and energy that needed to be devoted to our secondary education.
Mrs Rhee said that the effort of the precinct is to continue searching for better ways to focus on the needs of low-performance students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new curriculum readings, Wilson's reading system, focused on students of higher primary schools and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their knee careers and are significantly lagging behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and curriculum of mathematics teaching to the sixth grade, emphasising the games and experiences of real life that entered the precinct behind former director Clifford Janey, can be added to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think that we should continue our work and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below class level, Mrs Rhee said.
The others stated that NAEP's results explained the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a particular dilemma for Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional procedure for redress is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia district.
Thus, the focus can bring political reverends that are directed against an important agenda.
But the criticism also belongs to other city directors who try to keep the middle ground between white and black.
We need to focus on building a large school system.
We must ensure that all families, regardless of where they live, can be confident that their children will be provided with excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now head of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to take place the right of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to push for changes, said Mr. Janey, who made a contract with his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers a "sign" for finding a bigger increase in the next year.
Making Higher Education Part of a Better Future
The tour bus entered Gettysburg railroad with a loud breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got off and rested for a moment on white pillars, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracie's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the dorms.
Now she and other eighth grade pupils in the group were exploring Gettysburg where tuition was $38690 a year, their position was rather than frightened visitors enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! That's it! she cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? She said thoughtfully when they told them the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania College was one of the seven that they visited on their three - day tour and were now completely impressed with the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a major problem concerning the large number of born children of Spanish immigrants in the United States who are expelled from universities or who become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "soul generation" of Spanish college pupils - remarkable results show that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, got to the United States without graduating from college.
Their success story is important, reported by researchers, because it highlights their point of travel forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the field of the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural attachment to school and congenital penetration and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to go to college - especially if these efforts persist over time.
Taking into account the fact that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them not to navigate in the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American area.
We need to think about providing these children with a preschool network in every way that they can go to college.
The federal program that financed Graciely's tour along the tracks is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (ready to eat), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run college preparation programs that start for students from groups with small income in secondary schools and continue until these students end college.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom have entered the college, according to US Ministry of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to reconstruct their infirm infrastructure during the two auctions on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auction fields.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached agreements on the field that was auctioned in June.
America's narrow-minded oil giants' participation in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here in the first place on the way of Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That'll be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesdays and political instability, as well as US military withdrawal, are likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has provenly the third largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, US firms have been at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not answer to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that made agreements with the Ministry.
America's leading companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The State National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become a major economic, as well as a technological force, spokesperson for Assam Jihad's oil industry.
We believe that China's company will be comparable to its competitors and will honour its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were provisionally selected for the submission of tenders which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening output above the current level in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
As the U.S. missile hits the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, a top-level planner of al-Qaeda operations was probably killed, as announced on Friday by U.S. anti-terrorist officials.
As confirmed, it could be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of terrorists.
Salah al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets landed in Thursdays on their car near Miran Śah in the province of North Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have ruled that the missiles have been launched from a non-crew-type aircraft operated by the CIA in an illegal indigenous tribal zone.
These were directed to a white car that headed to the Afghan border when it was hit, the clerk together with the Pakistani Cicillian Intelligence Agency, who was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The clerk said that local gunmen came to a point and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies. "
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorist officials quoted an unspecified witness who said that Somali was dead.
Somali was listed as a high-ranking planner for al-Qaeda military operations, who ran terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in conjectures around the world, said a senior official who does not wish to be appointed, stating the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in the attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was given instructions from Al-Qaeda's highest leadership, and based on them, he was planning possible terrorist attacks.
Another American official said that Somali quickly advanced in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a widely known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban who should be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the area of the indigenous tribes and three other top-level post-perative leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA with drones has decreased from summer to approximately six operations per month to two, according to the Long War log, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people who suspected they were informants, has stated the page.
The senior delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
The United Nations High Representative in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he wanted to resign from his post in March, ending a turbulent term of office that was undermined by accusations of widespread corruption in the election of the president in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure occurs because the Obama administration has decided to send another 30000 American troops to Afghanistan.
The United Nations delegate said that he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for reducing the situation that starts in 18 months should be a challenge for NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment taken must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it is high time to look for the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started looking for a replacement.
Officials have stated that it is decided between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who previously led the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the presidential election of the country by masking the presence of massive electoral machination.
Eide denied these claims, but he said that the accusations of Galgraith -- who was released -- "definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism in terms of international intervention" in the election.
Eide stated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens to coordinate lightening efforts at the leadership of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so as he says, he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money was used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of his efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the cumbersome regulations of the United Nations on hiring undermine her ability to exploit her abilities.
The rules of the UN are that I had the opportunity to acquire only one person from May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "another major sanctions" on Iran due to a lack of involvement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey to the areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, has been racking up the prospect of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's request for probable development. "
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inherent unpredictability of war.
Obama's administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and inhibitions " would require" to force the Iranian government to actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons " because "its inhabitants will suffer extremely" sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration has included European leaders in the warning that Iran will bear serious consequences unless it brings its nuclear programme into full compliance with the UN Committee on Nuclear Safety and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks about limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial proportion of his uranium-enriched supplies in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to withdraw from the interim agreements - partly because the expert states, because the Imam leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, with regard to Iran's stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degraded sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian UN mission condemned on Thursday what it called "unsubstantiated and unfounded accusations" to some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an adequate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before he flew to the Kurdistan region, oil-rich to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There is a high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, particularly because of borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent the US's delay in reducing US troops from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen Kurdish concerns about the ongoing depression. The official U.S. places quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzaani, President of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one more grave."
Then they learned that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and aging populations in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn't save anything for others, says Wang, 31 years old, a human resource manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby and spoiled children, the "little emperors" that are aptly nicknamed, endangering the country's population crises.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per pair compared to six, compared to UN figures, before politics has taken effect.
The division of the population, where the population of 60 years of age and above is predicted to grow from 16,7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is far above the total average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is more rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above accounted for almost 22 percent of the population registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and reduce the number of workers in the future."
He says it's about being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Gradual soothing
As inserted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate established by the Communist Party.
The two who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official posts advocated a policy that helped the country prevent the critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in the promotion of politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion during the second child.
Moreover, many couples had to have sexistically selective abortions leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have gradually been milder in their opinion on one child's policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exemptions - including urban residents, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were only children - and in 2007 they reduced the diction of their hardline passwords.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Population Research Institute, said that central government officials had previously discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became China's first city to launch an aggressive campaign to incite multiple births.
Nearly overnight, posters, encouraging parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations, detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, reported by family planning officials.
Grieving Response
Although officials in a rural town in Shanghai's neighborhood noticed an increase in interest among couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign started, most city districts did not report changes.
Huinan County with a population of 115000, for example, has still registered four to five cases a month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still only expected to be around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's fourth Caol said that financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn't want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that she would like to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a privileged clue network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West judge one child's policy badly as an issue of law, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in a relationship with the first child during the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of a chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only political.
It's about the money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the Human Resources Manager, says that they only want one child, because she was an only child: "We were the center of our families' attention and everyone cared for us.
We were not used to provide care, and we did not really want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who owns a translation company, expressed it much more indiscreetly.
For middle - class 2-cared parents who have reduced birth rates, he said that being successful is being selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds, growing up, view parents as breaking through the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of living for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still issues of propstor -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You must have a résumé prepared at a time when the child is nine months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group outlined a plan for reducing emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterised by far-reaching undisciplined attitudes and mutual ennoblation -- refocused on Friday on the release of a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations carrying most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But important progress was seen in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with over 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text states inconspicuously how much money rich countries should provide for the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can reduce their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, head of the Sierra Washington Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, described the briefing from 180 pages of the text from the meeting to focus on what the UN's top climate officer, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture."
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by year to 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union discussed quickly on Friday the promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years in order to help poorer countries accept adaptation to climate change -- from dealing with floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But he still said Friday the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed during last week's interviews.
The US Special Envoy on Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected the speech demanding binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to volunteering for major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The shift signaled that Obama's administration had established a harder line to China than Bush officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the transfer of the main developing countries and the implementation of the actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "sile sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibleness" led earlier in the week to the message that the United States would not help financially China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the world's major powers at stake, the pulls broke out both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States for fulfilling their respective obligations, while poorer nations point out that the two dozen most influential countries in the world ignore the scientific imperative to carry out the most powerful events.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from taking responsibility for their actions.
This is clearly a game about the development of new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who also serves as regional advisor to regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable effects of climate change indicated that they wanted to continue promoting a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants, said that the best outcome of the talks would be political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the promotion by small island nations "has called up political plkak for the whole of the political process" partly because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations brought about a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the Heads of Government faced an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of the aircraft and ran through the Bell Centre Halls to close the meeting doors and new conferences so that they could lay down the demands that will be assessed next week.
The vastness of the assembly - when 13000 people moved from and to the congress centre every day, guitars played by activists were staged at night by ironic spectacles about the countries they thought they had sent them, and proposals were handed over from hand to hand on paper rather than by electronic mail - controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is merely an extension: almost all the key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of 60 Heads of State.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy on International Nature Conservation.
Heavyweights are coming.
The British first train at 140 miles per hour redefined this Monday's feelings
At 5:13 a.m. Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness as a sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches 140 miles per hour and passes from Ashford, Kent, to London's St Pancras and exceeds 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal set outside lLndýn.
It hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
The neglected standing waters should shorten the transport times in passenger transport and on commercial routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were allowed to acquire themselves for this vision.
But dozens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects and environmental concerns have now slowed down the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a viable study to the government, transmitted its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times indicated.
She provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next scheduled high-speed network.
The new route of London's connection to West Midland was designed within five metres of urban areas and neighborhoods where living environments could be difficult.
In the open landscape was planned up to 25 m the final route.
HS2 also envisages identifying three options for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred choice is the conformation of the shape of the letter Y, where one high-speed track should lead to Western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle above Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most powerful choice has been made," said the railway expert.
Once this is done, the travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should allow trains to travel at 2250 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The starting line is already designed to kidnap trains of 400 m in length that would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham track.
This means that London terminal would be able to serve up to 20000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be extended to include a high-speed network.
Rail industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he means or does not intend to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that whatever the final decision does not occur before the general elections.
Even if the wheels are set in motion, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing lines north of Birmingham and keep driving times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, an indicative point for the revolution on rail.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of 75000 pounds for the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, holder of the Tory front seat in the Chamber of Deputies, paid the taxpayers thousands of pounds of costs last year for the orangery he built in his home in the constituency.
The party spokesperson behind the prison who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that Members lived "out of rations" increased their mortgage to 75000 pounds to build oak-covered enlargements in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, total hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims on time, so they were not interrogated by Sir Thomasen Legg, who controlled the members' expenses. Mr Duncan made his demands last night "it could be cleaner or easier."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two two-storey houses on a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the tax office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is marked "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "a greenhouse for entertainment and entertainment. "
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privilege in the latest mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the coupon security to a mortgage of £271406 from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the Chamber of Deputies.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over £1,800 a month.
The interest in the repayment of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage could not be altered at this time, which suggests that all this was intended to finance a loan of 75000 pounds.
The standard variable RBS mortgage mortgages fell from 7,94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, which remained.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 for a month this May.
Mr Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after one secret newsman filmed it and said that Members had to survive the "rational" after the expense scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on a ration and you're treated like a [Bleep]."
He said: "I spent money on my garden and claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
A Member, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first invited to explain his editions in May when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the Financial Authority that it "may be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the Financial Authority and then by Legg. "
He added: "This is not an issue of hiding and twisting or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified, and that's it.
This would not be able to be many other ways cleaner or easier."
Come and see the cabin on the coast of Brighton with an Advent calendar.
The coastal cottages in Brighton found a new meaning of life in winter as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that inspires the savvy enjoyment of creativity called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages every day in December, and to use the Christmas carousels as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when it allowed visitors to see the last cabin from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the Bishop's bread and welded wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the chalet represented the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant to TV marketing from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in post - Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come into a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of an Advent calendar in chats was created just like an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it spiritually."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people came out on Saturday to the streets demanding a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be accepted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where hundreds of people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
According to police sources and 100,000 organizers, at least 30,000 people demonstrated cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN Climate Conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, said that the growing global mobilization, with clear evidence of current demonstrations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to journalist AFP, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, when a group of about 300 protesters dressed in black began to break their expenses with tile cubes and hammers.
The order police immediately stepped in.
In total, police reported the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultraradical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred were in handcuffs and sitting "maintained in the streets on Saturday night" despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade went quietly to the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
For the speakers, a stage was built before which a spiritual meeting took place during candles with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities, and besides Africans there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "righteous climate."
Today we are going to the streets to demand a balance of ecological debt in favor of the south, explaining Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer think: for that is the time, declared the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and watercourses are drying up, and today we can walk in them, and that has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the fighting movement for another world has drawn closer to environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said that he had arrived in Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice." "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people came out on the streets in Australia.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, in red clothing and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters went out on the streets, demanding strong measures against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in protests organized by the '350' movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Several dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "fragile"
On Saturday, Abkhazia elected its president, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step as a "fragger."
Some 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections following the Russian-Grussian war in August 2008 to control South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The polling rooms closed in 17 hours of GMT.
According to the officials of the Abchaz Election Commission, attendance was 58% a few hours before the closure of the polling rooms.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned this election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili " regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, they recognised the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants only Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said AFP Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to the polling room at the school in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian supremacy is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapš are deployed alongside Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gaul, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful course of the elections received a warm welcome from the district mayor Beslan Aršba.
"We, Abchaz, are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, and toasted it with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice President Raul Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the rail network of Abkhazia for a period of 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive battle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifesting in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people came out on Saturday to the streets demanding a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on that occasion.
According to police sources and 100,000 organizers, at least 30,000 people showed in cold weather this afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, acting on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade went quietly to the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
For the speakers, a stage was built before which a spiritual meeting took place during candles with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to journalist AFP, incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to break expenses.
The order police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, while several manifestants knocked them down.
In total, police reported the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultraradical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a cobblestone officer on the jaw was injured and four cars were lit near a squat near the incidents that resulted in police arrests of about 20 people.
We concentrate on extremist groups, warned police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police again flew into the air.
Most protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for the "righteous climate."
Today we are going to the streets to demand a balance of ecological debt in favor of the south, explaining Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said that he had arrived in Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice." "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
Oxfam has called on several famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen, or former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people came out on the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people showed up in front of the city hall of the capital of the Philippines, mostly students in red clothing and scarves of the evocative importance of solar energy.
Several hundred demonstrators also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta with the requirement of strong measures against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in protests organized by the '350' movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Several dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened in the reform of the General Gymnasium, said Chatel.
On Sunday, during an interview with JDD, Minister of Education Luc Chatel said that the subjects of history and geography will be "strongened" in the reform of general grammar schools, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the final year of grammar school focusing on exact sciences.
Now all students will have a second year four hours a week and for all will be the same program from general culture, confirmed by Chatel.
According to the minister, "there is a need to end hypocrisy," because according to him, the specialization of S is no longer focused on exact sciences," but "in essence they are the best students in it."
EC and L specializations cannot be for some kind of sub-specialization, continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would make it difficult for them to learn geography and history in the last year of professional grammar schools."
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by Humanité, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography in the S-specialization senior year, so many intellectuals and teachers criticized the cancellation, both left and some Members of the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not applicable" to abolish philosophy in the program of specialization with the senior year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel prevented reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilisation against this project, which, according to them, is sacrificing the pedagogical education of future professors of grammar schools.
Within Master's degree 2 (M2) he will undergo an entrance exam focused on their field at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year another examination verifying their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
He will attend professional internships during the second year of his Master's degree and will be a professor-intern in front of the students for the first year.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education" which does not yet exist in national education.
Reconfirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite university of École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the call announced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As reported by an AFP journalist, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of 15 minutes of experts' contributions to be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them more eager to learn something more, explained at the conference by 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after the fish from the local pond, which was named by students.
About 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be chosen and stated that the selection is based on their charisma.
Regarding climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic targets in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of 50 listeners without pre-prepared remarks, using graphs only.
It is part of our scientific work, he emphasized with the hope that the audience will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific foundation"
Videos made at these lectures will be placed on the school website from 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Late payment: angry prison guards, planned measures
On Friday, the prison guards' unions announced "general mobilisation', demanding that premiums and overtime be paid to them by Christmas holidays, the remuneration of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
The prison FO (2nd supervisory union) requested staff who would not be on duty to participate in a demonstration held on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities to "block" them so as to draw attention to "theft of their wages."
ECT for prison guards (3rd departments of this sector) called on them to "call meetings in individual prisons and start a major mobilisation" with the fact that it is "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtimes and extras for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" worked in October should not be paid in December.
The first supervisory unions, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for total mobilisation (...) in order to show discontent and indignation. "
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased a lot in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellor stated that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison guards' union, which assures them that the payment would be made next month.
I know about the efforts the prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister in his communication.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures so that the situation that arose by a poor evaluation of the number of overtime has never been repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
Thus, the December wage will be low, with the exception of managers who receive the famous bonus for carrying out their duties and achieving their objectives, states Ufap/Unsa, and for those "there is always room in the budget'.
It is simply a scandal, the FO Interregional Union in Marseille was indignant and announced its decision to boycott "all meetings and subpoenas" until further notice.
Workers do not come to work on Sundays or on holidays unless the extra payments for these days from October will be paid in December, as well as for overtime, are also threatened by FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more work without giving us more staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for it, reports CGT-incarcerators in Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are not enough, stated the Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" than the ones he gets at Christmas.
American President Barack Obama, who prepares for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided to Oprah Winfrey's "goddess" screen that as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I receive."
The President and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at ABC about how they are going to spend Christmas and end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a little four-legged family partner, gets his share.
Baby Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama that the dog also "of course" gets a gift, as follows from the excerpts from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also opposed her husband's claim to the quality of gifts that she receives: "Oh, absolutely not, I gave you great gifts last year," teased the president.
Well, that's true, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but right after that, with humor, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace, "Who gave you this?"
During this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous host, who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama's husbands also talked about their most unpopular gifts as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bicycle with a ten-degree gearbox, but also a basketball, which he donated at Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely met.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas, and when he gave me the basketball, the president told me.
Long after that, I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The First Lady was reminiscing about the dollhouse.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I evened out all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday is back in surgery, RTL says he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles because of the "injury" resulting from a larger operation he had in France, but the situation is according to his nearest "under control" while RTL station stated that the singer is in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday nights at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors stated that "the injuries resulting from the operation" of the carved disk he had experienced in Paris on 26 November told Paris his press department that these lesions required "correction."
However, the press department of the singer tried to calm the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical communication would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "pains and complications."
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll have a little bit more certainty, he adds RTL.
The Press Department did not confirm or comment on this information when asked by AFP.
RTL also states that according to "some sources" no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic because of a carved disk.
The surgery scheduled for several days in advance was performed by a neurosurgeon Stephane Delajoux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL information.
After this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on Thursday on RTL that his boyfriend was going through a "bad time," but he added that he "does not worry" about the rocker because he is a great "fighter."
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like this is no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation, stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to antibiotics " and that the infection was "stopped. "
Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the wife of a singer, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only been multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small small tumor of the small intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour of "Tower 66" which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every health problem has been monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to dement a report on a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championship in the big pool, won on Thursday the 2009 European Championship in a small swimming pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m free way.
On the first day of the championship, on which the last jumpsuits are allowed, only three world records fell, although much more were expected.
One of them surpassed Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová at 200 m position race and two remaining male relay of Russia at 4x50 m position race.
A great sorrow for Bousquet, who has set a world record of 50 m free in a way that he already holds in a large swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m free way, the 28-year-old Frenchman won the final time of 20.53 seconds in the finals, where ten swimmers premiered instead of eight.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84) but failed to overcome the world record (20.30) as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if there's a world record within my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from 1 January.
The overalls helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of a jumpsuit this time did not help even the German Paul Biedermann, twice the world champion in the big pool in Rome this summer, who had the world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record that holds 400 meters free way (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew I wouldn't beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent for the future, explained by Biedermann.
USA: the record of the Romanesque sarcophagus belonging to Zola was sold out for $1.5 million
The board of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to no one other than French writer Emile Zola, was sold out for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said Sotheby's art dealer.
The price of this two - foot - long and 63 cm - high front plate, originating in the third century C.E., was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
Marble "presenting four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes is a rare work, similar pieces in the world are very few, perhaps four or five," said AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the object that was most bidable, the spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told the AFP agency.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was found a few days ago.
The album was in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous Borgia family collection and then gradually appeared at the French actress Cecile Sorelová, who decorated her bathtub in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the minister of the third Republic in France and shortly the President of the Council before the rise to the power of Marshal Petain.
She stayed shadowed there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz found that this record was part of the "Resides of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart" when he searched the museum database in Louvre.
An aborted attempt at President Zelay's departure from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico concluded that the conditions for the transport of the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not met.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything suggests that there is no way to make this transfer possible, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador for President Zelaya, flew back again, reported the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Pučist government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demise" and to apply for political asylum abroad, it would only provide him with the opportunity to leave safely.
But the overthrown president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The Pučist government "has experienced another failure when it wanted me to give up my post (...), wanting me to resign" said on Thursday Zelaya's Globo radio, in which it often comments on the political crisis that has been going on for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, he's supplied the overthrown president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's played a few chords.
Mexico's Embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept this because it does not contain an asylum application, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Pučist Government, Oscar Raul Matute to Hondura Radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for Telesur station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I leave as president of the Honduran people, he emphasized.
Rumours of Zelay leaving mobilized in the midst of supporters of the overthrown president who came to gather around Brazil's embassy, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coupinist government.
They show their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28th, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on September 21st and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he'll be arrested and held responsible for the crime of treason that he's accused of, the coup government claims.
President Roberto Micheletti of the Czech Republic succeeded in organising the presidential election on 29 November to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections, recognised by the United States, but convicted Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo has won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street is rising, US trade balance is encouraging optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and US trade balance results testifying to an increase in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final deadline, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68,78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7,13 points to 2190.06 points.
Standard & Poor 500 improved by 0.58% (6,40 points) to 1102,35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take this too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on "half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The United States' trade balance deficit dropped by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32,9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
Great news is the increasing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com.
However, unemployment increased in the United States last week against all expectations and the number of job applicants reached 474,000.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The proceeds of the state treasure with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482% compared to 3,423% on Tuesday night and the return to 30 years increased to 4.492% versus 4.40% the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of the regime booed "Ladies in White"
Several hundreds of Cuban regime supporters booed on Thursday the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented further demonstrations for which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Dam in White ", wives or close political prisoners were booed right on the street by the supporters of the Raul Castro regime on their march towards the capital centre, demanding the release of political prisoners, reported the journalist.
Down with the Yankees!, "The Mercenaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted with a raised fist supporters of the regime to dissidents.
Finally, dissidents were escorted by civilians who arrived "to ensure security. "
The day before that, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against "Ladies in White," but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about ten dissidents were arrested by the civil police, who were also about to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, police loaded dissidents who were booby-trapped by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
Arresting dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The winners of the European Parliament's 2005, "Ladies in White," organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, of about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their archenemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television brought a report on Thursday's demonstration of the supporters of the government regime against the "revolutionists."
Cuba, with the Communist Party in charge of one party's government and policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary findings of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in or before the pharmacy, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of police and witnesses.
A badly injured old man, born in 1929, died from injuries, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate in the hospital.
In this pharmacy or in front of it, the assailant attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband in his early 30 ' s began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80 - year - old man died.
The life of the other injured is in danger, according to police sources, the vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transported to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source said, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two other people, probably by accident: a 30-year-old male and 40-year-old male, the other one seriously.
How all this happened is not quite clear, because everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, carrying a cross behind his back, said at the position of head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-bys, including young people, have, according to the testimony gathered by the AFP, tried to stop and disarm the madman.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation of Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd threw up, including a city cop who broke his wrist while doing so.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, number 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to apprehend an armed man while being wounded with their fists, reported a police source.
The incident occurred on one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The passers-by came to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a large wound to the abdomen, told the AFP Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second about 30 - year - old person came in who also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have ID on him later arrested by the state police.
The State Attorney in Nanterre handed the matter over to the Regional Police Department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting for an interrogation.
A police source didn't rule out his location in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six police officers to handle him at a police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "outside himself" as "all the madmen of this type, whose strength in action is increasing tenfold."
U.S. attorney Polansky once again requests that the prosecution be terminated.
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Roman Polanski again applied in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) on Thursday to stop prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of the moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, director of the film "Pianist," criticized three judges of the second district's appeal court in California for serious errors during the trial at the time of the 1977 events.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and immediately, said lawyer Hummel and added that Laurence Rittenband's behavior of the judge who then ruled on the matter "had chills in his back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was supposed to deal with the prosecutor before the judgment was pronounced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison - a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the state's attorney David Wells himself.
But Mr. Wells finally said at the end of September that he was lying to the author of the document.
In case the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Hummel's lawyer will demand a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The plaintiff repeated what has already been said at the first state, namely that there will be no serious study of the application to halt the prosecution until Roman Polanski is brought to trial.
A 76-year-old director escaped from the United States in 1978 before the court passed judgment on "illegal sexual intercourse" with a teenage girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never again entered the United States.
Attorney General in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial"
In this case, we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs Assyria.
He believes that the director " requests kindness from the court and also despises his authority. "
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Hummel's lawyer wasn't the only one asking to stop Roman Polanski's prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also asked for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer endure the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case surfaced and added: "No one in this room could say that the trial was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26th in Switzerland by order of the USA
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he waits for possible eviction.
Wall Street ends with no direction, it's being held back by a rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market is torn between indicators that are better than expected in the US and rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final deadline, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0,37% (4,06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased very much, and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by publishing economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve the mood in the market as regards the stability of economic recovery', reports Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1,3% in November, for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to the preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of US consumers also returned and in December increased strongly to 73,4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices have been halted by a new rise in the dollar price against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which is "pressing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are thus losing ground.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield of the state treasure with a view to 10 years increased to 3,540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and increased to 4.49% on 30 years compared to 4.4922% on the day before.
Miss World's choice again in South Africa.
After a month's travel across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates on Saturday are about to cross the finish line to reach their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty was held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year and so far five candidates have gained progress to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Mao from Canada were elected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real vortex of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen so many things and I've had so many experiences!, she confided in Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. (15 p.m. world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country where I put my crown on.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have experienced it twice, confided in Miss Ksenia Sukhin in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "airlands that are blowing out of breath."
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priya Chopra, elected in 2000, who also took part in the election by Aishwary Rai, a 1994 winner who both became the stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just a look.
We are ambassadors to our countries and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be introduced in traditional costumes and swimsuits, of course.
The performance will be presented by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean and chairman of the Miss World's Steve Douglas Committee.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome a world of warmth that is hard to cope with, declared Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Competition.
The candidates, like last year, participated in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, Miss Sierra Leone remarked.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (Southwest of the Earth) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little bit more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to World Cup 2010, says with enthusiasm Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, reports of the state of Hallyday are "very positive. "
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive" as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday during the exit from the plane, which arrived from Paris shortly after the 13th hour of local time (the 21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said that "as quickly as possible" would arrive at the Los Angeles Hospital Cedars-Sinaï, where Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to post-operative infection resulting from surgery of the prolapsed intervertebral disc, which he underwent on 26 November in Paris.
According to a press release, the singer's night in Los Angeles was "indulged in artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles already put into an artificial sleep. Hospitalization occurred due to an infection after surgery of prolapsed intervertebral plates made on November 26 in Paris.
Due to serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated again on Wednesday night for Thursday.
According to AFP's photographer's information, his wife Laeticia attended the French lyceo school performance in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The priority of the department of orthopedic surgery and trauma of the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he was leaving for the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer harshly accused Dr Stéphan Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday"went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I myself suffered twice with the prolapse of the intervertebral disc, he added.
Shortly before, the radio station RTL said that the singer apparently flew off after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic, which he was working on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg during the removal of the hematoma resulting from the brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the Olivier Metzner Medical Chamber described him as "a man without scruples " who is "regularly" summoned before a medical chamber, and who cannot be "advised from far away" either.
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his attorney David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure was "absolutely good" and the postoperative examination was "normal."
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, therefore the introduction of the drain was not necessary', added.
The singer's health problems have been growing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (Amiens, notes red.) seems too close, said Camus.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to continue not to use their abbreviation.
On Friday, UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayrou, responded to the attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to take advantage of the abbreviations of the former Giscard Party, stating that the abbreviation must not be used in any medium under the threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the UDF shortcut with the fact that François Bayrou did not deserve to bear her inheritance after he handed his hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mr Hervé de Charett (former under-UPP now for NC), who credites the ownership of the UDF brand because he first registered it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle).
But on Friday night, the UDF Committee managed by friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, stepped out of his silence and made a formal request to the Minister and Members to stop using the shortcut and hand back ownership of the trademark, under the threat of prosecution.
In the last few days, you have raised disturbing statements that you will propose to your political movement +receiving the UDF, in a letter signed by 19 members of the committee, such as François Bayra and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance centre.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement, with the slogan +UDF today+, also the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, the UDF Committee, which requests the NC movement to remove all references to the UDF name immediately from all promotional materials including (its) websites".
At the same time, it asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of the trade mark to legitimate owners'.
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the UDF members, pointing out the signatories.
In their letter, they state that UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and reminds Mr Morin and his friends that "chosen " departure in 2007 " to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002 to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau centre movement therefore, according to them, has no right to use UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoD for three years and to set up a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association established by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered a trademark," he has not been a member of UDF for three years, but a UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent registration of the acronyms to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion begins to turn into a crime, claiming, and then comments with irony on NC's strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to create a name for itself than to come out of anonymity by fraudulent acceptance of a name that we do not have the right to".
The case of Lilian Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the condition of weakness.
On Friday, the Nanterre court decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier and to pass judgment as to whether he had used the weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which is what her daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, blamed for.
Photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs famous, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, a criminal offence for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros is imposed.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case which can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter are attacking each other and fighting for the management of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by the College of three doctors.
L'Oréal's heiress and main shareholder has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre State Prosecutor during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time state whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and in which period.
I think he'll take it.
I'll talk to her about the matter, and after the hearing, Ms. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman, said.
As far as attorney François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he welcomed the decision of the court.
It is an excellent report (...). Expertise will show that he has manipulated this old lady who needs protection (M. Banier).
Two years ago, the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and an artist who is accused of using her mother's weakness for years to earn a billion euros in cheques, life insurance contracts, or master paintings.
But Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the lawsuit brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's lawyer's court speech changed at the moments into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's attorney submitted three letters to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), expressing her distrust of Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State Attorney in Nanterre once again found that the complainant's conduct was not justified, all the more so that the guardian judge in those days rejected her request to initiate legal protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the trial, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," the prosecutor confirmed, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court ruled that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to comment at the time of the opening of the trial.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for economic intelligence was useless...
For more than ten years, the behaviour of management of large companies towards employees has reminded companies of their approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about identifying co-workers with "values" determined from the mountain, as it was before, when it was necessary to impose on consumers products that emerged from the ideas of factory engineers' heads.
By becoming the centre of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the market acquisition strategy in the right direction...even though authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, are regularly returning!
The passive approach of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which mainly affects management cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "needs from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires from employees commitments that are completely contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call for a management revolution which should aim to bring workers to the heart of the company's interest as well as the client's.
Relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to a revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mostly because I've already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after different turns will come back to what it's always done!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathology of power, increases in proportion to the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Since they are graduates of engineering universities, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their mental comfort, they are learning an old behavioral theory, now reanimated by "neursciences" from the US and widely distributed without greater knowledge of the scientific constitution and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the "sic" of the involvement of managers, the recent survey of the Ipsos agency on Figaro.fr website, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical control, inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses assumes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists of incorporating a fundamental observation into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the enterprise will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only the study Motivated functional analysis deals with this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their businesses on the basis of a pre-defined doxy which will enable them, through an image that tells them about the company, to assess what they offer to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anti-cipate on their "social performances" and put their human resource management "on the right path."
This creates fertile ground for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
By expressing Oslo: "just war " Obama earned praise from the right hand.
On Friday, the US right welcomed the speech that Barack Obama gave the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize winner for 2009 defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who at first mocked Obama's award on October 9 applauded this time the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former Vice President's candidate for the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a muse of the right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. Today, and added that she herself expressed herself on this topic "sometimes necessary" wars in her memoirs that are just coming out.
War, of course, is the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified sending forces and used his speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world."
In a way, I considered this speech entirely historical, declared Gingrich during an interview on "The Takeaway" radio.
Former Member, who some consider to be a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the "left-wing president" reminding the Nobel Committee members that they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the peace prize if the use of force did not exist"
According to Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush's speeches, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama gave a "very American speech. "
He not only introduced himself as a "world citizen" as always, but "spoken like the American President" and reminded Europeans that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they do not do too much to preserve it," Gerson evaluated.
Among the few discontents of the right is the Hawk of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "single, pompous and uninspired" as stated on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the President, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama, as he justifies the use of forces.
"When we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-left press takes a commendation to the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to regard the award of peace to Obama as premature, he considered his performance "excessive" even for a speaker known for his talents.
Oslo's speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in combating poverty and oppression," reports the California daily.
Obama "said the speech as needed, evaluated the New York Times, and called the speech "simple and informative. "
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement that saves the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, the road transport unions and TLF, the only employers' organization left to the end, came to an agreement on Friday night that ended the call for strike and the threat that was hanging over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" on Friday at the signing of the agreement after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unosra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But it took another more than six hours of meeting, which began at 11 o'clock, for everyone to agree and at 18 o'clock to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would very much hurt businesses, " and" the danger of disrupting the holidays at the end of the year " was stated by Bussereau.
The text includes a 4% increase in wages for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we will order our members to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may still be a few opposers who are not satisfied, " he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "the right agreement," although it was hard to admit high salaries due to the international competition."
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, declared CMaximum Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement."
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise."
The agreement also envisages the revaluation of travel expenses of 3% and the report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also enable the focus to be on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million in corporate wages taxes" which was the subject of the Government's amendment to the 2009 Budget Bill, which was voted on by the National Assembly on Thursday night to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for a "coordinated" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organisation, later to the whole field, in case of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time," assured Bussereau.
The whole process can only slow down the opposition of employers' organisations.
The FNTR is talking about "bad trade" because EUR 100 million "has already been offered to the sector as part of the compensation for part of the carbon tax."
The Minister of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but as a result of not angering turkey eaters at the time of the coming Christmas holiday, Unosra complained.
For Otre, there is a risk that the agreement will "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field" in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: traffic interruptions on weekends, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP's proposals.
The interruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because Friday's negotiations between the unions and RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of the premium application.
On Saturdays and Sundays, i.e. the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only travel between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will ride outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will thus be forced to transfer to another train.
Galleries Lafayette's department stores, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "raTP was trying to secure a connection with large business houses."
The RER A line leads west to east of Paris' agglomeration.
The section administered by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
One of the two trains was in operation on Friday and practically no set was running at the time off the top, as planned.
Just as on Thursday, the people of Ile de France had arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were a lot less people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye Station (Yvelines) than usual, among other things because they were missing pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time.
Saint-Lazare Railway Station was not crowded, it announced the state railroad of SNCF, because a larger number of bailiffs and peacekeepers were predicted.
Suburban trains RER A operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left from Saint-Lazare Station with a connection to the metro.
Other general gatherings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, where the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the leaders, which the trade unions considered to be "weak" will be evaluated.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban trains RER and on all aspects, adjustment of working time, career course, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved bonus, according to Thierry Garon (South Union).
RATP has even postponed its proposals for the premium for the time being, which has offended ECT with the fact that the management "was unable to solve the problem while it was possible for travel carriers and SNCF."
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "a closer review of the conditions for the pursuit of the profession', RATP indicated.
Which is why the union thinks that the company "makes fun of weekend passengers"
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the corporate committee at its headquarters in Paris.
The leadership, which so far refused any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calm down."
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents announce a strike alert.
The trade unions ask for a premium of between EUR 120 (Unsa) and EUR 150, of which EUR 30 (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and complain about the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which transports millions of passengers daily.
Drivers of suburban trains RER earn gross wages in more advanced career times 2200 to 2700 euros and 600 to 650 euros bonuses for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish party, and this decision has severe consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-curdian party in the country. This decision immediately provoked protesting demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the government's task, which seeks to lend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its inseparable unity," said the President of the Supreme Court of Hasim Kilic to journalists after four days of negotiations.
The decision was unanimously adopted by 11 judges, when the majority-seven votes were needed for the dissolution of the party, Kiliç stated and added that 37 party cadres, including its President Ahmet Türk and Aysela Tugluk's Member, are prohibited from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (from 500).
The party's leadership pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as non-political Members.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Appeal Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Kurdistan Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is a legal political case of PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic link" with the PKK, but refuses to identify it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the court comes when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a recurrence of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being held in conflict with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, mostly Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, protesters threw Molotov's cocktails or shot stones out of slingshots.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of justice would only "promote despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurds, note red.) by banning the party, declared in the press.
The government, made up of a party arising from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We're on principle against party interference.
It doesn't solve anything, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete sniper of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can look forward to a reaction from PKK, he added.
On Thursday, PKK claimed one of the most murderous attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
♪ Snow can come ♪
Pretty crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES Winter Technical Services Department.
But so that his employees could try and learn how to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time in the weekend, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to the precise plan.
Once it snows all over Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they go on 20 so-called stretches and large sprinklers, explains Brauburger.
These sections include major and transit moves such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and falling sections such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle the wet salt that is better held within a maximum of three hours, about 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night "to keep the roads free when they start right to work"
It's hard when it only snows at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Technical Services Department, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers."
Only when it doesn't snow so much are the arrival and interconnection roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side roads and the side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pawns are on their way, preferably cleaning up dangerous places and crossings.
FES can't usually take care of all the bike paths.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which follows from 22 to 4.30 mainly bridges, says Brauburger.
As the iceberg is formed quickly, the sprinklers leave immediately when the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two metres long and 1.50 metres high, ran on two strong rear limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sickle claws and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas, Austin, and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical characteristics.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to earlier dinosaur evolution, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about family relationships, enlargements and early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, it's unprecedented for triasus deposits, informs a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of early dinosaur history.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun God of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of the dinosaurs of the trias are very rare, mostly only individual fragments are found. "
Other dinosaurs don't share this enthusiasm without reservations.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of Bonn University.
In the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, therefore the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards split into three most important development lines: carnivorous therapists, to which Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and birds, long necks, four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (the bird-kickopan), including, for example, Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues the original terapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, researchers found evidence of air bags on the skull of Tawa hallae, which even the descendants of the therapists have birds.
Thanks to air bags, bird breathing is more effective than mammals.
In Tawa hallae, even the spine bones were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the family line of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, it probably created this useful innovation already a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs still known were living in South America, scientists have suggested that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines were soon divided and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time, as a supercontinent Pangea, formed a uniform earth mass.
It would also speak of the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found remains of two others, not particularly closely related to the therapists.
Those three can't come from one common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs have remained, and on other continents they are rarely found.
As the dinosaurs proved that from the relatively rare sideline of the reptile family, they evolved to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the time of the Middle Ages, it remains still a riddle.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
About the end of the triasus, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while relatives died out and the interface of the triasus and the jury.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses how to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extinctions that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but reptiles didn't.
Or dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push out the competition.
In any case, the history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the meteor shower helped another group of animals, which also evolved in triassic and lived in shadow since then: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
The professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paula, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University has taken care of the worldwide commotion.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth University, as well as universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidaritying with protesting students on Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English they "do not approve" the prezidia-enhanced police intervention.
Since the walls and works of art were scribbled, University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied last week by strikers and lecturers.
At the same time, five students were injured.
Damage to the cause, judges by signatories, does not justify the "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching by students and teachers by police commandos."
Eliminating represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves for "incorrectity and criminalization of protests" and distracts attention from content.
The presidium has avoided the necessary discussion.
Lecturers call for a halt to criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support material damage.
A Rightful Protest
Also, the youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union are solidaritying with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for the future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hesen Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has defended the procedure of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destroying and casting are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday at the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Land Assembly.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said Peter Beuth to the MP for the CDU.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it.
CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalize protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, there was an eviction.
Linke filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, they have been paying for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow's capital, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from the Moscow Center, is considered to be "Russian Silicon Valley."
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, Greenograd representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - universities and firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were multiple mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protokol on close cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's Vice-Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, who was signed by Edwin Schwarz, Head of Planning Officer for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in scientific research will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ's companies will be allowed to take hold on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaya Electronica companies.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation of the "Green City") received its name according to the wooded hilly landscape in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be sufficiently prepared.
For project supporters, this is simply the "new heart of Europe."
S21 is more than a train station launch, more than a monstrous structure that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate building chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks that ended up in the city center were then considered to be 19th-century traffic-technical fossils, which act as brakes for modern rail transport, because it took enormously much time to rear-end locomotives.
Pull over, stop for a while, move on - that's how it should work.
And that's why head stations are disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the railway station, which lies about halfway through the trans-European railway masterals between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that is why the slogan about "the heart of Europe" is.
It really starts with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities the start of the construction is almost unfinanceable.
Since there have been modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, head stations have no more trouble driving and leaving.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new track ICE to Ulm.
It was pushed through by the country and local politicians.
The routes cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
There will be a new urban space, which - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain many greenery.
For the railway transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The railway station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
But modern transport policy must primarily be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road trucks.
But the new track isn't suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
More importantly, the S21 indirectly affects a lot of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that the next decade will lack funding for other nodal points and tight spots in the network.
There are 60 larger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been building on this route at a slow pace.
You'd have to push harder here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The route of the Rhine Valley will become the throat of the bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government is examining the airport judgment
The Earth Government has left the Wiesbaden Assembly open if it goes against the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court (VGH) concerning the ban on night flights and has it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition commissioned experts to legally assess more than 400-page VGH judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel has now given written reasons that the State would have to re-adapt the night flight ban in the event of construction of the planned Northwest runway of Frankfurt airport.
The permission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the Earth government assumes, does not correspond to the law ordered to protect the population from night air noise.
The Coalition must decide by 4 January if it will require revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and reached government representatives to waive the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel has called on CDU and FDP to return to the promises about the ban on night flights she made before the election. Otherwise, it can be evaluated as a "breach of the word".
It's bloody hard if you can keep your word, said the head of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in the innuendo of the FDP electoral slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's complaint, the government of the country is trying to get to its night flights through the "transformation of law and tricks."
Exact legal control needs its time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on a "fast first impression" basis.
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The statements of his faction to ban night flights have never been as submitted by the opposition.
American banks pay off aid
America's crisis-shaked big bank is getting rid of state handcuffs.
At the same time, the Bank of America repaid assistance from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund of a total of $45 billion (around €30 billion).
According to a report by the US CNBC, Citigroup also plans to repay state aid.
The Constitution thus wants to get rid of the restrictions that have been imposed by the adoption of money - the limitation of payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America provided well $19 billion of clean money for investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the money from her cashier, which was filled, among other things, with trade union sales.
The head of Kenneth Lewis Bank specifically thanked the US taxpayer on Wednesday evening: Money injection helped us to overcome difficult times.
The monetary institution hurt itself at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the State by providing money on the capital market.
With reference to resources, CNBC informed itself that this US bank could have already announced a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesperson didn't want to comment.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid their aid.
Quick Choice
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after the ZDF Board expelled editor Nikolaus Bender from the office.
Last night, the Gremium wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, the head of the ZDF studio in the capital city of Berlin, was the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially, so it wouldn't get ahead of the process.
But the role could also be played by not wanting to damage the intendent of the ZDF Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass at the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine out of 14 grémia members.
The result of the vote was unknown before the deadline for this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter crashed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Bender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although expected.
The majority on the board of directors signaled several weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief with the argument that the ZDF reporting quotas had fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticised.
In fact, 35 state lawyers, who regard Koch's approach as unconstitutional, have recently been involved in the debate.
It was no use.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romanticism.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 went to Frey's ZDF, first to "heute-journal."
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal official of editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of ZDF; since then head of main studio ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected as Media Magazine journalist of the year on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's anti-candidate on the Board of Directors, Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the staffing proposals of the intendant could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, guided the board by a clever chess move - immediately after Brender was deposed, criticized for this by a strong grémium.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing face, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party was pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is anyway ranked with left-wing liberals.
Study gets rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strike, the Ministers of Culture finally went to the federal states on Thursday: At the conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, both parties agreed that it was the will to improve the study conditions for Bachelors and Masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test load: Basically, each study module should be terminated with one single test.
In addition, the student's workload should be rechecked and the "real and defendable rate" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal States undertake to create a more flexible common structural assignment for Bachelor's and Master's studies.
The Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the launch of student protests in the worm, ministers of culture and university rectators have had winged words about better study.
Now they're filled with specific content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation board has agreed that the number of examinations will be reduced in part drastically: "Each module will normally be completed only once by the test," says the 30-page report, which is intended to regulate the approval of the study fields in part.
"Accrediting Board Chairman Reinhold Grimm," said the "disabled development, which significantly reduces the intensity of study," is to be stopped.
For this purpose, the "study burden' in the future is to be the "decisive criterion' in implementation.
Modules and contents must be "to check hard" so that "to limit students when choosing
seminars'.
Students should "enlist for an area that allows and supports their own initiative'.
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, after examination but also for existing fields of study.
These need to be "reaccredited" every five years - but that means it will take until 2015 to check all study fields.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, subject to accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the Federal Republic of Germany to act on the agencies so that the content of the curriculum was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In each of the Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the Landesbanks on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate has promised additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
Of the money, universities should mainly cover consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
For this, countries and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the Parliament of the Higher Education Act.
According to her, only one test should be needed to complete the study module.
Forming a study should be even more flexible, to be guaranteed recognition of exams from other universities and to facilitate access to a master.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all study fields in the country should be checked.
On Thursday, the government and opposition were arguing again about study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called for the creation of education policy not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
No later than after the strike, students as concerned should "speak at least a word into it."
The future academics also received support from the President of the Higher Education Rectors Conference (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelová: "We need student experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom HRK consulted on the joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They require legal claim that would allow every graduate with a bachelor's degree access to a master's degree.
Secondly, the Land must ensure that there are enough places available for today's generation of Bachelor's Degrees in Master's Degrees with the best possible study conditions, said GEW member of the Board of Directors Andreas Keller.
The federal countries must employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to the Master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting into and out of Germany is nice, almost no control..." reads the opening line of one poem by poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn-out piece of language is theorizing the experience of traveling one dissident who has gained freedom but also lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of a children's book publishing house, 1982 then relocated to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was honoured by various literary prizes, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesen Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he took care of a considerable non-literary upheaval at a seminar in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and broken mirror of its security act."
Apparently unsure and perplexed Söllner left a statement in which he admits to his cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Securitate in front of fellow writers of Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit started inconspicuously, at first in 1971.
I, continued Söllner, "that is, someone who did not resist enough attempts at intimidation by Securitate."
Poet Werner Söllner is Secret Agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary settlement with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that identifies the depths and infamousness of the political system that is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said from the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In the Security Act, Secret Agent Walter played a role, said Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to a positive influence on himself as Secret Agent Walter.
"Hacking me up" at all times for him, says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make that remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but the absolutely surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own act, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for Securitate spies.
The people concerned can be expected to speculate and in some cases probably know which name lies behind the code name of Sorin, Voic, and also Walter.
Other than in the domestic, in the meantime, a very certain inspection of the Stazi components is the manipulation of the estate of the securityate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been undermined and restricted.
One of Birthler's authorities, which corresponds to the National Security Council (CNSAS), was only established in 1999, the issue of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that governs the administration of the files.
After the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller's publication, former Security members still have a strong influence in Romania, he demonstrated an interview in which one of the former Head of Security from Timeshvár commented on the winner of the award in denial.
She's got psychosis, after all, she's only been questioned once.
The humiliation of power was expressed here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the inevitable questions are linked to the Söllner case, as in the context of the nondisclosed error.
Who's hurt? The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession expects the continuation of this chapter to be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than the admission of guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturated Deposit Champions League
It seemed like a purely dressed salesman from a cute Christmas party at which the sports goods producer was handing out sweets when he entered a mercedes class C 15 minutes after midnight, a new coach VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by an orange-colored bag of sponsors.
A man with marked baldness was driven by another man's town because of him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and a 55 - year - old man was also drunk with happiness.
It's been a nice evening, but we're gonna keep working tomorrow.
Or it's just about to start.
In the words of only three days of engaged Swiss: "We have reached the eight-finals" in Champions League thanks to the win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against descent."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mainz even on an ordinary league day.
And to avoid renewed weaknesses after three fast goals of Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11.).
Locking
The 8th Champions League Finals (the 16th/17th + 23rd/24th February/rematch 9th/10th + 16th/17th March) will be drawn on December 18th in Nyon.
Thus, the joy of Babbel's successor's startling start will be preserved.
Not only with the supposed healer, who has given insecure Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to deploy and to enjoy the game within a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths and I urged them to be bolder, explained the soul healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not prove effective under the influence of the therapist Babbel.
He stirs up some magic, confesses Babbel's adherent Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you don't think are possible. "
And Sami Khedira, who after a long-week break caused by injury, became the best player on the field because of his dynamics, tried to describe the identified "phenomenon" by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new supervisor's working methods: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
It was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, even players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after the slaughter of 0:4 in Leverkusen, Khedira ponders.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded us that although one goal has been achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not clear yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home win after three months was caused by weekend events that freshly came to life in the form of a television interview with goalie Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that are made by others and not by Jens, Heldt answered the hard Lehmann criticism.
He was throwing weak leadership to the board and decided to change the coach after the pressure of teenage fans.
Even the fact that his free day after the matches was cancelled, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism, " replied Heldt and announced a convention for goalkeepers.
Both 40s probably won't have any more joy in life.
Anyway, they're in agreement with the others that without the work of the deposed coaching team, it wouldn't be possible to play such a strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of success," they say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
Heavyweight World Cup duel
The passionate duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard laps, Ukrainians defended their title in heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The referee's statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains the world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night with one voice at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
It is the third successful defence of the title after his return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC organizations.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the one everyone was expecting.
Klitschko improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice because of injuries he was defeated.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th duel.
Before about 17.000 spectators in the Bern Arena drove 2.02 meters high Klitčko duel mainly with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Klitschko's era before the duel, withdrew before the strikes of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In total, passive Johnson did little to challenge the challenger and only tried to get to the next round.
Although the doorknob provoked with words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
But still, he's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko for twelve rounds.
Before the duel, the challenger made a fuss in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko like a "dirty zombie" who "doesn't know anything properly."
During the weighing on Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled the sunglasses off Johnson's nose, "so he could see his eyes."
The Fourth Victory After Klitschko's Return
Klitčko remained undefeated after the fourth duel after his return on 11 October 2008.
After nearly four years of break, he defeated Samuel Peter, Nigerian in Berlin, and took back his "wbc" belt, which he had to surrender before without a fight.
In this year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreol from the USA.
In this duel, I only got one shot and physically in good shape, justified Klitčko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF organizations.
But the WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye, after he dethroned 2.13 metres high Nikolai Vulayev in November.
Haye canceled a fight this summer against Klitschko, who was scheduled for September.
Supposedly, his promoter company is planning a fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
Case of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: The chief of the Greens Jürgen Trittin called Kundúz Minister of Defense a liar because of bad information about the Kundúz affair.
SPD and Linke (Leave) invite the Chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on the Kundúz air raid, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed conscious deception.
In September, the minister said "untruely" to the death bombing of two cisterns, said the head of the Green faction Jürgen Trittin on Saturday's ARD "Tagesschau" news show.
Let's call it the usual term: "He lied."
The order to kill was issued in violation of the International Security Support Force rules in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report that NATO read, Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US air raid demanded by the German commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, a NATO investigation of up to 142 people were killed or injured.
On Saturday, the Greens, SPD, and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to express herself immediately before the Federal Assembly and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Federal Assembly's Afghan policy - and whether the Office of Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service approved this new strategy, they called on Jürgen Trittin and a colleague of the Greens Renate Künast.
Ulrich Wilhelm, a spokesperson for the government, has certainly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor's Office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, too, doubts were raised about the Ministry's presentation of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary-General Peter Wichert.
According to Spiegel's information, both Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially, it was said that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and hide sensitive details from the Minister.
However, it was said from the vicinity of the two top officials that they even pointed out a number of reports from the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein's commanding officer and a report from the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had in the meantime asked in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that no reply has yet been received.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the complaints and pointed out that this will be dealt with in the Committee of Investigation of the Federal Assembly, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images awake and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only mentally ill or drug-induced, the boundaries between imagination and reality come together.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and fantasies.
But in today's Western world, those who experience the alertness of dream conditions see and hear things that others do not see and hear, usually pay as a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in mentally ill or in drug abuse.
The blame is our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels make sure that there are lines between dream, imagination and reality.
Dreams of altered state of consciousness may occur in various forms, in a better case we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initial and effect may vary, however, the vision of the Hildegard von Bingen mystery, the drug experiences of the Prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, shaman states of deliriousness, psychosis and hallucination can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and interactions between different parts of the brain are disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has employed philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of awake dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great resemblance to dreaming with dream states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions, delusions of senses."
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and brilliantly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, hovering at the ceiling of the room.
They feel kicked.
Behind him winged devil figures with bloody red Grimas, priced teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fire boots, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, bad voices threaten from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the voices they call him names and insults.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, locks them in a loop and puts it on a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
Loop's loose.
Learn how to shout the chorus' voices tearing his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD has been started.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoid psychosis, plus he's manic-depressive, taking antidepressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
Phantoms are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, disability is usually no longer able to distinguish the inner and outer world, and they get into a reawakened state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions, or illusions of persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Optical hallucinations aren't uncommon either.
The sufferer is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is concentrated on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is located in the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time it gets into a passive role, it becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
A comparison with reality is not usually possible with them, the ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucination
Other than in a dream, Fuchss says, "but the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved. "
Misguided thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real context.
The scientist is still in front of a riddle about why exactly our brains are doing this sort of rip-off.
Each person's exceptional circumstances may lead to a short-term loss of relationship with reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early development will cause damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, such as the mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a riddle of how the neuronal system malfunctions, which has not been shown in any way for many years.
The role also plays the influences of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be the instigator of psychosis if it is available.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor Psychology Erich Kasten of Ljubljana.
Whether we view delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are typical underlying phenomena of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychic disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or cerebral trauma are also common.
Surprisingly, he hallucinates even the brain of a healthy person under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of content of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or not suppressed; if our brain is boiled or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worry about love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of the respondents reported that they had had a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Front Pomerania and goes to the local high school.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If there weren't those patterns and voices.
On breaks, she may be able to reach out to her with long, dark hair.
When he answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one sees or hears except her.
This shy girl sees an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows that.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy?, he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions aren't real and will disappear again.
At night, appearances are rather depressing.
Often delusions are a burden.
When he sits in the classroom, he cannot watch the lessons many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the board of mathematical equations.
At night, appearances are rather depressing.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he often cannot tell whether he is awake or whether he is asleep, whether the images he sees, the Grimas, or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her hands and legs are created in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted a psychologist named Kasten on the Internet, she knows she hasn't gone crazy.
Phantoms are also art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or stimulated, they will most likely hallucinate, says Kasten.
I guess the brain doesn't have enough work to take care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid as a little girl of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations started when she found out at 13 that the man she called her dad since she thought herself wasn't her own father.
Because for visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas are active, which also process real sensations and sounds, it is difficult for the disabled like Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality. "Every experience" says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, also reality is displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to develop, which is why they act so really."
Also, Kasten evaluates night dreams as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border condition between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological in our world, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at Florence-Nightingale Hospital Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the concerned person considers to be real and cannot distinguish them from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis when fully conscious.
When a person is at risk of losing the world and himself, like a lasting, complete inability to move, he replaces the life threatening the real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of border state between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to cope with a situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will become present in the imagination.
Intense form of sensory support and sensory transfer in some unbearable situation that allows us people to have our own ability to form, to move within an instant into loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Changing the Heart) as a rescue of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after the heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness set out on a few days' journey, while his body lay motionless in an intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man confined to bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles who produce intoxicating substances from blood.
On a motorcycle, he's kidnapped by a Greek to his homeland, surfed on a hospital bed at a firm in the Alps, and met a Korean mobster.
It immerses itself completely into imaginary happening, everything is real, even later in memories.
These internal paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is different, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental pathways are clearly clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other corrective experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of external reality are, even in a waking state.
Every change in state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.

Burd
At 27 they are to take over publishing children
The new head of Kallen publishing house is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda long-term wishes to hand over his business to his two children, he said to SPIEGEL.
Holding is also to belong to a 100 percent family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the business, says the 69 - year - old man of SPIEGEL.
We discussed the details carefully.
The question whether they are active in the company is asked afterwards.
I wonder if they have the ability to do that.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in charge of their children if they are not sufficiently capable.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burd announced on Thursday that he had withdrawn from the Board of Directors since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burdy since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the branch of Pokladna added responsibility for the company's assets and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also Direct marketing, Foreigner, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "knead 10, 15 years " Burd said.
The holding should also belong to a 100 percent family in the future, says Burda.
In view of Schickedanz and Schaeffler's cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure about extinction: "It has always been affected by companies that have been infected by the desire for capital that they speculated and thought could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," says Burd.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time," these stores are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and that's when it's time to find out what celebrities wear and adapt their gala wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which must be noted.
We are presenting several proposals.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
Endesa Power Company together with Barcelona City Hall established 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
LIVE's office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will determine and manage the travel plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure mobility agreements, will handle, coordinate and submit allowances, etc.
It will also develop the MOMELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
All in all, the purpose is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
These are the three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan Government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a rest period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is in for a "rest period'.
In the economic report of the Prime Minister for 2009, Zapatero summarised the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the competitive plan for the automotive sector, we would be facing a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies," said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected for this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integral Plan for the automotive sector (PIA), identified 800 million for projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies which mobilised an investment exceeding EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also emphasised the government's measures to support the requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which applies in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan allowed for a 6% reduction in the average emission level for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and for a marked increase in the registrations, namely by "40 per cent' in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Salon will be opened in Madrid, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies will be the following:Clasicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumberas, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
External competence tests
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sports performances, fitness tests, presentations and auditions.
The qualification tests for classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Maintaining Sports Style
Mazda intends to show that the environment's gentleness has no negative effect on sports style.
And that's why Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as a stop- which is currently only available with a 2.0 150 horsepower petrol engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent in Mazda3.
Front seats incl. driver seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using the tool and console assembly, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and controls and distinctive red and blue colors.
This style reminds us in part of the style that also presents Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and more specifically with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, a large luggage compartment and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start-up system is available only with a petrol engine for two liters and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although Mazda3's most sought-after version is diesel, all those who do not drive so much kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine because it is characterized by greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
As far as equipment is concerned, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment it is necessary to mention mainly the lane tracking system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, tension control and stability, speed control, internal light sensitive mirror, onboard computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain sensor and lights,bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels made of 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, with an extra charge of EUR 1,500: twoxenon and BOSE audio system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is characterised primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not travel more kilometers per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is €21.770 for Luxury and €23.270 for the tested version - Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, has chosen a dark 'lady'.
Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only used for viewing mail, without the possibility to view certain type of attachments or surf over the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine appreciated it as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see him outside, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for, for example, an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, for which Peek must be paid six times the amount.
FonPeek, introduced yesterday to Le Web, is a European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is limited as much as its American counterpart, but it brings surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or Fon connection) so they can view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for roaming tariffs to be reduced so as to be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device like FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon if it doesn't have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and considering various offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offers downloading books and further searching on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid for when purchased, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to see in the FonPeek case, it's a possibility to buy with a permanent approach like this Peek has already been introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type of consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on the computer.
The Color Michelle Loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to become President of the United States, she chose a dress and coat in this color, and she chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to the fact that it is a similar colour - yellow green with glittering effects - in both cases it was a three-piece complete - dress, bag and coat made of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of taking up office Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium-high heel, now similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears different hairstyles: this time a chisel, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternity-related work problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the 'Fertility and Work Career of Spanish Women' study conducted by the CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged between 15 and 75 years, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to motherhood.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in opinion on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, as well as on the type of employment.
Women who do not work away from home, work part-time, or have a stable job, start living with their partner sooner, have a first child before, and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have the first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted more of their lives to achieving their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone their cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the time of starting cohabitation with a partner" explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and birth of offspring is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child aged 25,1 or 32,1 respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with primary education are getting married and giving birth to the first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or high education prefer to obtain stable employment, rather than marrying and having the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal motto 'Cause I'm worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, joins other famous personalities of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penelope Cruz.
Before she joined this selected club of actress Evangeline Lilly ('Lost ') and Freida Pinto ('The Millionaire of the Shack').
The men's part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelina's partner in 'The Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to talk about in fashion matters.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and present - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court os Justice.
Nobody missed a meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicent gives 30 X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in his normal life).
It does not do so in dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vincent doesn't save the scars or the inspiration.
This book is an excellent readership, even at repeated readings.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the enjoyment of the promontory, the morale without guilt and innocence without any god. "
About Samuel Beckett: "A Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him. "
About Graham Green: "Our man has been given a passion for this woman for 13 years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven in the way of damnation. "
About James Joyce: "This Odysseus was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that has to be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall. "
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
On his own, he said he was the heir to a landlord from the county, sometimes he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases they were great dreams."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured this man's crazy cry from Munich on the bridge to carry his echo into the night of the XXth century in his literary form, fleeing from himself and calling for the future and speaking sharply to worms. "
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: 'My God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After the effort comes a dream,/ after the storm of a quiet port,/after the war rest,/after the full life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also carried his depression.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII followed her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos have to do but point Joyce at Baroja?
What else was Benet's business but having Baroja execute Faulkner's weapon?
What else was Cel's purpose but to make himself famous at the expense of the man's glory?"
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my 70 - year - old mother passed through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by and our dog, a hybrid rescued from a shelter with a maximum weight of six kilograms, was kicked twice and badly injured without a word.
Our outrage is all the more so that we don't see anything funny in such an aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the leash.
In addition, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she met these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, for such a devil-obsessed person who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, child, old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we filed a complaint against the nearest police department, but we doubt that it was of any use, and in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
The outrage made us announce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to today's youth when they're talking about a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We don't understand what happened to proper manners, respect for animals and humans.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both of these entities have informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using a helmet, as it is the only means to prevent head injuries or death in the event of an accident on a motorcycle.
Michelin notes that this campaign forms part of their transport safety commitments, which "means more than design and manufacture even safer products" and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets while riding a motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', is the first stage when up to more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be placed signs to get to the awareness of the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety is "a constant problem' to this company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increased
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and what is more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to the figures of the patronage organization of the producers Anfac and Ganvam retailers.
However, a favourable figure is better to be quarantined, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and represents a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger cars derivatives, pick-up cars, vans, small trucks and light trucks/bogies.
And neither did the grimies that most harm demand, even though they were purchased by private individuals, most purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and almost 100% of the cases involved funding through third parties.
Other factors such as cessation of activity or continuation of poor economic situation need to be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the bank loan source.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the promotion of the purchase of 2000E did not help very much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention persons engaged in a small and medium-sized company trade certificate who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, they reminded Ganvam that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The dealer association assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to calculations sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with ESP stability control, with manual brake systems, all of this will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while others are set a deadline for eliminating the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, working in such a way that they can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system finds after the driver steps down.
But it doesn't always hold that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers in the accident did not press the brake before the collision and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatal accidents per year could be avoided.
Reduction of this number will be even more marked-based calculations would prevent one of the four accidents with an impact on the person-after the introduction of so-called smart handbrake systems.
In this case, vehicles shall be equipped with a system that (with radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably on April 8th - as Javier Ortega informed the American manufacturer, points out that it will need more time to implement the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every item of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
On the contrary, GM assures that the decision on the sale of Saab should be taken these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American producer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to get the Volvo, but he is considering the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer, Skyper, who operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement could be reached with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to Baic.
The decision to close the Saab at the end of the year will continue to apply if its sale fails.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, the Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus the weight shows only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of this, in the first place, the automatic downloading roof is in canvas with manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; further, aluminium doors such as GT3 were used, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reduction of fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to the weight reduction by another 7 kg; after fitting the sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to lightweight 19-inch wheels for another five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-clutch gearbox PDK, one vehicle was tested with a hand-ordered six-speed box, mainly on the roads of the second class in California, on the mountain sections with many complicated corners.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not printed on asphalt.
On the contrary, we have not tested such a small and light model for a long time, which would also transmit such safety when moving in turns, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete able to warm up the muscles during a short ride for the necessary time until we order him to sprint, brake, and restore the use of the engine...
Anything we want, thanks to a steering wheel that's as communicative as accurate, whatever we put our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound by will
The sound of the V6 boxer, by 320 horsepower (by 10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced by the possibility of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recovery.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
Asphalt of the roads we're driving through with Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; yet in some corners we encountered frost and gravel at dawn even in an advanced morning.
Definitely this ultralighter car is one of the most fun on the market, as it is a little more than a mere modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70.831.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, Coco Cocoon icon and the occasional 'starlette' at the company shows, the singer shows her face to the evil girl as vehemently as Chanel's purses.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia has won a victory in Israel
The working cash register gained a brilliant victory in 82-91 when hosting on the complicated playground Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences in the team Duska Ivanovice, and thus came to the forehead of its group after a big performance by Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29 reviews).
Vitoria's team was able to replace Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic's considerable amount of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end in order to win.
In addition, the great accuracy of the 16 triple points circuit was much involved in the final triumph.
The match began face-to-face for the blue team, who had stood on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, which suggested that they attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovice were among the main shooters of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava squad decided for the internal game Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, which was accepted by whistling and applause when returning to its original assignment to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovice was already beginning to act as the best in its 13-point team, although 'without six' in the evaluation of Splitter it already indicated that this would not be the best night for Brazilians.
But even though the game was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that on their playground not everyone wins, and 'the hand of Elías' managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the return of the 'yellow' to the sun (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to catch their breath, and then appeared the machine gun Mirza Teletovice, which three triples almost in a row and with the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a soothing number (54-67), which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs have skinned themselves in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not be allowed to be deprived of the results of the first 30 minutes.
However Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the squad alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter voted out for the foul seIvanovic did not hasten and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
The wounds make Unicaya impossible to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the leadership of Group B in Euroliga in the match, which was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly by the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagan team was not frightened by the environment of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or rival, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubius, lit up the playground with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympicos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaya , although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis , Vujcice and Schortsanitis , turned the score 22-20 , minute 13 , which was the moment when the fight between US support from Beverley and Williams meant the elimination of both players.
The Greek cooperative began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jimenez burdened the Unicaya cooperative
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing of Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Rematch
The third part was very offensive from the side of Olympiacos, which, despite losing by 19, proved superior and even managed to offset the difference from the game in Malaga Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to management and triple points Cook and contribution Lewis left a certain hope n winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because the Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and superiority in centimeters in its zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to level out the bassket range 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja slid and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you collect for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit application, search engines with the largest number of classified adverts in real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool How much should you take? calculates the salaries of users on the basis of more than 140 000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where the profession, years of experience, age and city where the candidate wishes to work.
During the week that the application works, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally "feel poorly rewarded" explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the Trovit product.
According to data available to Trovit from his search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes EUR 45.226 gross per year and French 31.059, while the Spaniard receives EUR 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of EUR 34.247 net annually in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the work of a waiter with EUR 11.592 is the worst paid in Spain, followed by a salesman with EUR 14.725 and a worker with EUR 15.667.
The most wanted jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil set the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelay's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office shall leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in Honduran capital, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January after the end of his mandate and seek another refuge'.
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the election of 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which the government "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti tried to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood on the markets, uncertainty has reappeared on the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment where managers take decisions about the future, which in itself is uncertain.
The treatment used by central banks to stabilise the market was the debt monetization by direct purchase of assets and indirect release of liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets to deduct.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand into gearing, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we participate in the return of a reduction in risky returns.
The volatility of the stock exchange and the differences of bonds by the companies regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risks, which once again affected public debt.
Again, the US, Japan, and Germany have become a refuge for the chosen investors, thereby extending the distinction between euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction in the qualifications of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless for the silence of moral-risk advocates who have again tried to burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy in order to stop the devastating consequences of reducing credit to employment when, in fact, a new Thanksgiving day would have to be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, elections, and a new government is starting.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro Member State not to fulfil its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is for Ecofin to force the Greek Government to transparency and commitment of its own citizens to joint responsibility in the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the transitional risk premium normalization period, after some excesses in supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differences will increase as much as European companies' bonds, we need not worry.
If Europe's differences are reduced and ours continue to expand, this would typically be a Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 growth scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not give the Spanish economy much hope of living up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "carefully, my friend the driver."

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene in front of the sub-Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategies are under discussion in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by President Gas Natural-Fenosus, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made several remarks to the press regarding the proposal he submitted to the sub-mission behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another 60,000 million from this date to 2030 if nuclear power plants currently operating are maintained.
If this did not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
Since 2020, the question has changed and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for a new 18,000 MW, but with other "supported energies'.
Galán, who believes that the proposal for a law on a sustainable economy, which has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line demanded by the company, did not want to bleed as a royal decree in support of the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "accurate" measures, as President Iberdrol called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start now, because their ripening takes place and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for airport land services, Swiss Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of preferential partner of the Irish airlines Aer Lingus for cargo services at 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement from which economic terms have not yet flowed has been valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation on the creation of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures yesterday.
The association envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which is Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona strives for her first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concession on the highway in Australia, a market where she already works as an energy and water business.
The construction involved is a tunnel estimated at $1,700 million in Australia (about EUR 1.047 million).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
A tunnel 5 km long in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for Acciona to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway business.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel completed at the end of 2014
Following the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initial in English) for further development of the project in the business plan supported by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of tolls.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, and the projected investment will reach $1,700 million (EUR 1.047 million) and, at the last stage, three companies with significant presence in European constructions are competing.
A group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest specialists in underground construction.
Against Acciona is in the Northern Direct Group with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which passed through the network, is called LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (the daughter of the German construction company Hochtief, represented by the ACS), also the local Baulderstone (the owner of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and an important company specializing in the civil construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatisations, but it carries a clear difficulty of entry in a way other than the acquisition of a local construction company.
In addition to Asian references, the strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Million-dollar assets
Acciona is betting on a geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and manage the desalination plant in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground road subject to a toll, the promoter of which is the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link (northern link), is to connect the West Highway from Toowoong with the Kelvin Grove tour route (see map) in the length of 5 kilometers of the tunnel. This is the biggest event for reducing traffic congestion Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to be awarded for the summer of 2010 and the start of the work for December next year.
Although this paid transit would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to project in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still making significant profits because yesterday it announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
Share ACS will operate through its local Leighton network infrastructure with fiber optic cable.
This situation will allow fast Internet access to 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the design of the King George tower on 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. The construction work was just about to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
The FCC was assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine filial, received an allocation of EUR 64.5 million of a 2.1 km tunnel for the motorway in Slovenia.
The company obtained a contract several days after the work was carried out to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services over the last two years to Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of €3 million a year, informed the railway company.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agencies, which presented themselves in the audition published by Renfe, from which to the finals advanced four, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating ads for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of campaign design and production.
Fine 63 million forFrance Télécom for braking competition
The competition regulatory authority in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition between fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers at the edge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still the state company have bought more than EUR 560 million of fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to their competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a relapse.
Application business
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an app shop on the Internet in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app business will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries like Spain.
Playing in the League Champions brought from the beginning 476,4 million Madrid and Barçe
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476,4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn't just bring glory. It's also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided EUR 5.362,5 million into 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) participating since the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he earned for participating, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won three main prizes.
Catalan current champion and the last winner of the lost Cup of Europe in 1992 is in the fifth classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two cooperatives who also charged the most money to participate in the last Champions League.
Even though she lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country that has won the most money through the Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by a complex process in the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, Michel Platini is planning to make $1.90 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA spends 413,1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have reached their participation have received 3.8 million only for their presence, with the exception of an additional EUR 550,000 for each match they participate in.
There is also a prize premium (EUR 800,000) and a draw (EUR 400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter finalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion earns $9 million while the second finalist makes $5.2 million.
In this way, the club earns a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments to which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned seats.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the allocated money, second 30%, third 20% and fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published yesterday details of the offer to purchase shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not oblige a public offer to acquire (option) all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share that it would pay at the age of ten and for which it would pay interest for this deferral of 1% per year.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended trading at EUR 1.85; thus, Nueva Rumasa's bid is rated by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer shall be subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
The CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would have reached 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to change the structure of his leadership.
As an attempt to remain on the outskirts of possible offers for purchase and settlement of judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, was announced the election of María Luisa Jordan as head of internal audit.
This decision makes it the first woman to take up a high position in a food business.
It's a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company continues to be immersed in the legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos of Salazar Brothers.
De facto it cannot be shredded the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new transfers of funds
With regard to Salazar's credit, former members of the Council of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaya representatives) testified yesterday at the National Court and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows the option to exclude Paternina who participated in Inversor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion of Inversor Mer from Federic Paternin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorised this operation as it understood that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considered that the "sufficient' content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the adaptations introduced on 2 December is sufficient.
CNMV stated that the offer was directed at obtaining 550.008 shares in Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8,95% of the company's capital, which consists of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbau stock exchanges.
It further explained that 5.592.778 million shares could not be transferred in any way until an offer was concluded specifying that the price was fixed by Federice Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New instruments for the valuation of cars
These days, storms and accidents not only make car service.
Each day thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are towed into the service where the expert has to estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of the workforce can be long and complex work.
It may take two or three hours to calculate manually the cost of repairing from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labor.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Service suppliers and solutions for the estimation of insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audatex, from the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is done with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation tools and developing sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's sales director, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers, each providing information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is still increasing as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been reported in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
It is a very feverish job because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle has to be catalogued and its price determined.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "pierce" individual parts of tourist cars.
When it comes to a model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As far as a minority car is concerned, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99,2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
They're over 99% of the fleet in circulation.
To do the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each one specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normal mechanics experts) work together with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in developing these databases.
Every month 2,5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information enables businesses to make different use and provision of different products.
The most common use is focused on repair and maintenance, but by country there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company with a guide to inform about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get the support that professionals in the sector can use.
This enterprise offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, a standard solution for the valuation of insurance events intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is paid according to use for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows to disable vehicles with a total insured event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying the tendency, carrying out geodegraphic analyses or detecting deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of specific brands have been serviced due to an accident or how many serious insurance events have suffered over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of instrument.
It also sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group established in 1971 as a service supplier and solution for damage assessment, accident or car maintenance
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in service, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and charged EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization started by installing an office in Paris.
Audatex was established in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources 62% of her brother is created in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The world billing of Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group stood at $1,000 million on the stock market and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation envisaged the subscription of EUR 59.5 million out of 85% of the company's capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This service of valuation and purchase and sale is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, sale of spare parts and professional vendors who have to register before the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
It handles 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been disabled cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Wagons with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been disabled, after an interim procedure.
The budget of the service in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user will receive the budget only in four steps: vehicle identification, spare part search, budget creation and budget generation.
Easy use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, of which the tourist 666, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with internet connection is needed for use.
After identification of the model to be corrected using the chassis number, the real graphical display of the model appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables as the cost of the workforce, extras or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an AudaPlus valuation tool, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is oriented to service and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this workshop tool is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to ensure that these images are three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome because it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it to display the inner side.
