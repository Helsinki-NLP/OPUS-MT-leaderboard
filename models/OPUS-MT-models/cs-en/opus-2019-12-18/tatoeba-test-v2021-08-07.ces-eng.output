According to Tatoeby's guidelines, it is recommended that members simply add sentences in their native language or translate from the language they understand to their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose naturally sounding sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strangely. We ask that you translate the sentence only when you know for sure what it means.
