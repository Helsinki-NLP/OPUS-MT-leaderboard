Parliament did not support the novel liberating Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the proposal to repeal the paragraph under the amendment to the Criminal Code on the basis of which the opposition leader Julia Tymoshenko was convicted.
At the second reading, MEPs rejected an adjustment that would open the way to the liberation of the prisoner's prime minister.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for concluding a allegedly disadvantageous contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final, the appeal sentenced by the court is due to be held in December.
Tymoshenko calls the judgment a political vendetta of the regime, suspicion of bias brought about by the trial in the West.
The proposal that paragraph 365 fall out of the Criminal Code on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted supported 147 Members in the vote.
It took 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has its defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him, the war is over.
It's left to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists win elections, but it is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to Sharia's customary law, and we already have an idea of it.
Libya will become a country free of crime, for theft is the hand cut off.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates of faith await execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we cannot imagine and we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is not the only one, nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the very Libyans for a change.
In fact, it's a wonder that the Islamic warriors took gratitude from unbelievers' dogs.
They are only excused by the fact that, from their point of view, NATO was not driven by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every successful intervention.
Thus, when winners are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in a gunfight, served Islam, and our politicians disposed of a political ally in a dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
That leaves the locals with a problem of expelling "crusaders."
But without the occupation of an oil company, will they have the libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast the selfless protection of human rights.
Unless it interferes with the Sharia law-makers.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe got into the investors' viewfinder
On Tuesday, the statistical storm swept across Europe.
Individual states have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has been stagnating, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is tearing up records today.
Investors are no longer looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic developments for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries modified the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (growth by 0.3% instead of the original 0,1%), but France said that it appeared in a slight drop of 0.1% (the original data referred to stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1.5 percent year on year in Q3 this year.
However, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated quarter-on-quarter and according to ČSÚ confirmed the trend of gradual slowing the growth of economic performance.
The results are worse than the analysts' estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy increased by 1.5 percent year on year in Q3 this year, but stagnating between four years.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy increased by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
The euro area economy and the European Union increased by 0.2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
Greece's economy declined by 5.2 percent year on year.
The yield on her ten-year bonds is 28,45%.
The proceeds of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Problems are beginning to feel also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium etc...
The Czech 10-year bond yields are below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
Germany has voiced that the ECB should be the lender of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and celebrate the 200 million-dollar procedure
Soccer team made it through the toughest challenge of the season!
Petr Jiráček won 1:0 in Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goal.
Czech football with a large portion of happiness in the second half has defended the luxury lead from home retaliation and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progress match in detailed reports.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech representation won happily 1-0 in Černá Hora thanks to its domestic waste at the end, the great Czech and hero Jiráček celebrates the European Championship.
Because of the precise defence of the Czech whole, the Black Mountains did not reach pressure until the second half.
The losers of the match became Damjanovich and Vukinic, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Bohemia so the Czech representation will not miss the European Championship next year.In addition, the prize of about CZK 200 million will come to the Czech football box.
A lot of fighting football has been played since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hard to get involved in the combination and played mostly around a halfway line.
The pressure of domestic footballers also did not come in the first half, because long kicks for defense the Czech defense was precisely averted.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a live shield.
Several hundred college students created a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
By their gesture, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
At noon on Tuesday, students prayed before the facility and then cried out for the death of the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center in which uranium is being processed on Tuesday.
They thus show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran seems to have not stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
There is talk of a possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isphahan nuclear facility and then cried out for the death of America and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in addition to the Isphahani Centre, an installation in Natanz, in which uranium is enriched, would also be targeted in the event of an attack that would as much as possible cripple Iran's nuclear program.
Obese child's menu: does not eat and eat sausages
Over a third of children 9 to 13 years of age have overweight problems, with 9 percent of schoolchildren overweight and 5 percent of children obese.
In most cases, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey has shown.
It shows again how important the environment in which it grows and the patterns in which it is surrounded is for a healthy person's development.
For example, sausages appear half as often on the tables of obese children as they do in the families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with the world event called Obesity is not a coincidence of more than 19 percent obese.
Also, it is not customary for fat people to play sports in families, but most of the families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children replied that their parents would find time to move actively at least once a week.
Survey between 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic attended it.
It was the second year of Obesity is not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
The proper eating and exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically rising number of overweight or even obesity children.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five times a day in breakfast-snack-snack-snack-dinner mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition," one of the results of the survey is.
Without breakfast and evening sausage
Experts point out that relative details, such as regular family breakfast time, are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding out that there's no breakfast at all in a tenth of homes.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more frequently.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly play sports, their parents had less than half - 15 percent.
Build Your Diet
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own menus according to their own taste and opinion.
"Boarding preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of mealy, meaty and sweet dishes.
"In particular, the great popularity of sweet lemonade is alarming," says the final report on the survey.
For lunch as the main dish won pasta just above the poultry.
However, children did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and noon vegetables is low.
A tendency to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In a number of cases, there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition in the survey group of surveyers who completed the questionnaire after the lecture on Obesity is not a coincidence," the results of the project are stated.
Markant was, for example, the sweet lemonade, where more children would prefer ordinary water.
Children have also checked poultry and fish on the questionnaire more frequently as a main meal of the day and would reduce sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, hardcore pros
In an introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was a lot already at the opening class.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three pros in the field, dressing up troublesome characters and a seminar on how it works on the set.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "footed."
This time, me and Director Alice discussed (there is not a single boy in the class) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly compatible figure.
And that's the vast majority.
Somebody has a short neck, somebody has a boy figure without proper curves and somebody gets overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We got tips like Jennifer Lopez's wife, bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist, figure nicely emphasized and at the same time did not dress the woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirt or pants really do not fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece tailored.
You won't regret it, because perfect fitting clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailor-made skirt than in one that constantly moves, rolls up, pulls out in the waist and so on.
A boy figure can again afford to wear clothes with quilting, apps, embroidery or picking up.
Of course, there's a lot of information and character types, so I'm glad I have all week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given the homework you're assigned, that's enough.
Each of the participants was assigned a celebrity to invent two outfits: daily and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the person and the character type.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit of cheering, for me personally certainly better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about 100 kilos (please take into account the exaggeration) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the internet and print them out and then graphically process them.
The Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will then express our personal style and relationship to graphic rendering.
Thinking about the graphics of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates product pages in magazines (for specific purposes, such as trends in purses, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But that's Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture was filled with information about the types of characters groomed by three guests in the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
The variability is crucial in this case.
For example, a trenchcoat (or if you want trenchcoat) can be worn classicly through jeans and shirts like a cloak, but you can dress it on a bare body, put on shoes and take pictures like a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for a job. "
"Then you can start breaking them," said James.
So I can finally see why we're smashing up all these lessons, what to combine, why, even in fashion magazines, sometimes we see something else.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist must have a lot more dress options than he can take pictures of.
So in a fashion story that has ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "covert" at least fifteen.
And it also looks and works in combination with other pieces, sometimes quite different from the actual picture.
That's what we have to count on when we're outfitting.
That the image and style is sometimes up to half the success, was confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylist services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look in it is secondary).
And if somebody already gets styling from us, then we're supposed to assume that it's very likely to dictate a completely different (smaller) size than it really is.
Then all we have to do is google and see if the tabloids reported that the celebrity had lost weight/loss and so on.
On Sunday both Honza and Mario put on our hearts that stylist is not enough to navigate fashion and to be able to assemble outfits.
In his work, he communicates primarily with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to submit, to stand up for your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to sort her closet and fill it in with nice pieces, you can't throw out her entire closet and say, oh, my God, that's horrible."
"Find at least a few things you praise and recommend what you can wear," Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "placed", or set bag, must contain.
It's the one you turn on around your waist and you have all the necessary propriety on you.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair rollers or safety pins, there are also nylon threads (with which the stylist helps himself to take pictures of products such as purses or hats), special clips with which we close the back of the clothes, if it is larger (pinner or other clamp is not permitted, would damage the garment), or sewing kit.
In order not only to listen, but also to practically try something, we learned how to properly succumb to shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio with a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch shoes with scissors so they don't happen to be damaged.
So real skill is needed.
Mario delighted me when he commended my creation without reservation.
I mean, the skills mentioned aren't really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we listened to on the second weekend of the course.
It's becoming more and more clear to me that it's really not a walk in the park, no matter who says what they want to do.
In Need for Speed: The Run races across America.
Reviews
Originally a carefree ride turns into a routine morning shift due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
Although the ambition was largely achieved, it is not valid when no one apparently wanted to do anything else.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run woke up before the release of high expectations.
He promised that the years of the Need for Speed racing series would move again a bit in a new direction, and from playable demonstrations he appeared as a game that would not be in the genre of action racing only to number.
We were also curious about how the inserted passages will turn out, in which the main hero gets out of the car and takes place in his own way.
But, as the NFS series tends to be, many are in turn a little different from what we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole drags down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series for more or less several years.
So it's not really a mistake, but rather an incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main hero Jack has certain problems of a personal nature and as a solution he offers to participate in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your job is to arrive first in New York.
The idea carries some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One doesn't feel like the game is always the same.
Some of the environments are also very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-class.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seems visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are made from time to time by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be covered in an avalanche.
In addition, individual races are quite well placed behind each other.
There are only a few types, but it's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (the basically classic race), then you catch up with time (classical fight with stopwatch) and then you have a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, police will also get involved, which makes your efforts even more unpleasant.
The novelty is the passages outside the car.
It's more like an interactive animation where Jack is mostly fleeing from someone, and you have to help him do it by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
It's nothing complicated.
It surprises, however, that these passages are much less in play than you would expect (perhaps even three).
In the end, however, it is for the benefit of the matter, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and thus, in the context of the above mentioned, it ranks among the elements that make the game better.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is definitely not who knows what nowadays, but it is not to be said that it is a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the action-based racing of the local driving model still works quite well, even though we could find a better one in competition.
So far, everything is perfectly fine.
However, problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the model, the collision model is no longer in order.
We don't expect this type of game to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but when virtually no impact on any object you have any idea how your car will behave, then perhaps everything is not quite right.
Typically, when you cross or pass cars in normal traffic, sometimes you just lightly lick each other, but sometimes in an almost identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even smash right in.
The rebooting system doesn't really matter, but it's gonna make you feel really upset.
Reboots are designed so that if you smash or go far off track, the game will throw you back to the last clue point on the track.
But only five reboots are available in each race.
When you're exhausted, you have to start the race all over again.
So it's more of a tool in case something goes wrong than you can rely on them explicitly.
But sometimes reboots don't help, they solve them only when they have to learn a given section of the race by heart.
The big problem of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply can't fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly upsetting in situations where you can see how between the two opposite cars the opponent will easily pass in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them because it's "counted" so that the situation always happens just before your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
During the whole time playing you will find several places where you, no matter the time again, always overtake the same opponent in the same place.
It hits most at the end of the game on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to get there in front of you at all costs, apparently.
When he's ahead of you, he's making it harder for you to see the cars going against you, so at first, you're probably going to smash around a couple of times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-y, but the design is so obvious that it will reliably disgust you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes even so action that sometimes you literally can't watch where you fly.
And it doesn't really matter whether the concept of 50 unique tracks, races so that boredom doesn't stand a chance or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas stations at the roads, because that's where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you can handle what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars on straight highways and exotic supersports on technical rides, such as winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the mode of challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common to both challenges and stories.
Different objects are unlocked for higher levels of the driver: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also connected again with the Autolog online feature, which inter alia compares your achieved results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard to understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you can get to the subway tunnel (either) where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (so be it).
The speedometer flashes numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (either) and the subway set comes from behind and uncompromisingly scrapes you off.
In the newsroom, we will probably have a few more days to discuss whether no one really thought about making the game, or whether the authors think we are really such big jerks.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in several cases even great.
It is so saddened that in some of the more intense moments the scans fall, and in some cases it is quite tragic.
However, this is mainly about car crashes with more participants, where you would no longer be able to get a smooth shot.
The soundtrack is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of younger audiences, soundtrack from the category "every dog in a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music someone will probably not buy the game.
The overall impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run has been the best piece of NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game is unfinished.
I'm sure it's fun, but get ready for your mistakes to smash into your eyes with airport spotlights.

Ambassador to EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has seriously undermined the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation settles a bit, calms down and before all players get used to their new roles," the Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
As much as she takes her motto "Intelligibly and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed the first part of the lecture when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the UK could envy her.
Vicen also commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was a criticism that it was bland, that it was a grey official, that it couldn't play any part, and I must say that everyone was breathed out, that it was a great role."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: "Who is this European Union? Which telephone number should I call?" - an important step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards countries like China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from raw cheese.
Vicena has also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and lives in the near future.
The Pre-London Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs dealt with the upcoming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The government's fall at this time was then described as a large negative, which damaged the Czech Republic very badly.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the 'fact frmol' was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being addressed today.
Moreover, a new seven-year budget of the Union still needs to be approved, which is what makes the current economic situation very difficult.
Whether the budget will be slim and austerity, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and less, this is all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also reminded her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: 'A Europe intelligible'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, hanky, no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that they really do not invent curved or round pickles in Brussels, bananas of different sizes or that we really must be banned from raw materials."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and to get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe ahead of us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice the negatives rather than the positives of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
She blames many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me that when Polish and Hungarian come to me and the Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what's going on in there, what's up with your Visegrad Four?" and he doesn't look so excited about it."
In the future, the Union, according to Vicene, is mainly waiting for new hard rules for Member States' budgetary policies.
The concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European Federation" is perceived as very real.
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We have Schengen space, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said to cooperate only with the countries they want and those they don't want to stand by."
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle that all topics affecting the whole of the Union have to be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
Innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that would express IBM's most accurate strategy, they would probably be closest to "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since its establishment.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He's already stamped a password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" thus became an imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that started to be published in IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means long-term thinking continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her fundamental values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we can achieve even more in the second hundred," said the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano on the anniversary.
Worked-out system
In the 1930's, Watson treated his employees like businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had paid leave as one of the first American employees, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and an elaborate system for the remuneration of the best inventors and traders.
The IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company has been brilliant at extracting talent since the beginning - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination so that it could choose.
In line with the antidiscrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, headed by IBM, will be replaced next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been in IBM for 30 years, so far holding the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called yams, online brainstormings, many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work at the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in the business ensures the company's strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," Professor Harvard Business School told Economist and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or "Big Blue " - as it is famously called because of its logo in the United States - grew up to be one of the world's largest companies in 100 years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a bar code or a floppy disk.
IBM has become roughly $220 billion this year, the second largest technology company according to market caption (the first is Apple) when Microsoft first beats it since 1996.
Front view
Not all products and innovations hit customers' taste and times - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own operating system OS/2, online Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally bind yourself to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, a competing Microsoft that basically stands and falls on Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
Services are mostly involved in IBM sales, after about a fifth it is made up of software and hardware.
In 1990, he was the strongest hardware representative with more than half the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, during the same period it has invested $58 billion in buying forward-looking technologies.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept over the world for the first time.
IBM acts according to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis intact.
The IBM stock price has increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, with the company's net profit continuously increasing.
IBM's corporate password is to change everything but your values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it.
History of IBM: From cheese slicer to space travel
IBM (International Business Machines) was established in New York a hundred years ago, originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over only in 1924 - originally a brand used for branches of companies in Canada and South America.
The basis for later IBM gave fusion to four companies whose history dates back to the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as famous "fingers," i.e. clock recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the supervisory board of the company until 1930.
Flint hired the head of Thomas J. Watson's rival company to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - an invincible corporate culture and identity is still built on Watson's ideas.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat slicers and cheese slicers to cashiers.
During the first four years that Watson was running the company, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and began a vast expansion of the company into all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost 40 years in the chief chair, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, replaced him.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960 ' s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly to space - Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 a famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "bacco" that established the computer standard of that time, called IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself fully to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that pays off in the last three years of IBM is the concept of Smarter Planet.
It aims to make smart use of technology in even unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban management.
For the area of trade, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM of the Czech Republic, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe headquarters in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtárova (53) said the end!
After her husband, Josef Rychtár (53), became not only a protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also a lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now he's not going to wait, and he's made clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," said Rychtárová.
When Darina Rychtárová gave Bartoša asylum in her home in the summer, she probably didn't even dream how her marriage would end.
Even though Iveta moved away from Říčan after 30 days, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, made peace with her husband's relationship, and now she even said goodbye to him forever.
A fisherman doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Rychtř and Bartošová break up once after all, the wife's open arms will not be waiting for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our house together, no one will cast him out."
"But not as my beloved, stray old donkey will live to see him, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," said Rychtářová, saying that she had already withdrawn from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing his back door.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'm gonna be with Iveta, and I'm not gonna change that."
"The wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"Company goes on, I take care of repairs, gardens, real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I are having a normal conversation, except we don't share a bed together," said Lightning Rychtř.
If Rychtárová found a new love, she wouldn't stop her.
" We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I take full responsibility," said Joseph.
Worst female habits: Do they concern you?
If you ask the men if they could name any typical feminine habits, they would usually all be very quick to throw them out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you know yourself in the following lines, where there are several female habits that can perfectly pump blood in men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop in bulk at discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion a little.
But tell me, which would resist just walking around in clothing stores, looking for well-fitted uppers and then trying them all (ideally in different color versions) in the booth?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your guy to wait for you outside the front door...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop caring about yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger the sexes also agree that the higher the frequency of this complaining, the more annoying the women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Cleaning windows, vacuuming, mopping tiles, dusting, scrubbing baths - at least twice a week.
Are you accusing your partner of stepping on a clean pavement with a dirty foot, children, of soiling a scrubbed sink and smearing the glassed living wall with which you've worked so hard to polish?
If you are suffering from this "deviancy," try to realize that nothing should go beyond order and cleanliness should certainly not come first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationship and family well - being.
Digging
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
"Are you gonna wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towel doesn't belong on the floor."
If you poke your partner in such a way several times a day, know that you can reliably piss him off.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to poke them so much...
Smearing, gossiping
For some women there are also slanders, gossips, and insults and consorts against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each one of us will release some small harmless gossip or gossip here and there.
Hand on the heart, it's all women's.
The opposite is the gossip of the roughest grain, which they like and often gossip, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the female work group -.
Jágr and Voráček helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey assailant Jaromír Jagr participated in Monday's NHL game with two assists on Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is once again at the forefront of Czech players' productivity in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the best player in the game, benefited from the review of the 39-year-old star.
Jágra's teammate Jakub Voráček recorded two assists in the match.
After the match, Jagger told overseas journalists that he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
"Before the game, I told him he'd give a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," Jágr explained, after whose action Giroux scored the goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A short time later, the team's second hit had a Czech lead.
The Voracek fought for the Hurricanes disc and presented it among the circles scoring to Maxi Talbot.
The second before the first break reduced in weakening the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Specifically, the Giroux.
After working with Jágre scored the third goal, then his shot remelted flows in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr appreciated his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning around," said Jágr.
Carolina made the match a drama, a goal of Tuoma Ruutu, and again Dwyer, who made it through the penalty shooting, got to the difference of one goal.
But Matt Read didn't allow any further complications, which ended with two-to-one numbers.
"Excellent hit in our Pronger band."
"He pierced the disc, I picked up the speed and (Read) drove to a farther pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia took the lead in winning the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the match against Buffalo, in the second period he resigned due to injuries in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens lost the two-way lines next to the experienced bek and lost after a penalty shootout of 2:3.
One of their raids didn't turn Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than lost points, was saddened by the extensive back row sick, with only five defensemen finishing the match.
"It's bad."
"We only played with one experienced player, the rest were young men."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The alternation shift came down on us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moving the puck out of our zone."
In this we had gaps," added one of the defensemen P.K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg hits to winning 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters shared the goals of the Jets, who interrupted the five-game streak of losses.
How tour prices developed since 1989
By 1989 only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time only sold tours to socialist bloc countries in the vast majority, as travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists thus travelled to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi na Crimea u Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the Czech tourists' journeys to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialism era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at that time, but it was necessary to stand the line overnight with a sleeping bag or to have a "good friend" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without the foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) to travel to the West.
Most often, however, the Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages, which the Czechs bought and survives today.
The Czechs' travel has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we no longer realize today is that it was not possible to travel freely to our most popular Croatia by 1989, as it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa requirements were lifted to neighbouring Western European countries, which started a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria's Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get enough trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to take a look at it for a while.
In Paris, for example, Czech tours slept in tents in parks, as our incomes did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guest house.
A typical feature of Czech traveling at this time was driving your own food, canned goods, salamis, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchangeable Czech koruna, which allowed our tourists to buy Western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and with it average wages were rising, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Due to increased demand for travel, travel agencies have regularly started preparing charter air services tours since 1997, making air tours more incredibly cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantitative discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa-free contact with virtually all developed countries in the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of Puerto Revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when due to considerable demand it was delivered from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exoticity, it was to Thailand.
From this year onwards, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm faraway countries every year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and thus our country has definitely become one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history and spent more than CZK 15,000 per person on one foreign holiday, including on the site.
The General Assembly is to find the chairman, but once again threatens to stalemate.
Almost five months is Czech football without the President and the risk that Ivan Hašek's successor to the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on what electoral order will be followed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in leading Czech football is Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
Hašek resigned from his post in June and on his departure he called on colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hašek, football slipped back to the fights between the two union chambers that couldn't agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16th, when the new President was to be selected.
Delegates of the general meeting went to the National House in Prague on Smíchov for nothing, as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a way of election.
There was no consensus as to who had the right to vote at the assembly - whether only statutory representatives or also officials of the mandate of the power of attorney.
There has been a partial agreement at this point since then, which has also helped the recommendations of the Constitution for the State and the law according to which representation on the basis of the power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
Nor has the executive committee brought too much clarity into the situation, which in its meetings, whether proper or extraordinary, does not actually solve anything else.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in round 3 to rule out the possibility of heel?
"The support is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
According to the statutes of the model proposed in the third round, the candidate who will have greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is said to be willing to make concessions in order to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage.
"But that would leave the two previous rounds meaningless, that would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Party Freedom, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to the existing statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this rather surprisingly, although it is estimated that the statutes of the appointed electoral order are best suited to Pelt of all candidates.
"I wish to vote according to the statutes to the maximum."
"In order not to invent any substitute nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his comments he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he believes that the new President will be known and believe that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passions will calm the national team's possible progress at the European Championship today."
"Soccer will be on a happy wave again, it will be more willing to cooperate," says Jablonec, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It is not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt their regulations."
"This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense prevails," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left to make a deal between all sides.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if soccer generality will be complete until the game.
The air special in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not leave Prague due to technical failure in the morning and was looking for a replacement option how to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barage retaliation.
In the end, a ministerial meeting may be decisive, which may be expected to take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to cause divided parties within the country's strongest sports association to agree.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the planned general meeting of the Czech Republic, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
The bag goes into the fight for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If Pilsen's head of football players Tomáš Paclik had seen a strong candidate before an extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have even applied for a top position.
"If there's a good adept, I'm fighting for it, and I'm not going to the election."
"But no one could find such a person in the current situation," Paclik told ČTK.
In duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclik is driven by motivation to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged election favourite, from heading for the FAČR.
Paclik also stresses that if he won, he would only last until 2013, when there is a proper general meeting on the agenda.
In his capacity, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too connected with football events.
"I've spoken to some people who would be considered."
"It was crazy for me when some people said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclik is said to be the most annoying member of Pelt's association with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Union Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegates' vote at the general meeting.
It's so unacceptable for Paclik to have Pelt in the chair position.
"If he had won, the current condition would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled businessman, football would not benefit even more," said Paclík.
He also points out that Pelt's name was heard in eavesdropping years ago in an investigation into a corruption affair, from which Pelt went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who also takes his former statement with insight that he would "sell the Plzeň Club if Pelta were to become chairman."
But if Paclik triumphed in Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclik before the September general meeting, ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the head of the representation."
"But he couldn't manage the association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I don't know how to," said Paclik, who attracted great attention in September by being behind the appeal of the referee committee headed by Luděk Macela, whose replacement Dagmar Damková replaced.
The bag says he'd be upset about running the association.
He refers to his skills from managing private companies, and since last summer he has also been in charge of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the premiere league triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in a football environment to contribute to his particular cultivation."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which goes into disgusting situations," said Paclik, who does not conceal his antipathy, for example, to Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider it one of the priorities to strengthen relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political leaders for more money from the lottery tax.
"It is one of the key things the new President should be doing."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say where the money goes," he remarked.
As a liability now Paclík does not take his connection with the Plzeň club, although he himself claims that the Chairman of the FAČR should be "superparty".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec again, Rajchl with Prague's Duklou.
"It's not ideal."
"I don't see the point in transferring my shares to someone hypocritically in the Plzeň club and going back there in a year and a half," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR which would exclude the electoral heel
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelt promised that if elected, he would establish new statutes for the FAČR, which would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
Jablonec's official is an optimist before Thursday's Nymburk meeting, and he believes that the election fight will significantly dampen today's success of football representation.
Pelta had already promised before September's impossible election that he was going to focus on representation and fundraising.
He decided to go to the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so he could use a two-month delay to defend his ideas about the management of football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it is high time someone led the association," he means the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the Union.
He also believes that he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that under current election problems, there is a euphoria that ruled during the reign of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Meeting, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought they were."
"If they didn't allow different interpretations, we had the president since September," Pelta said.
It was the revision of the most important document of the civic association that he considered as a decoy to delegates.
"If I become chairman, I'll take it as a personal task and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if I fail."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta claims.
He says he's still trying not to define himself against his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Henry Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he well knows that his opponent would be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Tomáš Paclik, who, on the contrary, did not leave a dry thread on Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's got some success."
"His attacks, however, were undignified, and a lot of people were caught up in campaigning."
"Therefore, many of them now doubt his true character," Pelt said at his opponent's address, who is said to remain faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to representation.
That should be the soccer window.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians case or the reverend of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately jump into negotiations with both the private and state sectors to ensure enough money for the whole football," said the ČTK forty-six-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his coming to football would mean no personnel purges.
"I should first get acquainted with the task of individual employees," he said to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from the long out of control.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming general meeting, they believe that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only point at issue is how to vote in the third round, we can get over it."
"Soccer needs credibility, and it is only by finally having its leader back," Pelta remains an optimist two days before the decisive day of her functional career.
Rajchl promises that under him the FAČR would start working hard
If the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic had been elected at Thursday's general meeting by former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
It wants to promote systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work that was started by previous Chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"I am not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview for the Czech News Agency.
"I am a team player, and I want to divide competence in the executive committee so that each member of the board will engage in a specific area."
"And I'm going to hand out hard tasks to move football a mile forward in each of these segments."
"Many people wouldn't be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was thinking about not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me constantly throwing sticks at me and questioning my every move," he explained.
"But many people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He's also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hašek.
"There's been a lot of work done in the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"There are processes that will be reverberated in a few years' time, and I would not like to see anyone stop them," he said with concern that if another candidate Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation on the Union could return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"There are people behind him who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones."
"I can blame a lot of things, but I certainly can't blame anyone for being sidetracked."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do soccer for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be Czech President.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into a Czech and Moravian section whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would be no present situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík joined the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me Vice-President and sees that there are clear achievements behind me," said Rajchl, who considers his achievements to be saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating TV contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the contrary, he feels he is complicit in the fact that the union is not pulling together.
While he claims to be "disqualified to restore confidence in Czech football" about Pelt, he considers the other of Paclik's opponents to be a strong candidate who has much to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzeň that year."
"If he had been elected, he might have continued with the things that Ivan Hašek had started here and would not have fundamentally changed his staff in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," Rajchl says.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from the point of view of Ufon, a luxury swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels in Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a tour of cities or travel let his tired feet rest in a thermal spa.
The book will show where the wellness near the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder embarked on discovery trips for the past one and a half years, her luggage was not to be missed: her bathing suit.
Lying on the water, she looked up to the height of an artistically shaped dome, swimming across from the marble putti (the figures of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) who waited for her at the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she immediately brought it into her notebook - with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architecture historian Meder and is now presented in his recently published book "Badefreuden (Bathing Joy) ": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of swimming in Schwarzwald, the Hard Core of Concrete Structures in Taunus.
13 countries led her by her "Travel to the most unusual spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
It's not much of a sport, says Meder - it's something else in the water.
The only thing to be angry about is that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating smell of spruce forests or listen to the funny chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to gather nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the jumping pool and ethereal oil for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real sightseeing: "Instead of the floor, man has a watery surface in the spa."
"It is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (Bathing Joy) " provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis wellnes - but above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by Mrs. Meder's collector in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spa, like the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in the original karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a building shaped like a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
In contrast, many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a magnificent spectacle. While a person has a rooftop swimming pool in the whole city, the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton can look at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which it is possible to watch the traffic on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable pool design awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal water park looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Out of three open pans in winter, the steam rises while the mountains of Ötztalu rise to the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder rose to the nostrils of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the spa of Arpad in the Hungarian Békescaba it smells of heating oil to the point that one can hardly believe that it has reached the healing spa.
The smell comes from a medicinal water containing alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate bath Luhačovice, she encountered a closed terrain.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovič designed the spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the crumbling windows of the red-and-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds grow massively between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood up in the magic swimming pool in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already had three phases of construction; man can discover not only the Neo-Romani elements that originated in 1844, but also the Maura Hall in the Alhambra style, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995 Palais Thermal has been Mrs. Iris Meder's favorite spa pool expert, not only because she comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's some kind of performance, bringing together so diverse building patterns into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank has a commodity transaction to investigate
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to Spiegel-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then, in January, the group chief wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
It is clear to the federal people: 84% of Germans, according to one study, consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
In fact, two thirds of those polled demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of this trade because they are deepening the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of the Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on the report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets at global commodity exchanges drive prices to heights, and banks are therefore complicit in the world's hunger problem.
The consumer campaign is directed specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley also act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, most experts agree, however, that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trade have withdrawn from supply and demand - and have made profits on account of the poorest.
Other than competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised that he would test the complaints and said that no trade "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation on the line"
According to Spiegel ONLINE information, the international work group controls complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors - together with a recommendation on how this should be handled.
Then, at the end of January, the Bank's representatives want to state what the consequences will be.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works with his own help on his image.
At the same time, the head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks today harm the general good. "
Have Ackermann as the highest bank lobbyist fulfill his duties.
"Deutsche Bank must cross off its portfolio of all items where money is used to bet on food prices" said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with the hunger of people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he left office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Board of Directors would not be transferred to the Supervisory Board in any other way than planned.
By averting controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - that should eventually be dealt with by his successor.
Each other would say investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday he published a Bode Survey in which the Institute of Forsa asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
According to this, 11 percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments linked to betting on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each other would, as a result of the poll, testify all investments where the money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn known to such a bank, 49 percent said that it would think about shutting down its account and move on to another institution.
21st Century House in Vienna
Moving Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy end: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and soluble.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When it burns for modern postwar architecture, for bright forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karel Schwanzer is a fitting and famous example of the Brussels World Exhibition 1958.
Schwanzer's pavilion received then the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and sublime steel and glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He was famous for the architect by building Austria's pavilion during the next World Exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key made by a secondary building in Munich, 1973 was finally internationally famous.
Its temporary exhibition building was designed by a pavilion after the World Exhibition in Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Railway Station), renovated and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named "The House of the 20th Century."
But suitable for the museum building was neither spatially nor technically - the walls were missing for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Yet it was used until contemporary art reached its new booth in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and decayed more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, bearing the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, opens its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery, was pushed through.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with an outstanding career, i.e. as a young figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museo Moderna Salzburg, pushed through a reenactment with politicians and memorialists, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same name foundation, a cafe and a bookstore should be created, and an office building had to be built.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the execution.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer Technical University in Vienna and the pavilion was a "imminently important place" where "almost every weekend" he looked at exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it moved to Vienna and changed its use.
During the current reconstruction, there were much bigger problems: the building was "a catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
Profiles of glass facade windows were replaced, used with glass fiber reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams have been amplified or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings are remediated.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a closed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a bountiful Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door was preserved, the building is painted in an old anticorrosion red brown colour tone.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict surveillance of the monument office and the low budget.
"Sometimes material was found that was good and cheap and also liked the landmark office," says Krischanitz and points to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult with the pavilion "which came here from Brussels" recently said Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-History."
Such architecture is said to stand "always in the wrong place " and yet wants to" awaken proper self - confidence. "
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, as urban luck happened: In the Schweizer Garten circuit there is a completely newly designed "Městská čtvrť u Hlavní nádraží" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps another lucky coincidence will happen: The house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as it is heard, is already negotiating with the town about the neighborhood at the station in Schweizer Garten.
The track plans a package for the winter crisis of a million
The runway has pierced a crisis plan to prevent train outages during the winter season.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the cold caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn spends more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report referring to the internal group plan that it is supposed to be expected to invest around 300 million euros by 2015.
It is said to achieve better use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
It is said that the number of internal and external employees is doubled to 16 000 persons to remove snow on railway installations and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for operation of the necessary switches within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, head of the railroads, warned the government and industry of train failures and delays during this winter.
During the last winter period, passenger transport had considerable problems because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, there was a shortage of reserves.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, delays in the ICE train reporting process are being made
The runway has also been unable for years to cope with the fact that ICE trains must be checked more frequently by the Dutch when a train of ICE at the Cologne Central Station has been destructed.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the US
After the upheaval around boss Josef Ackermann, there is a new trampot in the US: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of compensations there.
As if Deutsche Bank hadn't had enough problems at home, it caught up with his past in the U.S.: The Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million (EUR106 million) in one balancing procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is a sale of mortgage sheets.
The NCUA financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for having seduced cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers have lost a great deal of value during the crisis and have led banks to the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we could have solved the subject without the need to drag the parties to court" said Deutsche Bank's spokesperson in New York.
The bank doesn't plead guilty.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed to paying $20,5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the helpfulness of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the US and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for the billionaire damage incurred.
The settlements now completed are the first of their kind.
The controller was also attached to other large banks and in the summer he sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
For dubious mortgage sheets, it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, it became fatal for a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Even though events took place a few years ago, there is now a sharp wind blowing in the banks' mouths.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous actions to remedy or affect misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He blames 18 international big banks that two state-owned real-estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have put some $200 billion in mortgage deals at a disadvantage.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA suit, which is more than one transaction worth about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "the substantial losses " without, of course, giving any precise amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
The financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT business.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, America's important investor Warren Buffett has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term development of companies is only allowed to be predicted with difficulty.
But now he has read the business reports of IBM and has changed his opinion on investment in the business.
Much earlier he had to understand that IBM mainly offers services and acquires computer systems for IT separation of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is considered to be a knight's match.
As a result, it may be called the mother rock IT IBM now "Sir IBM."
Because Buffett leaked to the US CNBC's economic radio station that since March he bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised management, which even sought proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett on strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres for a long time.
More than a 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett was rather avoiding technology companies to date.
They claim to invest only in enterprises whose activities they also understand.
Instead, Buffett reached on the freight railroad, on the lubricant manufacturer or on the machine products.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a number of large-scale companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, a former Münchener Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old master took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built it into one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a iconic figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's shares increased by one percent before the stock market started.
Big Blue, as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock market and is considered to be the world's most valuable technology enterprises along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to get in.
The founder of Bill Gates is said to be his intimate friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "cells in Zwickau," Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The paper even speaks of a "bloody ideology " that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was addressed in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For for many German Turks, this brings back a ghost that was long considered dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
Yet there was never any doubt about this in Germany.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a range whose dimension can no longer be seen.
"Is bloody ideology alive again?" was the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police agent to the Department of Constitutional Protection and fear that the German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community responded with a strong response: On the weekend of the demonstrations, it remembered the silence before the brandebury gate of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, remembered the festive act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
There are a number of Turkish media reports here: "A gift to Germany for 50" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which reports on the background of the murder series.
The issue of the "Hürriyet " for Germany, too, is not to be taken to make this thought connection.
"It's starting to stink" is the headline of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and who made an important contribution to Germany's restoration were murdered.
The most critical is discussed in German internet forums the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why didn't the German authorities think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are shown at least rhetorically prompt to use drastic means: "If the activity continues to be so superficial, there will be nothing left for immigrants except their own defence and armed."
"That's probably best self-defense."
"The quality of the clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network is highly dependent on internal peace in Germany," writes Selenium.
What it means if internal peace is threatened in Germany, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burn site in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
But the assassinations have made the Turks' side more noticeable.
Do Not Repeat Past Mistakes
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the assassinations was mainly criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish state president, but at the funeral ceremony in Köln he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the local Turks had passed on.
Quite as if the value of a person was measured by the height of his taxes.
The current news of Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks is in the local state's legal order.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandal bank at Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis, and since then it has been slipping from one crisis to another.
Now some German's gotta straighten it out.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
Following his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that 2013 will take up almost as spectacular a new job: President of the board of directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praised Switzerland whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached turnover."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would turn out completely different.
One dealer from UBS in London has bypassed all the bank's security systems, and about 1.7 billion euro has been squandered.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only a respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the UBS Board of Directors has also been like a boiled one - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that Weber has been able to advise the bank since February 2012.
And the chairmanship of the Management Board will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough on Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work on it.
He will then take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which once again proved that it deserves the title "Banca of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
For UBS is both huge - until recently the world's largest asset manager - and has been slipping for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing seems to be spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS enjoyed excellent reputations.
The image of a silent and solid but also cunning property manager combines with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 managed on one side with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she's advanced as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a longtime banking professor in Zurich, relates: "I always introduced UBS to my students as a role model for a good bank at the time. "
"From today's point of view, one asks, "How could I have been so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
For the first time in 2007, it was clear that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli's chief of directors, who was still considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he knew why he left.
The Bank's investment division squandered Subprime Papers and had to write off billions.
To keep it going, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But she found real investors, but one that would have been a noseful of recently: the Discreet Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first impact.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS stood up for its failed investments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank purchased tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatory exchangeable bonds for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - as it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of Switzerland's economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save UBS again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and showed willingness to issue data to wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return to unauthorized profits from these transactions, including a fine premium.
In doing so, UBS has confessed more or less openly that it has helped to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrets were no longer what they had before.
The resignation of the Board of Directors and the President of the Board of Directors followed.
And an exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas within a few months: investment banking due to poor speculation and asset management for tax reduction.
And just as things calmed down a little bit, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business analysis: The only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it is clear: the risk management in investment banking is still not working out.
"The case of Adobuli has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Bank Institute of Zürich University.
The financial director of the large German bank is also confident: "The problem with UBS is that it cannot control the risks. "
It was precisely her idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers stepped out a long time ago to become guardians of the great possessions of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - also from this side the Alpine Republic collapsed again.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high quality chocolates.
UBS headquarters in Zurich is even more suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it is just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Bahnhofstraße, Zurich, which leads directly to the Lake Zurich, which is framed by snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Jewelry stores like Tiffany's are found here among Swiss traditional shops such as Sprüngli candy stores.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of UBS enters with a heavy rotating door.
Inside there are walls lined with marble, standing in front of them massive leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large signpost to the "safe."
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
However, both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse sometimes suppressed or betrayed this idea, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He'd rather not read his name in the papers, end up closing business with both large banks, like all Swiss bankers.
The UBS may have grown too large, it finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything left to say.
"And if they had, they would have adapted long ago to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits at first and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven million-dollar country came to its greatest rescue in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two out of three Swiss big banks joined a massive group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and was growing ever more.
In doing so, it helped that the two different bank predecessors of UBS supplemented: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a centre of gravity in asset management and poorer, but internationally more heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came to the advantage of a lot of money, with which they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the head of the UBS and Marcel Ospel Group, then the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, the person controlling feelings around the stomach, who has developed from banking science to the very top."
But they say Ospel relied on Wuffli at the end.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "Probably thought his models were real" says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of executives, at which the group boss Wuffli repeated the same password all over again: To bring Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She was showing "League Tables," a waiting list documenting the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS tried to place it at the top.
She's already done a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she participated in the game at the top.
However, business advisors who have been entrusted stress one weakness: In international interest trade, in the words of the bankers "Fixed Incume," there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to have an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and the fund based by it invested to ensure risks to Subprime's US investment.
It developed into a massive machine that changed securities into US mortgage loans and passed on - but it also kept its own risks.
Also, when the other banks were long ago looking for a way out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there" says bank expert Geiger.
How big the euphoria is and how deep the fall is.
One manager after another had to leave when trying to clean up was harder than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a eject seat and to this day they are rocking.
Whoever runs the big bank now has almost impossible work to do.
They need to find a strategy for the bank that all the nearby business models have disappeared.
Bank expert Geiger already has the idea: No more investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far.
But investment banking is about to go down, so much is clear now.
Next Thursday, the new head of Sergio Ermotti Bank wants to introduce his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he made his point: He has long run the UBS business, announced by the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on track in the mid-1990s.
3500 places are crossed out.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
In public, however, he says only that he and his mistress will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

Europe will not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of banks' weakness.
The legend of the investment Warren Buffett just confirmed this outlook: He said in one CNBC-interview that it will probably not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early for him to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left a few decades old principle and entered the American technology industry.

Intelligent Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, field ravens are considered to be "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, claims experts.
One likes them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been in the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities complaints of the population about the dirt and noise caused by animals are accumulated.
At the same time, there is still no means in sight of the "problem birds. "
The field ravens can no longer be evicted from the cities, said experts on the first symposium about the crows in Leer, East Africa.
There experts from all over the Federal territory consulted on possible starting points.
Looking for alternatives in cities
In doing so, conservationists have also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of particularly protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing development and cutting down typical trees make it difficult for birds to nest.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting couples are among others in the Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achimu at Bremen and Leer.
There 2005 caused a controversial project of mass killing crows in the rural district of negative headlines.
Critics have labeled the capture of animals into traps for birds and killing sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal exorcism, scaring, nothing brings anything," found so much by city planner and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said also the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Beasts retreat, large colonies break down and divide into other places."
Scaryness is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
The combination of driving animals out of sensitive residential areas and luring them to settle elsewhere is possible.
Instead of chainsaws, the "information board" was promoted by a psychologist and ethnoologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of completely different treatment of animals: "We can eventually best overcome one of the carbons in our faces with confidence."
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascherberg educational crows trail, on which they provide information boards lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been accepted by tourists in the meantime.
Mrs Jürgens also expressed her own view of the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say to each other. "
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Field ravens use not only tools to achieve a treat, but even make their instruments as a tool.
Researchers from Cambridge University recently tested behavior on four field ravens as far as bird intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must cause the collapse of the structure to reach the larva of the pier.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, cunning crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder, researchers placed a small container with a larva pier.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
From them, all four animals formed a hook, using which as a hook they hunted from the tube the vessel behind the holder.
Three out of four field ravens even succeeded with a stump.

Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic

After the intervention against Helder Postig in Bosnian crime territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded Portugal a yellow card. (36.).
On the other hand, Stark kicked the disputed penalty after the Fabio Coentraa action, which changed Misimovice with certainty.
But after the break, the European Vice-Chief from 2004 clarified everything with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended his last doubts in 81 minutes.
With this, the Champion of Europe leaves from 1976 after the fifth in a row to the European Championship.
The team of Coach Michal Bilk with the legionnaire Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the beginning.
The goaltender Petr Čech prevented the possibility of his own goal by Tomáš Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its best options when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the speed from the border of the criminal territory just around Bohemia's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already collided goalie of the Czech world class, once again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50.).
The goal soon before the conclusion finally cleared everything up.

While National Coach Guus Hiddink is almost certain to have his seat on the third bench at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians may rejoice in their fourth turn in the final round of the European Championship.

Selcuk Inan shot only a stick from a distance in the seventh minute, assailant Kazim also could not bounce the ball in the goal.
After this horrible second, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Also, after the Croats broke, they didn't get the goal.

Konstantin Vassilyev (57.) equalized for the guests.
Ireland has set the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.

After the failed defense of goalie Pavel Londak Ward was on the scene and pushed the ball over the line to a state of 1:0.

A personal massacre
Emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund called Beauty and Grief: The Secret History of World War I (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of performers that you will get dizzy.
One piece of advice on how to act at that moment: Pluck this page carefully and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know all the people in the novel story of Mr Englund very well, and this list will serve you as a navigation - a kind of beacon - at times when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it quite correctly, as "an antihistorical work."
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, almost missing ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, it explains the author, as it explains "a book about what it was like," mainly "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"Beauty and grief" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives are flickering like flames of candlelight burning in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of fates while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classical historical novels.
It alters the idea that World War I was just about the terrifying trenches on the Western front.
The "beautiful and sorrowful" is skilled in exploring other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with bee nests falling on them, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or facing the presence of flies tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, this is a very touching reading.
War consumes people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts in the distance and you're the woman who's at home with her kids, will you run away or stay?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the entire war was unleashed.
"The vacuum resulting from the lack of facts," noted Mr Englund, "was filled with conjecture, conjecture, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors. "
"Beautiful and sad" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are generally taken from CVs, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and intriguing, but the inclusion of tiny moments and details makes them absolutely alive and believable.
Many of them discuss suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Substitutes everywhere, substitutes everywhere. "
"Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to "meat produced from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), dried roots tobacco and dried potato husks, shoes with wooden soles'.
It mentions that there was "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds within himself an impulse for wildness and brutality, saying of war: "You will finally understand that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable seats with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretending that this mask represents civilization and that there is no barbarian behind the starchy self inside. "
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon, and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When you finally accept the sacrifice, you would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict whom he secretly hangs. "
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict has become increasingly economic competition and competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a articulate and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor - made dress that does his carnage without rising from the table. "
People act all unexpectedly, meanness takes turns with heroism.
Mr Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the gonococcal pus trade, which the soldiers bought and rubbed their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate have rubbed it in their eyes, which has often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose is swift, but not spectacular, which fits his human subject perfectly.
In dozens of minor outputs, it captures the way in which war "has unleashed completely out of control: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred. "
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I have mostly worked with hints, such as "World War I and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "The Western Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending in popular teaching literature.
But I won't tell you.
But you'll feel like the author jumped out of the book, pulled the page out of your list of heroes and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute exactly planned raid
Hundreds of police officers participated in it, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was elected because at that time the park of Zuccotti should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers. The others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly led the operation, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
It was not allowed to repeat cases in recent weeks when, for example, pepper sprays have been used against demonstrators, thereby violating the rules of the department and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy has spilled over to the squatters' side.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at cleaning Zuccotti's park from demonstrators was initiated after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by operations conducted in other cities.
Massive behavioral exercises in crisis situations took place in Randalls Island, which was preparing for action in Zuccotti park.
Leaders have increased the so-called riot prevention training - counterterrorism measures involving the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - focusing on the Lower Manhattan district.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" declared someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "training."
"I know a few police officers who have also been called to this event, and no one has told them that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who only spoke on condition that he remains anonymous.
"Only senior members of the department knew we were going to Zuccotti Park."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, city officials planned to clear the park, but then they retreated from the plan, because as soon as protesters heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people were coming to the park and leaving again, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there would be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of the streets of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge, freight wagons of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and recorded message roaring from the amplions scared many protesters.
When law enforcement members entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their things.
Other police teams were spotted gathering at the edge of the park so that they could enter it if there were any arrests to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesperson for the police department, Paul J. Browne, claimed that this was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers treated them harshly.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street, leading along the western border of the park, could shoot without a problem.
Police progressed in the west direction and tangled themselves with a dense mess of personal matters of protesters, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing. They were followed by teams from the sanitary department, which immediately collected everything that was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting images appeared shortly afterwards on the Internet.
The most glamorous group of protestors have resorted to the kitchen in their campsite, which lay near the center of the park.
Some have set up a roadblock, and police have started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp have cuffed each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, sounded like a police statement.
Mr. Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "organization of riots and resisting arrests," he explained.
The highest ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of Police Department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives in the department, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he was not involved in the operation," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were erected.
From these places the police developed a protective belt even further away from the park Zuccotti.
Police officers were spotted in one place, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they oppress persons even further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., a protester was spotted just south of Pine Street jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others venting air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, a police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The Auxiliary Workers' Union will sue the city for release
Unions representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that dismissal was not necessary and it was also discrimination because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The judicial dispute is probably the last option left for the unions in District Council 37 in their attempt to reverse the dismissal decisions.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst-paid employees of the city, lost their job. Their release was described by union leaders as a retaliation of the city for not allowing him access to the health care fund administered by the labor squads through which the city wanted to seal the budget hole.
The city officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council meeting last month, Dennis M. Walcott said that redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the board immediately questioned the fact that there was no specific mention of the release of auxiliary workers in the budget.
Representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will convene a press conference, where they will formally announce the suit before the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight redundant workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, said that the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, so she would not comment on individual charges.
According to a complaint proposed by the New York Times, the trade unions focused on the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, which they wanted to support their allegations of unfair conduct, because they believe that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while in schools in Staten Island, 17 school assistants were not dismissed at all and at least in the Upper East Side, Brooklyn, even 46 assistants were released in the District 23 in Brownsville, and in the District 8 and 9 parts of the South Bronx.
He reminds us that five out of eight assistants lost their jobs at Public School 36 in Harlem, although it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty.
Public School 36's budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus funds for every poor student applied for.
The unions, among other things, claim that high school directors could have been confused in the manner in which a document authorising the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," states the complaint proposal, "and not merely moved into the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before that happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the reigning dictator Muammar Qaddafi had to be captured and killed and the United States troops' participation terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate's International Relations Commission will decide on an opinion supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thank the US troops for their "bravery."
"We want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
Those sentences may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has been easy until now.
During the summer, legislators from both sides were constantly arguing with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of statements for approval or, on the contrary, rejecting the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of US armed forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures to stop financing US operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. mission in Libya was literally in legislative purgatory - Congress criticised the way President Obama ran the mission, but apparently it didn't irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
In the end, Congress' hesitation was ahead of other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
Mission Nato officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the Commission on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity, which they have made in an effort to free their people" and " praises the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies, who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population, for extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya'.
Will the new proposal be fully supported by the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be divided again in two halves, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian), the leading representative of the Republican Party on the Commission.
On Monday, Lugar's spokesperson said he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution concerning the budget or other subject on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
The other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals through to the vote itself, despite considerable efforts.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 additions to the constitution, which were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
Only in the House can there be at least 15 versions of a balanced budget supplement and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending."
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the early Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authorship."
The revenue on budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment relating to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration to support the emergence of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the limitation of the number of periods during which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be held by the President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a number of additions to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an amendment prohibiting the marriage of same-sex couples and an amendment prohibiting the burning of the national flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of states oppose them.
Although the members of Congress seem to be very active in the design of various amendments, they do not, however, deviate significantly from the average compared to previous flights.
In 111, Congress offered 77 amendments, while in 100, there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison with the early 1990s, when, according to Senate library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, however, it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Whacked but not defeated," says Gifford in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after the shooter injured her from the immediate vicinity at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declared that she wanted to recover more than return to Congress.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" at ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was obvious that the production of sentences was still causing problems and needed help walking.
The entire program documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the bullet wounds that punctured her skull in the front, penetrated her left half of the brain and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
During her first TV interview from January's shooting during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, smiled, and sang - and described her recovery as "tough. "
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, 41 - year - old Giffords replied: "Pretty good. "
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour special of the 20/20 series, which was broadcast on the eve of the release of the new book of this couple entitled "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope."
The special tracked down the entire Gifford recovery since the 8th of January shooting.
The videos that Kelly made during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, he can't do more than just lift one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and therapists are teaching her how to do simple activities.
Noding your head.
Lip pouting.
And then, her first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords said another word - "toast" when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a crucial role in the recovery of Giffords: Congresswoman sings on them together with the therapist on melody to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, sawyer revealed that she didn't remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford was reading newspaper articles about the shooting on March 12th, when she first asked him who the six were killed in the incident.
There's a suspect named Jared Lee Loughner who's being held in Missoura Prison, where under the influence of violent drugs, he's waiting for trial.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords to Sawyer.
"Awful, awful, awful."
Kelly Sawyer was told that at one point his wife said during the recovery, "I lost."
"So I immediately said to her, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you're gonna make it, you're gonna pull yourself together, and you're gonna come back even stronger than ever."
Military units meet with compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that brought millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines gathered around him.
The ceremonially dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The ceremonial evening was attended by the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. In addition to him was Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military troops somewhat differently.
"Everyone was introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is immeasurably included in praise for its victims.
But these praises are worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were feeling sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon leaves Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to seem ungrateful or to mess up relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops returning from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken in silence and privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat operations where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from outside the army from two angles.
From some point of view, he will feel respect and amazement because they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will wonder if "a veteran is hiding under the surface, " said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and took his place in Washington in the government when he returned.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people interviewed him discreetly suggested whether he could resist the stress associated with his work in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The troubling army partly stems from America's indifference to war.
Success on the battlefield rarely reaps recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army, and finds little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it used to be during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of events they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The military is under increasing pressure to hit rape hard.
This week, he will decide whether a trial of 28 women and men against the military will be initiated due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to sue.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was reportedly raped by her military colleague, 25 years old, and was at 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they might have a drink in her room.
"The warning light went on in my head," said Lyman.
But the native Texas completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they walked into her room, a man went over to her room, threw her on the bed, and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lyman and 27 other existing or former military members will be waiting for a verdict of a hearing that might have a historical impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will be the case if the charges against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to justice.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington's lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at that time. However, during the following months, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their military colleagues and that the army failed to investigate, punish and any pursuit of justice following the announcement of these attacks.
Burke says he's after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to avoid the attempt to impose measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of other actions brought in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than putting all the charges in this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she'll sue in more different cases if she needs to keep the pressure down.
The defense defense team is led by the U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his co-workers, initiated a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents received by Newsweek discuss the defense strategy in detail - the fact that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for the injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decree called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries that will be sustained by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries concern the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence has refused to comment on this matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not allowed to serve officially in combat, it is just word-telling: it is hard to find a clear line in modern wars.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers have played an increasingly important role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women occurring in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
The time has come for modernization in the military too, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a Veteran seminar on legal services prepare a lawsuit against four major military academies for supposedly developing an atmosphere that promotes hate for women.
Independently of this, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans gathers evidence for its action against the military. This action focuses on the diagnosis of "personal defect" allegedly found in rape victims, so that the military has a pretext for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a group of human rights fighters, the Service Women's Action Network, is a common practice.
In December, its group had already filed a motion for an action against a state organisation for dealing with veterans, accusing them of discriminatory practices that were to occur in the processing of requests for assistance by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for Preventing and Solving Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In a report issued in March, the rate of criminal prosecution of suspects is also discussed: 20 percent of cases reported in the military were brought to trial in 2010 - half compared to the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of a number of traumas.
For example, Private First Class Lyman reported alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it was due to occur.
During the night, she says she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She had all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the assailant was found in her bed from the wound she took on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended hearings in court during which she was asked questions about whether she was making love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses of the rumor in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually exonerated.
"I remember the day of the judgment," says Lyman.
"I had a feeling I was going to give birth right there - screaming out of the courtroom."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his trial.
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder, calling her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to the service.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors moves to the next stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of negotiations."
But between them and the verdict stands the mentioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind because their obligations do not allow them to follow the same level of motivation and deterrents.
He adds: "The odds are hard against them... but it is important for them to try. "
The only way to change is if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkekoá, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to file charges and start working on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue where reform will not come from," he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes first.
The Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Examine You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to July's murderous rage, after which 77 were left in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them isn't really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the leading author of a recent British research team report on European digital populism.
The supply of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett, that it was enough for scientists to simply use the ad on the site to determine with absolute precision the wanted demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups who focused on them and sent out ads, but instead of inviting them into a new group or offering them some diet products, they called on them to fill out a questionnaire that raised questions about their level of education, their relation to violence and optimism in relation to their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without even having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are generally young men who are enraged by the increasing level of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, ranging from health problems to social trends hiding with updates of states, contributions to walls and pressed "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them will provide three different data on average, which makes this social network literally "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new researches. The number of academic works in whose name the word Facebook is found has risen to almost 800% compared to the state five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to conduct a survey among the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a side where they'd never let you go," says Bartlett.
"This is all on Facebook - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent on this subject.
Moreno suggests that students monitor the site and offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you cannot diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify endangered children that we otherwise wouldn't have had a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The website's information team has produced statistics on the relationship status context and Valentine's Day, the 2010 election participation and the national satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is being watched whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site needs to be provided with personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. On-line data, however, are accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users even thought that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, a study from 2006, which he conducted using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they felt that information was between them and their friends."
Subsequently, it is also to consider the issue of methodology.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and posts on the wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely differentiated things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who spent years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
"When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities still take place off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to making two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of "the resistance" during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you have been given a mandate by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I admit no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik broke off during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views. "
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought his speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Breivik in custody for the next 12 weeks, forbidding him from any contact with the media for four weeks and announcing that the final authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope that they could look the Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he was kept locked up.
Everyone participated in the case to move the case to an early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said one of the survivors of the attack.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I went a little further mentally."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and departure to the building without any difficulty looking present to journalists and survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger resistance movement, the judge found that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
Some may find it comforting that the attacks of June 22 appear to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she'd fall out like a monster, but that's not the case," said one of the victims' relatives.
"If I did, everything would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie going to the movies this week
Once Steve Jobs died on October 5, people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and elected him his genius as the Greatest Modern Inventor.
At the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted for a special film that is heading for the cinema this week, the fact will be for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and working flows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer, and self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who matched every detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffered "the idea that 90 percent of their work was really great... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent result there is still a long way to work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on a TV show called Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour-long interview took place.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company NeXT, and he eagerly looked at the general public's acceptance of the Internet.
Only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used on the TV show and the original copies of the interviews were said to have been lost during transport.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly edited, forms the basis of a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which goes to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
Jobs is surprisingly enthusiastic about discussing his technological philosophy and business strategies to someone who is famous for his dislike to give longer talks.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, a longer pause will occur between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is seen how Jobs thinks perfectly to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, when he is impatient about Cringely's questions and drives him to get to more important problems and topics.
The interview was recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, and there are frighteningly prophetic ideas in it when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It's one thing to read the postmortem assessments of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as a eager dreamer in the bloom of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things might and should look like.
It did not take long, and after he had expressed his thoughts, he also began putting them into practice.
A quick sum of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"During years of business, I always asked, "Why are you doing this?" and the answer was always the same: "Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, never think about business matters in depth.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounts in Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often began with the inscription "standard costs," their amount could only be imagined. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine commercial costs within a short time.
How he performed the pope's mischief:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to effectively hack into the phone company and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
A number of things have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
It tells how they tested the device with Wozniak using a paid phone and during the call they were transferred from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times we've gotten in and around the world, so when we yelled something into a pay phone, it sounded a minute later from the other phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found that we could build ourselves a thing capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
The two of us made a little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would ever have come up without it.
Jobs continues to describe a joke that he and Wozniak almost made to the end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, impersonating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called on to speak with an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and only just before the pope himself woke up to the phone, the couple blew up and laid down the earpiece.
How he fell in love with technology (and telephoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett's phone book number and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"I was incredibly influenced, and it was the only company I had known at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company was and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the corporate research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him instantly.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher in HP, hanging around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovation invents:
In several places, Jobs discusses how he invents new products on the run.
In the early days of his career, when he went out to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together an entire computer for him.
At his disposal he had only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, assembled and delivered the finished equipment.
Later, when he was at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how wildly we argued... shouting at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300] when I got tired of it, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies run out of breath:
Long before he led Apple's resurrection, Jobs foresaw that many industrial leaders would waver in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you do better photocopiers or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are already in control, so companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led society to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
Could have been ten times the size of it, could have been Microsoft of the '90s...
But instead of winning, they lost.
As he takes innovation as a form of art:
"There is still a long journey and a lot of work between excellent ideas and excellent resulting products... and as the great idea develops, it also changes and grows."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to come to a whole series of compromises - you just don't make certain things happen with electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, taste matters - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in some ways you try to project them into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and by coincidence also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas dined with the opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would accept an objection to President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a festive dinner sponsored by a law firm that would attend the hearing before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals made.
One of the cases under discussion was the action brought by 26 states questioning the radical re-evaluation of health care approved last year by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the action, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the result of which will further stir up the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
Paul Clement, most likely serving as US Attorney General under the rule of George W. Bush, will stand before the Court of Justice and try to enforce the law.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society group, which has been engaged in defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at the Washington hotel several hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
He participated in it, among others, also Mitch McConnell, the leading representative of the Republicans in the Senate and confirmed opponents of the Health Care Act.
Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: This pair of judges has been participating in the actions of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's certainly not about anything that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are relieved of the obligation to respect the principles of conduct that are subject to the lower federal judges.
However, if this were not the case, their behaviour would certainly fall under the principle of C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are being organised by related and other organisations in order to obtain funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor be included on the agenda of the action."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms acting in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and dining at a social fund-raiser together with lawyers waiting to discuss their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the feet with all claims of unbiasedness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics and told them that they also combined their judicial duties with actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, the conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General under President Obama's rule when the first objections against the law came to trial.
Critics of Kagan are pushing her to renounce her involvement in the case, and she claims that she fought for the law so much that she could now be unbiased.
Kagan didn't suggest she was going to resign.
Boeing received a record contract for jet aircraft worth USD 18 billion
Emirates airlines order 50 two-ball jet aircraft Boeing 777 with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if Boeing Co. is the company and the price of these 50 aircraft totals USD 18 billion, it is something else.
The same important news is where Boeing got the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2 520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
On the weekend Boeing announced its largest order in history regarding the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-ball jet Boeings 777.
A sensational contract came from the Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would lead to a total value of USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Omar Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also known as Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to oil - mining nations there.
This means that they have not only the money to pay for the aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly the damaging airline, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive because the country is making money on higher oil prices itself.
This is important because it is not as likely for them as for other airlines that they could cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates airline contract strengthens Boeaing's leading position in the wide hull aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to the narrow ones that wanted to try to disrupt Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft will be postponed, which is a direct competitor of 777-300ER.
The displacement took place because customers demanded more utility load of the aircraft and range, so the manufacturer took time to supply the machine with more power of the engine.
The price of Boeing Co's actions increased by 1,5% to USD 67,94.
The Mexican president's sister was apparently defeated in the Michocacan election.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejo's PRI, was helped by drug dealers in pursuit of the governor's chair.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderon lost in a violent state election for governorship in Michoacan. On Monday she subsequently declared that drug dealers helped one of her opponents to win.
The preliminary results attributed the leadership to Faust Vallejo by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, a.k.a. PRI, in the Western state's presidential election.
"The involvement of organized crime members in the entire electoral process and especially until yesterday's course of the elections is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview for the radio day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... confiscating ballot boxes, building roadblocks... and letting people vote on the PRI order.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its Presidency.
But he is planning an early return to power, and winning the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was leading Calderon very closely the day before the election.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative party of her brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureolis, candidate for the left-wing party of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, has been in control of the governor's office until now.
Aureoles also refused to recognise preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
For a long time, Mikhail was ruled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
This is President Calderon's home state, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
But violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN, Luisa Marie Calderon's follower, was murdered only a week before the election, and many candidates resigned for fear.
However, whatever the results of the elections in Michoacán look like for the PRI party, winning the party will help to gain a new impulse.
The expected PRI party representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallejo and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging due to the coming year. "
ADB Bank calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Bank's Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise an overall decline in the world economy could occur, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of Asia's economies.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB, based in Manila, said that two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all of Europe's problems "too excited" and said that Asian financial assistance combined with European leadership and resources would help to eradicate the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but she is definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested by a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the Heads of Government of Italy and Greece have withdrawn.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns about bringing the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge to bring the emerging leading economies together and help the eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds by the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, an institution for European financial stability - would provide more negotiating opportunities for Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying-out of foreign capital inflow.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are faced with a difficult task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It is not an alternative, it is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as those in India, have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from USD 2 or less per day.
"They might find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their vacation on the beaches, which they might find difficult to explain," he remarked.
Lee Howell, CEO of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to keep well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is threatening a "dangerous domino effect."
The bank's forecast that 7,5% of economic growth will occur in Asia between 2011/12 now faces a "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable emerging markets must develop 'predictable spending plans' in order to protect them from a decline and a significant capital drain from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon on possible cuts in the field of defense
On Monday, Defense Minister Leon Panetta put a lot of pressure under the boiler in Congress to warn that looming automatic budget cuts could endanger national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next ten years, but now it fears a reduction of USD 600 billion if Congress fails to conclude an agreement on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress' failure to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called attachment would cause 23% of the flat-rate decline and the cessation of many new projects.
"It will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, cutbacks will also be touched by combat troops, announced Panetta.
"Although the accounts for financing potential overseas war operations will not be directly affected, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The conditions of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and subsequent distortions of legal and political support."
Both senators wrote Panett off ten days ago and asked him for details on possible impacts on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"Consequences of the department of defense could lead to a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panette's letter.
"It's not a conclusion that we could live with, and we certainly don't want to sign for it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"We will only see if Panette's letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress's budget approval and amplify the voices calling to miss the Pentagon from the list of cut-off areas.
Panetta has recently been more and more open in talks about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved to a high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute week, the Minister of Defence indicated a brief picture of what his resort could expect - an army shell, which, however, will lack the core.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"He will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the speech at the Pentagon.
"She'll be like a moralless unit, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the annex, delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "high operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction in landing and deployment capabilities worldwide; an assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35 project, the planned new bomber, the new generation's ballistic submarine, the new coastal battleship and the new ground-based combat vehicle that the army and the Marine Corps wanted to replace with humvee.
Stopping the further development and testing of the F35 would save USD 80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters argue that this is a necessary next step in improving the army that needs to be dealt with by the country with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize Lies
A glimpse of recent headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full of accusations that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim the other one is lying.
Managers at Penn State University were accused of perjury when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barrack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy the entire career and cloud the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by undisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using his campaign funds to try to hide his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that flew by Bill Clinton when he lied during his second period in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
It's all crawling with stories about cheating at school and college.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good in their own opinions.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many scams are we dealing with?
Studies show that in one day you'll lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first encounter.
Determining lies, or "recognition of lies, " is an essential skill that everyone should acquire, for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that is similar, say, to Charade, when a person shouts out: "I have you." The recognition of deception is a serious sector of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're sneaking around, stuttering, blushing or sewing.
However, do not conclude that it is somehow difficult to spot and expose a liar.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence building, small facial expressions, a way of creating questions and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from an extensive and emerging lie recognition sector, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can help you greatly in today's difficult world - especially if your duties include hiring, organising interviews, negotiating or conducting people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them down guard, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men utter more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (all the lies they say are usually "infamous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called early observation.
Thanks to him, he'll have a later finding out what to compare with.
Notice the posture of the subject, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone is always taping their feet so that you don't wrongly accuse him of lying just because he starts taping his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to determine the clumps of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But consider it merely as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
Lying people can stop moving the upper half of their body, trying to remember their imaginary story, they can turn the boot tips to the door, lean to the exit, significantly change the posture, or show "relax after the interview" - an overly relaxing breath and a change of position when the confession behind them is difficult.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see what relief will look like after the interview.
Also feel the language of the subject.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once misjudged himself and used past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which ran a nationwide search for her body.
Deceiving individuals can also express themselves with measure: "I had no sexual relationship with the Miss Lewinsky... or they will repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal characters are very tiny.
Someone can use a lot of "leathering language" when they answer the difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... from my best knowledge."
In such an answer, we will not learn much of the facts, and it is often another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire skills that can help you track a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a crook in his personal and professional life.
A controversial plan for the construction of oil pipelines will be redirected after the threat of delaying approval by the U.S. government has emerged.
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - turning unions against each other, but calming environmentalists - a company in charge of the pipeline construction announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things would get moving again.
On Monday evening, TransCanada announced that it would move the planned pipeline route from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and it is convinced that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska Government.
TransCanada Alex Pourbax's leader claims that the company is convinced that eventually the construction of the pipeline will be approved even though it will lead by another route.
This announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it postponed the decision on the federal permit of the project from where it would not conduct studies of possible alternative routes, which could not affect Sandhills area in Nebraska and Ogallala water level, a large underground reservoir of water.
"This is indeed a move forward," said Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the State Department would probably postpone any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after the next year's election, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision.
In his written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support.
1,700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow through it every day.
Six states will have to cross this path.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work crews that estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on the pipeline.
However, lawmakers in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the watery layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study, ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but the source from the energy industry said that the inspector general from the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study and focused mainly on two questions.
One time it was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, did not constitute a conflict of interest in the programme.
Next, whether the company that was hired to carry out the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making her toddler throw up in fear.
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan house and scared their daughter into throwing up.
The performance of the songwriter "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personal changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," claims her family in a suit filed against Manhattan's Supreme Court.
On November 10th last year, stage engineer Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk met with her luggage down to the lobby of their house in the part of Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a while and put the baby away for a while.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got mad and started talking dirty - loudly shouting the dirtiest words...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started splashing water on me.
He says Genevieve's had a hysterical attack.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter." "the mother of the child said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort, who subsequently dragged her into a waiting car, testified to Roseanna Monk.
Meanwhile, my daughter screamed so much she threw up, she said.
Later, the family sent a letter asking for an apology from LaBelle, but they did not receive any answers.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesperson do not respond to our calls to comment on the entire case.
The lawsuit calls for undefined damages, but family counsel, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to spend all the money spent on a charity organization dedicated to children with cancer.
"The aim is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in his arms."
The climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of the reign of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and unreliableness increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell, and the economy with them too.
This is the first year of the reign of Mario López Valdez, which is called the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations as regards economic progress, however, due to adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year no growth was recorded and even the main economic development indicators have fallen.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the potential for growth in the state economy, caused a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first semester of this year, a historical decline of 31,16% in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors as well.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded at 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78,03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21,07% were found partial damage.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the state's unemployment rate increased during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa were not employed, representing an unemployment rate of 4,53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August average unemployment continued to increase and reached 6,19%, which represents approximately 74 000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, the Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at public policy level.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is linked to various factors, including loss of liquidity on the market due to the limitations of resources due to legislation approved by Congress in the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn, invest or use them," he stressed.
Stopping migration
López Cervantes said that the demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both because of difficult entry and because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. People therefore stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is growing," he said.
Uncertainty
The labour market analysis in Sinaloa is also worsening because of the growing unreliableness prevailing in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed people in the state work without paying social security benefits.
Other features of the labour market, such as low salaries, are added to unemployment and unreliableness. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries from all over the country, as reported by the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Labour Secretariat and social planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was by September 5,352 pesetas, far below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment over the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment amounted to $630 697 in the period from January to June, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5 143 312 in the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government lists investments amounting to 17 280 million pesetas per year, which were mainly directed to companies in the field of services.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of that state asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. By November no profits were recorded from debt, namely in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Mario López Valdés, pointed out a lack of government leadership.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011, there was no reconciliation of the will of individual sectors, including the government of the state itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012 we must double our efforts, the harmonisation of all of us's efforts and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better" he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as freezing at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and reduced its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore the dynamics that would enable us to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services.
Re-defining the mission
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, president of the Intermediary Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state into more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally observe that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be drawn up in which the objectives and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources Sinaloa has is mobilised" he said.
The Work Before Us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of identifying a vision of the future that would better manage the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress with regard to the management of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted for 8 kg marijuana
Navolano was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a health threat offence, specifically for possession of marijuana for business purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 during a walk on the street Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in El Castillo, Nakalo.
Dealer drove in a pick-up-white van with a black bag in the shelf and a small backpack on the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kg 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the second department and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impacts of Crimes.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Save public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk that they will not be brought to an end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work had so far gone forward, the government of the state is now threatening not to be able to secure the relevant supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. By this time only the Federation and the city have supplied the resources for the work, so it is possible that there will be delays in the implementation of the projects.
"They are supposed to secure almost 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we did not get anything at all. Even though we should have gotten a part already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started the projects and continue very successfully, but we lack money".
He stated that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padillo, the state failed to deliver the necessary supplies, and that is why at the beginning of the new period the city had to ask for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million that the government had not given them.
"The same thing happened to us during the previous six years, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get resources to cover what did not finish the state," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise by state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that a request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, to speed up the proceedings and to arrive as soon as possible with the corresponding percentages.
"They were to provide us with 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso yet."
The Court of Justice approves the "end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogue signals by digital means is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional suit brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "off-the-line signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree stating the various steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected because a qualified majority of the eight votes needed to enable the court to comment on the constitutionality or inconstitution of the aforementioned decree, which thus remains valid.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of all questions relating to radio and television is a matter which is legally reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein leading to the transition to digitalisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into discussion of the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure measures through general standards to prepare the public administration.
"I do not think that even if she did this, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is a federal executive who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogue digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio-electric spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitalisation, which requires a decision on public interest, because digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "touches on economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he pointed out, these questions "need an operation of the whole system in place, in line with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences conferred by the Constitution into the hands of the government of the state."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and did so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it is not possible for the government to introduce a dissenting decree which, to some extent, interferes with the powers of the Congress, introduce into the administration the observance of laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 out of 6074 electoral districts have not been calculated.
The possibility of adding "voice by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, in line with the figures published by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's elections is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been counted by the votes of 879 out of the 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Election Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, 9 November, the electoral body approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not officially confirm his political constitution or his State Election Code or the Act on Election Justice, because the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was to expire during this parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish them within the prescribed time limit in the Official Journal Act, stating that he had any objections to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the Head of State's vote on constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because it has no right to "or approve or veto" them.
Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal replied to the question of the possibility of adding "voice by vote' to the IEM General Council that it would be possible for the local electoral body to carry out both partial and total censuses.
In this way, a partial census of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be carried out under the following conditions: electoral results do not agree; there is no record of a census of votes and a calculation in the appropriate box or is not available to the President; or if errors have been made and obvious violations of electoral results.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential election winner and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever there is an explicit request from the party's representative and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in second place at the beginning of the session.
The overall recalculation of votes will also be possible if, after a proper addition, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has finished second place, in which case the voting packages for which partial addition has been made will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP there is a difference between the first and second places of less than 0.16%, although 129 of the 923 electoral districts have not yet been added up.
His will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirmed by his family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a festive ceremony and a memorial service.
According to the family, the colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honor, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital city of Coahuila on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where also family and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., there was a farewell at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school high school classmates and members of a team of American football, which Felipe Bacio was also a member of at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. This is what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family. "
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and entered the flight school of Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, " barely came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo. "
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked most in his life: flying.
They gave him one last goodbye
Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, said goodbye to all the honours that came to him by Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican air force itself, leaders and students of the Saltillo Technology High School, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after a helicopter fell, which he was driving. On board was also Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and another six persons, all officials of this state.
At 18:05 the remains of Saltilen's native Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be transmitted through the funeral service to the Mexican air forces under the direction of Major Jaime Martinez on the grounds where, meanwhile, a family gathered, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented the media with 11 people who were detained in this area for organised crime crimes.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting at different parts of the body and the head were found at the abandoned farmhouse of Cadereyta Jimenez, Nuevo León.
It was found on a 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the beige-coffee fence cottage had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person wore a sports shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and wasn't worn. Next to him was a man also lying in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further there was the body of another person dressed in red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them lay face down to the ground.
According to the data collected at the scenes, all three persons were likely murdered in a different location because bullets weren't found.
On the fence of the cabin were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime others and also a number of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects were apprehended in Cadereyt.
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons among whom are also teenagers, who were members of a criminal group, which operated mainly in the area of Cadereyta and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecutions and illegal burials.
According to the information published on the first attempt on 11 November in Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one person was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
The next raid took place on 12 November at 6 o'clock. Military personnel were on a roundabout in the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when they noticed a car without a license plate and in it two persons.
After stopping the car, they did a search and discovered one rifle, a shell casing, and 18 rounds.
Then, based on these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was detained on 13 November around 14 hours. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country above the abyss of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that is holding this country above the abyss of economic disaster and which has put the entire eurozone in danger.
The Presidential Palace has issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti has stated that he will present to the President the results of his talks with the political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase" said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis that has brought debt levels to an unsustainable level.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard package of austerity measures that European leaders require, and that is the only way to restore Italy's hacked credibility.
Monti is under a lot of pressure to hurry. Due to market instability, the interest on the Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told journalists after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly multiplied by the support from PDL Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the middle-right party, told journalists.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because up until now, a number of its members have opposed the government with the technocratic majority that Monti is building.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have strong support for Parliament in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in a given effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Foreign Bank Association has joined pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women organisations on Monday.
The round will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitan on Sunday, who made it possible to move very quickly in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the interest of Italian bonds returned to the critical limit and thus respond to the uncertainty that the new Prime Minister would reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt amounts to 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the possibilities of the euro area's current financial reserves.
Monti stated that his government should remain in power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the general forecasts that claim that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then announce early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts in order to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has come to because of financial pressure.
Political sources have stated that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures in government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 called players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly game at 3:05 p.m. at San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of A-class inter-selection matches, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman's defender, who was the only one who played 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in Starfights and in powerful clubs of the English First League, have maintained intensive activity over a year at league championships and home cups and high-level matches within European cups such as Champions League.
To the previous, we also need to add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches for the European and world championships.
On the contrary, Costa Rican players have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that Iker Casillas, the goaltender who made it to the former goaltender Andoni Zubizarret last Saturday before England (losing 0-1 in London), made it to 126 international matches.
Casillas will now take on Costa Rica and will gain a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches in his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of matches on their account. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and medium attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
A hundred came close to Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
Following Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Uman move left wing Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goaltender Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Further, only 5 surpassed 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moral has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side he has the most hits Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his tour on the occasion of the celebrations of 20 years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the possibility of playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what the bass player and founding member of Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and on Sunday 20 will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will perform from 19:30 at the National Stadium along with the angel group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample from an interview whose entire transcript can be found on the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican supporters it's a dream come true Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The road to Costa Rica is our dream, which is becoming a reality.
In South and Central America, we've barely had a second time, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I'm asking because they literally love the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your rockiest supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have taken place within a few weeks.
We did some great shows in Sao Paulo and hope that we got into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there's no limit to what we can't do.
We will try to perform the best show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat a repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them, and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it already.
So the show is more interesting to us, and that's why I think it's more interesting to people.
You're celebrating 20 years of artistic career with this tour.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could imagine being in one big rock band and staying in it for more than 20 years, sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and are moved that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky we can look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group where all the greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, there will be a group in the city, but it is far less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and it's an honor to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and second, the fact that we're constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this, we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone sufficient freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I think it couldn't be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance.
We try not to tour too much because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you gave her, you can't let yourself get carried away by being famous rock stars, and neither of us ever really cared.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and in the beginning it was something spectacular.
We were a band for three years, and we never released any album until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure working with him, laughing, talking about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be assigned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the opening act?
Yes, production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter in person?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's adding the first thing that comes to mind.
Who's affecting you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
My first thought is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it's no longer fashionable?
I think we've all always felt easy to separate from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time, and if music is valid today, it's something great because it's music that's worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music than ever.
At the beginning your music had a slightly grim character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting, because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very bleak, although they may sound positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're deep dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or your boyfriend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make bleak music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss, suffering from lower limbs, informed by his attending physician.
The 72 - year - old Fujimori, serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has caused him to be operated four times and is under the control of doctors.
Member Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television station that Fujimori will undergo tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he is hurting and why he loses strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, however the former president himself does not wish mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times because of tongue cancer, lost 18 kg, and other problems were added as severe erosion gastritis, a cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor named it.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguya community living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office published on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be eliminated from the international community, and this statement raised a negative position by Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to specify fiscal exchange agreements with a view to getting out of the "black charter" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries have not implemented all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month to all shops around the world has been created from the beginning to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses" said a journalist specializing in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of a video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this medium" because until now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptation of existing titles.
Speaker Nintendo said that in addition to being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can start the "second round" at the levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose the real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and "do not succumb to optical deception."
This new entry of Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays into tune with those who watch and repeat the successful formula from the previous parts. It consists in the fact that a bearded man's plumber will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, around, in disguises and also among enemies, Luigi will also appear "playful."
Colom has approved the release of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken action on the issue of the extradition of former President Alfons Portillo, to be held accountable in the United States for conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process that aimed at Guatemala's response to the request of the northern country requesting the release of Portillo so that it could be judged.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of judicial and executive powers and that he was aware that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he "did not intervene" in court decisions and allowed all the editions that came to his desk.
Apart from Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means the move of execution after all the judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to lead the trial against the former president, who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent of the embezzlement of 120 million in the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and returned the case to play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not find themselves on the outskirts of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of social support organisation Trinijov is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion were helped, and the organisation has helped them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this end, a long 100 jobs that have been acquired for this social group should be added.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of the festive act, which took place in the former factory premises of Fabra and Coats and attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijové was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, struggling with drug addiction, or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unity of the work done by Trinijov.
Along with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current ecological-socialist Councillor Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra and Coats was also attended by the current advisor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created in a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but he added that the work that the association has brought to this day is "a good foundation."
The President has set Trinijov as an example of how it can be fought against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was an eviction of the sheltered house where giant parties were held
Intruders have acquired 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupations left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
Everything suggests that the nightmare experienced by neighbors of number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people volunteered to leave the building yesterday at noon, which they illegally inhabited, where they organized gigantic parties that woke the neighbors, leaving the building by court order, and without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation, the door lock was replaced to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," declared the administrator.
The occupiers who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest of them inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments hosted huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europa Press that sales fell by 80% while the building was occupied.
The disco owner emphasizes that the building's occupations were unfairly competitive because they were selling drinks for 3 euros, whereas the disco is worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbor's actions because of noise, but the problems were not caused by the visitors to the disco but by the residents of the house, and especially by those who attended the parties that were held here, whose frequency and intensity increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the neighborhood.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and forgave her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that they received more complaints from neighbors over the past few weeks about the situation.
Last week, the chair of the City Group of the People's Party of PP at City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded that "the building be immediately evicted and the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area" were put to an end.
The chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor had been taken over a summer ago, but in recent months, the occupiers have reached all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and even thefts have occurred in one of them.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against the civil responsibility that took place in the building. "
Yesterday the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock, 30 minutes later, the police reached building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four of them were apprehended immediately.
Park or mountains?
The architects gathered on the occasion of the proceedings, which carry more than polemics regarding fees
The municipal tender for 16 gates once again opens up a debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the biggest boom of the already extinct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that are not oriented north - south, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of Yogi bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega contest consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate is recording more of a park idea.
It's either this, or someone's trying to place the gate in the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and on the basis of reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona's architects.
It's already a subject as timid as when two members of this old caste chosen to meet in the elevator shake hands.
And it was this act that sparked one of the rare matches between what three Barcelonan architects and pre-conceived university professors think.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender has its reasons.
According to Roldan, after the question of the bay side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain party" too, so Ildefons Cerd's speech on green apples was not brought to an end.
"We must build on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect for whom the name "gates to Colliserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as the definition of zones where it can operate".
Modol, like Roldan and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers."
The danger arising from the "uncertainty that is now represented by the public space project" after the experience of the 1980s, which had "its swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Something to define means to take the next step," that is, in principle, to move one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we look more closely at the question, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered as a park" but not the Barcelona part, for reasons of purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Colliserola, who "may not end up in the junkyard" although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its grémia that it will intervene in the project from "the first moment."
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of culprit that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "doubtful" that it should be this technical profile that will be led by multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills," he adds), which need to be created: "Architects should only be instruments."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex because Collserola's global vision is missing in the tender documents: "16 competitions have been announced that deal with all the axes of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study to look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This causes at least him to sign up for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may run into the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the town hall should ensure that the zone located immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should ensure a full length of equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and greenery.
The casino pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, Legal Agent Cadino Red pardoned the mayor's brother Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal agent Casino Red pardoned him before the Second Criminal Court in the district in question, discussing the blackmail case in which the mayor's brother Monterrey was charged.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas was supposed to ask him to pay for an economic quota to allow the City Hall of Monterrey to operate illegally in a betting house.
After the state prosecutor's public prosecution, he started prosecuting the brother of the mayor. On September 2 he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then after spending four hours in front of Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
In this place, he remained for the next 49 days after the second arrest order was issued and the Public Ministry's agent denied the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with an amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in a prison with moderate supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who stated that after nearly two months of investigation, enough evidence was collected to prove Jonas' guilt, such as payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be made possible.
This Monday, the legal agent of the Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came to judge José Luis Pecin and asked for a pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region. On this basis, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the associates had decided to grant a pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazabal. In the proceedings against him, no complaint can be filed.
After the trial with the legal officer around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón.
The court's secretary, Jorge Yanez, came to San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonas that he had been given official pardon and his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also told him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details about the accident in which the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and the other seven persons died show that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for Communication and Transport, said that prior to the start of the aircraft the pilot stated that climate conditions allow the flight.
"Parts that appear suggest that the unit has come into contact several times with the terrain, the wings have been tangled into the branches of trees 25 meters from where the unit has lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore it met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground following an investigation conducted in the field of impact.
"In the search it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located in another place, so the plane crashed into the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 people, meeting all requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of between seven and thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is most important to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, stated that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at a cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal flight operation," he said.
At a press conference, Deputy SCT Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was implemented according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at the start, according to which the aircraft progresses towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds the crew searched for a lower area and greater visibility up to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the trajectory of the flight before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft residue in restricted territory:
The information currently available allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a flat trajectory and from the side.
The sketch of the dispersal of the remains of the aircraft indicates that the helicopter was solid at the time of impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident to indicate that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During field work, the aircraft remains were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the slopes go from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show images where the route was likely to disintegrate along the route.
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have made contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search into the vicinity of the accident, in a territory that is larger than the territory of the setting, no helicopter remains were found, which strengthens the assumption that the impact occurred in a state where the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance started research into a gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents. Research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research entitled "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Youths" will allow for results related to overweight.
In a report by the head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team was established composed of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.
This team is based on the support of specialists and students of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can also participate in research by the general public with or without permissions. People can come to the participating sports centers of the IMSS in Valle de México, where every Saturday at 8 o'clock will be tested by teenagers.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East Mexican State).
Once the data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (South of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics as regards the development of obesity, and to track down risk factors for Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants take anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, and genes are studied (see genes involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects health care concerns over the alarming increase in child weight.
'The medical surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that only six years later, the boys had increased obesity by 77% and 47% in girls.
He stated that one reason for finding indicators is the belief that the population of the country is different from other populations by its genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the general genetics of obesity are commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the condition of children, thus establishing whether they exhibit any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of wrinkles of dark color (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the probability that the individual would suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar states.
The information is so far confidential, the doctors transmit it to their parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make in order to avoid disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life, meaning a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of television all day, and using means of transport instead of walking at short distances.
Overweight also causes a large calorie intake, i.e. a larger consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and a genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in Asphalt of the UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, independent of climate conditions and temperature
If pavement was properly cared for, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each period of rain in the Metropolitan region of Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or it would even be possible to completely remove them.
In his lecture, the technological cause of potholes, which he gave within the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his guidance was developing modified asphalt with polymers, thereby producing a mixture with similar characteristics to asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing pothole formation.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a large molecular mass called asphalten, and others with a low molecular mass called mortars. Together they provide asphalt with a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost firm, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, the expert warned about chemical engineering.
A scientist at the Chemical Faculty observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, three of which last are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is the asphalt insert, made of small stones in tarmac and then compressed.
He pointed out that every stone that makes up an insert is covered with asphalt.
During the passage of cars or when creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the pavement to decompose well.
If it was modified asphalt, it would decompose even better, it considers a chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer called a cloak, consisting of fine stones, i.e. sand also embedded in asphalt, would be placed on the asphalt insert.
As this layer will come into contact with the rims of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt liner and ensure road friction.
As a part of the tiling, the mantle must be of sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to be remembered. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt liner.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it is hard to get out, it causes the softening of all layers of pavement and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that during the pothole formation, the film will be damaged first and then damage the asphalt liner. However, the damage does not occur in one moment, but it is a slow process that should stop at the first signs by using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each single layer of pavement must correspond to the load of vehicles and it must be ensured that this load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that we still have a lot of work to do with asphalt and research at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions are worth mentioning, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow us to repair potholes easily without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
So Valle gets the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca again has not reached the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that she found herself on the stage of the winner, gained a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multimiss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's finale in Cartagena, in which she won and the scepter took Miss Atlántico, the said department won the 14th multi-mission title. Melina thus joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca, who reached the winning crown, but eventually were declared the first multi-miss. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the great favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she had the power to become the new Miss Colombian, and not in vain became the Queen of Police and the prettiest face of Joel de Volgue. These titles were achieved by, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title Miss Colombian.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury had only decided to appoint her is the First Multimiss, the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like best and why?", which one was put by Martín Murillo Gómez from Leamos literary editorship.
The candidate answered the question:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in childhood was "The Little Prince," a very deep book.
I am currently reading "crime and punishment." It is a book that is part of a worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre."
This response did not like it because of the term "culturalize" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain to her what the individual books said.
After the ceremony Melina declared that she was calm and delighted with the result: "The world is wise what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The little prince is a beautiful book."
One other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
Bogotian journalist suggested that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who received all previous prizes (Gastronomical challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then failed on the scene.
This was evident at the first presentation of the swimsuit on the beach of Hilton and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she was shining on both of them, it was clear that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Like Home" program at Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's first multimiss title confirms that the candidate who won the most titles during the competition doesn't eventually leave with the crown of the queen."
Moreover, in recent days, Valle has been rather unkind to the media, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
On the margins, two days before the election, an international jury member named Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before entering the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was evident on her butt. This is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which elected her Miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on her butt, which, in my opinion, was not very noticeable, reduced her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, a journalist named Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that a family member from Valle made a mistake in undergoing several surgical procedures.
"The surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here it took its toll."
Because of this award, which was first given to the National Beauty Assembly, there was a cruel prediction after the swimsuit show that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo allowed Melina not to finally have to give her the highest crown.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina started the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, it will be recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the thrilling success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of the Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cane.
A fingerprint expert from Cali went into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana."
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana," through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, Eliazar González, the men of Puerta Tejada, who worked for 21 years in the field of forensic research, was in turn this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at Chocó City Hall, where he often had to dig through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle, and after attending the courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. the palms of his hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against Alfonso Can, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who ran the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take a fingerprint card from Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the location of the corpse, he didn't recognize him because of his physical appearance.
He didn't have a beard, he was dressed like a villager in a given area, no glasses, much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, ink, transplanter, and light Eliazar began to compare the dead corpse with the card entries.
The eye didn't disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was assigned to confirm to Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzon, whether it was really Chief Farc.
Track Search
For the Sijin de Cali Daktyloscope, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of operational service against "Can" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, these people are helping to investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present fake IDs or don't have papers at all.
We're gonna take their fingerprints, and we're gonna look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of injury, he had to remove a piece of the house's wall, because in this place the thief leaned to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we could get a full-hand print and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts", recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicion in a murder case.
Not long ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members might be responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although there is no 100% confirmation that he really was a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of a crime.
The fingerprint expert at CTI explained that the objects were "shaded by chemical or physical reactive substances'.
When it appears, a transplanter or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians, whose data are not recorded anywhere," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it turns out in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything that glitters isn't gold, not everything you touch remains trace.
However, where it can be used, appropriate comparisons shall be made.
"The Outrage" is protesting in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were crowded in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large number of them were waiting for orders to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
On Tuesday, members of the Wall Street movement provoked representatives of New York City to try and re-enter Manhattan Square from where they were escorted in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of Protestants were crowded in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allows the "enraged" to return to camp on site. The second part of the movement responded to the vacation by taking up a park in the north of the city where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through meetings and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Seize Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "enraged " to the eviction of the camp, ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the site and allowing the manifestists to continue camping here.
In addition, another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the site of the parish in Trinity Church, took over the "outrage. "
At least for an hour they managed to take up the place, but then the police came and detained some of the manifestants. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw that they put the cuffs on some journalists as well.
The organization assures that several hundred people settled on the site, and a delegation of religious leaders came to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed, and a court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the transferred manifestants even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave it to those who guarded the square, which caused "some small clashes" Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers beat the manifestans.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using "laws that were published after the trial began, or from prohibiting manifestants from accessing the park with shops or other places they had previously used" sites.
Mayor Bloomberg said for the press that, given this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of the public space and the manifestants have warned that local laws do not allow them to return to tents and sleeping bags.
The city's highest representative personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation that detained 200 people and to which it was approached because the manifestants "betrayed the law."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to evacuate because it became "a place where people did not protest, but break the laws and in some cases hurt others" because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared for the quality of their lives."
"The morning cleanup was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added the spokesperson of the movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they plan to organise "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate two months of protest, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present Our Lady on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear in the TV programme "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," lifeguard in "Baywatch," bunny in "Playboy," wife of the year musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Our Lady on a special Christmas show of Canadian television.
Today, a private TV station CTV announced that Anderson, along with a singer of sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the TV programme "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage of a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the engine of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding in the nursery representing Jesus.
As Josef, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, has recently been a presenter on the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer Bublé appears on a special Christmas CTV broadcast, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is rising by 1.5% due to household consumption, ending with the fall period that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of Tokyo's governments estimated material losses at $300,000, a blow that, despite a difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of falls, the GDP value between July and September was in such a position that it was possible to definitely turn the page: GDP increased by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - the tax year begins in March 2012 for the Japanese - expect the biggest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The revival can be partly explained by buying machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the period January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of Japan's economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get stronger out of it, or to restore infrastructure.
Japan has awakened, especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Flows were entrusted to the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "save values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July until September to the yen course.
While markets continue to surround the outermost countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," said the Minister of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts inflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even got below the average, which is located at the level of 100. It got to the level of 99,13 points.
Athens Again Spreads Insecurity
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky margin guarantees and the uncertainty that has once again prevailed, Greece is becoming increasingly involved in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "coincidence" of the new transitional Greek government is given more to Brussels than to the genuine conviction of political forces is being confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days he was given at his appointment would probably be short for their application, Chairman of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures would in no way support and reiterated his request to launch new elections on the expected date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote on government trust.
The 24 programme package to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not shed any light on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have no further commitment. "
The chairman of the Conservatives has gone a little far in his speech to the EU, and the IMF is supposed to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but at the same time he has stated that he will not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, already upset by the impact that caused Papandrea to play with the referendum, pointed out yesterday that its demands are unstoppable: it will not block any assistance unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and discuss with the new government "what they need to pay the sixth part" of 8 billion. However, the definitive date does not exist.
The Greek spinner has so little to confuse.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain has "achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance'.
Yesterday, Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is that "it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is an instrument based on trust in man."
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th global micro-loan summit in Valladolid, believing that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, the amount that sets the poverty threshold."
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly" highlighted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will provide for the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women" to whom these loans are intended first and foremost.
"We have achieved many things" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The micro-loan summit should not only be a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic objectives."
Her Majesty explained that the aim is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to be above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-borrowing spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "the pioneer of Muhammad Yunus " stated the Queen and added that it was "an act of righteousness and a necessary recognition. "
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who set out to fight poverty " 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to become acquainted with his lending policy on the spot.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to state the constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned yesterday the title "head of the family" which gave her "the movement of the poor" in Valladolid.
Queen Sofia ended her speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions and thus enabling them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, has stated that solidarity is an "ethical imperative" that all democratic states must abide by.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balohoby, because this cooperation is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jimenez believes that micro-borrowing is a 'serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty', and now more than ever the governments of developed countries must work in line with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-borrowing is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates a concept based on giving confidence to the people everyone else is closing the door to. Mayor Valladolida, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in a city that "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of universal electoral rights
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU) took place on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, without serious difficulties for Chancellor and Chair of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it was only in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow to the Italians as lax.
The proposal on the President of the European Commission submitted by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates were opposed and 10 delegates abstained.
Several aminuts standing up at the end of Angela Merkel's performance and then several hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The principal idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe but more Europe."
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time for change" has come.
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon, enabling the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission under universal electoral law "in order to give Europe one face".
Such is in any case one of the ideas of the draft adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: Great Britain is opposed, and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which clearly results in a strengthening of Germany's weight.
The Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she was not trying to get a congress talking about the "small" European states or the states that are in trouble, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she reminded me that just 200 years ago, there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon army.
What is involved in incapacity for work?
Following the aid, the UMP party and the government offensive are launching anti-work incompetence.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15th and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will address a speech on the topic recurring since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As a follow-up to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start taking aid in sickness.
Clearly, without the company's approval, an employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing many bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
It is also a measure that would be accompanied by further symbolic measures: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no incompetence compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority is also launching a theme of fraud aimed at crimes linked to work incompetences this time.
"Controls will be much larger, plus: if caught, you will be returning," said Xavier Bertrand during an interview provided by RTL on Sunday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about iniquities in work incapacity.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political upheaval that produced their fruitage.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladia (CNAM) more than 237 million euro daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, daily compensation with its 11.3 billion euro accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity benefits and accidents at work, and 54% concerned occupational incapacity, i.e. 6,2 billion euro.
Only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which contains certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the Monster.com job opportunities website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed replied that it had not chosen any day of incapacity.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37,8% of the incapacity for work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
By comparing them with their European neighbours, French employees are not more prone to work incompetence than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in work incompetence is a very small part compared to working in black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are small-scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks aimed at incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that at 1.5 million checks, 13,8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term failures of "incorrect or too long', i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetences of more than 45 days, 11% of "inadapted or unauthorized" cases were counted to 1,2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unwarranted" cases for several million employees who have had incapacity to work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work on black.
According to Mr Dominique Tian, author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euro missing from tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words before Parliament and added that a hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
"In order to rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget plan," said the government's chief when he made his first public speech on Wednesday at the opening of the debate to vote on trust in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the eurozone summit will be "the main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is in play, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product from now to the end of the year after it was 10,6% in 2010 and 15,7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, the leader of the right, Antonis Samaras, expressed his support for the already approved measures in order to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party was not committed to any additional austerity measures.
'We will not raise our hand for any new measures', Samaras stressed at the meeting with Members for his side of New Democracy.
We have agreed on targets for reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for the Economy and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without the written guarantee of all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the expert committee
According to the Royal Canadian Society's report, Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, involving six experts working in various fields of ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends the Government to amend criminal law in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
In the beginning, experts quote the recent survey of the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada has ranked 10th, the study notes that the "medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in Quebec, this number is the highest with 86% of the deceased in the hospital.
Regarding the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that they do not want to change anything about the law of euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also controlled all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered to be criminal cases, there is no evidence that this decriminating causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons not competent or disagreeable.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than a number of cases of these misconceptions yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal"
"Asisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal" explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an investigation conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken for euthanasia because they believe it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out a message that the life of old or handicapped persons is worth less.
With regard to persons who are involved in assisted suicide, 41% of respondents consider that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear about maintaining or interrupting care for the patient, says the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that the withdrawal from treatment for which a legally confirmed refusal exists is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires that professional doctors be educated to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their lives without fear of prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final calming already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission requests that it be considered as euthanasia at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society's expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signers of the report as "extreme" among other things because he does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be more than 18 years old could ask to be helped to commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the rhesumic reports yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report have built autonomy of the person over all other values that shape the social pre-eminence of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
The medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifest for euthanasia'.
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society herself, doubts in particular about the data of the report concerning the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the American State of Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus talks about "complot."
Syria's getting more isolated
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad showed up yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists and talks about a "complot" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, adopted an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordanian King Abdelah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to kill about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces in Syria,"he handed over power."
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian regime had not been crowned with success since the beginning of the year.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is applying an ever-harder line.
The United States rejoiced at the "enhancing consensus against Assad and the dishonesty of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are applying an ever harder tone" to repression in Syria, Mark Toner, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, remarked.
As announced by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of pro-regime forces died in Deraa, South Syria during that time.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in gunfights and concentrated gunfire in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, during the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualle estimated that the country had taken a road out of the crisis.
After all, he also responded lively to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus's membership, which, in his view, constitutes a "dangerous move."
Syria "doesn't bow," he added with assurance that "complots against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering the "mechanism of civil protection" and is planning to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also favors the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is "paranoid."
The new special meeting of the League is called for tomorrow to Rabat to take a stand on the plan to resolve the crisis that was decided on 2 December, in which the withdrawal of armies from the cities plagued by strife and the liberation of imprisoned manifestants was envisaged in particular.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the Arab League's decision to be "faulty" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but the support for possible sanctions against Damascus was completely avoided.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice for Italians
The next head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will contain "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should assemble a relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the designed prime minister.
President of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation ends with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy, precise terms" apply as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, stressing and adding that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understand."
Its appointment as president was a favorable adoption of the markets at the outset, but concern reappeared after the unexpected fall in September of industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should establish a team, including, in particular, technocrats, while stressing that he would also like to adopt "politics'.
He expressed his conviction that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini's new government will have Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti, after taking up his duties, promised to act with extreme urgency and in order to make Italy a "strong link" to Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing'.
The European Union believes that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the business association Confindustria Emma Marcegagliová, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot comply with deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, the "call for seriousness" and "other Italy," represents an "eposmalous change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism."
The great unknown will be the life span of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place state bonds for 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator for an atomic weapon, announced on Tuesday an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from this UN agency.
Last week, the IAEA announced its "serious concern" with regard to the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, widely drawn from IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should work three decades from the 1960s in the Soviet military research centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he should deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the Centre was to leave Kiev to set up a company producing nano-diamonds.
The economic difficulties of his company were to bring him to contact the Irish Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian programme.
In its latest IAEA report, it points out that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked on this technology during a substantial part of his career in the military nuclear programme of the country from which it came."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes have increased by 50%.
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or little increased.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to the procedure of 13% in violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% in offenses against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crime" very slightly increased to 6.628 cases, 47.3% of which, according to the FBI, were motivated by racial differences and 20% religious differences.
"After the decline in 2009 it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and offences rise again," emphasized Human rights First's human rights organization,"the rise of anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leading officials of Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these crimes," adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "hate crime."
"Hateful crime" in US federal law is the legacy of a time of civil rights struggle.
This rule of law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The website providing microblogging services Twitter introduced changes in design on Monday to enable its users to observe the activities of successors, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New "activity" and "name" offers allow you to know better and directly the activities of other people who are watching you or those whose answers are "tweets."
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor contributions, whether they are logged in to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new Twitter face was tested on a small percentage of users in August before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP told Twitter Carolyn Penner's spokesperson.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, followfriday pour recommendr de suivre un autre utilizateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus compatible a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately assess the importance of this innovation in their "tweets."
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activation works better to help me track some of the elements of my Twitter," sent by @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entering the golden rule on a balanced budget into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided to include the "golden rule" of budgetary policy in the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid any reduction in the assessment of Austria by credit rating agencies (AA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of a ministerial meeting in a situation where Austrian public debt, with its 74.6% high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% laid down by the Maastricht Agreement, is much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced by just one single degree from AAA to AA+, we would have had to pay three billion more euros each year on interest," argued Vice Chancellor and Secretary of State, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows the request of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly asked that a reduction in the public deficit and a balance of public accounts be entered in the Constitution or into the law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model," Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and from 2017 onwards the federal state's public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal countries, as well as the municipalities, will have to have a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 horizon.
♪ Strong yen ♪
Noda is threatened with new intervention on foreign exchange markets
Japan's prime minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on foreign exchange markets if they were just to continue strengthening.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, explained to the senate Y. Nod.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to reduce the value of Japan's currency, which had only recently surpassed the dollar record since 1945.
But only since then has he regularly stepped up by buying investors who consider him a "safe harbor" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar was again below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of Japan's currency is detrimental to island exports as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues obtained by Japanese foreign companies when they transfer them to their domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku in the northeast of the country, emphasized Y. Noda, who fears that the price increase of the yen would not kill a fragile recovery in the egg.
The third economic power of the world renewed growth in the third quarter (1.5% relative to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of growth in exports and household consumption burdened by disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on Japan's Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But Hirohide Yamaguchi's vice-governor pointed out that BoJ had already taken 'obligatory measures' indicating that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Issues Institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euro) and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Euro area:
The rates are rising, the stock exchanges are failing
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
Europe's exchanges are still concerned about the stability of the euro area today on Tuesday, November 15, are falling into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 o'clock index CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"With the new tensions about the income from eurozone borrowings that are in trouble, the stock markets around the world continue to pay only part of the recent profits."
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closing down by 0.7%, which it suffered due to market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the exchange will continue only in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilised" estimates Mitsushige Akino, the fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-starting of the eurozone's future uncertainty is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is worth $1.3570 at a withdrawal rate of 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency backed back after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at her congress on Monday expecting the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries that are in trouble without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds amounts to 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen market participants' concerns.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has strongly demanded time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the eurozone summit would be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when elections to the Chamber of Deputies are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference between 10-year bonds between Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting euro area growth numbers
Statistical figures say that France recorded a growth rate of 0.4% in the third quarter due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downward figures for the second quarter to a decrease of 0,1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And actually, it's the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
From its side during the same period, Germany registered an increase of 0,5%.
The first estimates for the whole euro area are expected at 11 o'clock, while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that occupies the core energy.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will trigger a duplication of demand for electricity from now to 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, an issue that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
An accident in Fukushima doesn't affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case with Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which it considers right to build only power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant crash.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected by an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will experience all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of its electricity is derived, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which makes CO2 emissions and prices of Danish electricity higher by 65% or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity invoice 40% higher than the amount of the French household payment.
While energy costs in a globalised economy are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry in national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of Europe's cheapest electricity.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusionary beautiful statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has enabled a sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 follow-up jobs to be built.
The strong-exporting sector is dragging a large number of small and medium-sized specialised jobs that cannot be transferred abroad to international markets.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lost 6 billion euros a year for exporting nuclear facilities and services.
What kind of power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while its manufacturer's bankruptcy was planned?
When dealing with the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, or that there is no evil.
The development of low CO2 emission plants, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations implemented by the French AREVA industrial group demonstrates complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, the absolute need to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is respected, have the idea of blood safety.
Fifty years later, the nuclear industry saw three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island happened in normal traffic conditions and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused reactor concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lesson from this accident as it did with the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the competitors of AREVA and EDF and releasing their way to take the lead in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogma and machination dominate the debate so crucial to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy implemented under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the flooding of the police, courts and administrations subjected to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights' that France boasts.
Recently, it was administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students, who became current when the Minister of Interior (see the May 23 newspaper Libération) stated that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses."
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at an economic angle.
It must be said that there is quite a broad consensus in this area between the left and the right.
Tone to the right in 1976, Jacques Chirac declared that "90,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and Michel Rocard on the left when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are willing to give to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande limits itself to banality when it states that common developments will enable us to solve our "migration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
Reducing immigration is crippling growth and harming employment.
Fears of the effects caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less skilled, and are putting pressure on their wages to decrease.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more supplemental than substitutes for French employees by doing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these additions between the French and migrants cause the arrival of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
In Europe, migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average, of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany, one immigrant coming at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) to public budgets for the rest of his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his desire to go for the missing percentage of growth "with your teeth in."
The mentioned teeth used to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we have to think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember that, even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, holocausts, gulags, but also Franca in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece during the XXth century.
Some people could have believed that it would be enough to make the choice and make it in the most direct way possible for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
General electoral law, although a necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can become a means of oppression, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been that way and since the beginning of the crises in politics and democracy.
Admitting the mistake of a Greek referendum of the type yes-no will have the value of double detection in this regard: revealing the need for a great return of political power, but also revealing the disturbing sense of its impossibility, its unsuitability.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganised.
Bianko exposed to a European absolutistic monarch or jumping with his feet tied into the void of nationalist depth: what choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want the Guillotine knives, but the common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop the list - because there is a crisis in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that bows to the dictation of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European democratic sovereignty project urgently needs to be restored.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the government of markets and invest in preparing the future.
The exit from the crisis will be expected by decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it will lead us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly demanding a European economic government.
So be it.
But thinking this without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to form a Republic in France, it was necessary to be Republicans.
Revolutions in interests couldn't do it.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards spread
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world trade fair of chip cards will open in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should end with an increase in world sales of cards with microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% on more than 6 billion units.
The most important is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in bulk transport or to handle purchases by simply zooming the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After being in the lift of APEC countries for a long time, Europe acquires the terrain in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 uncontacted Visa cards have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to rank a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute bank cards to their clients systematically in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing cell phone payments
But this is only the first stage to the payment means of the future: the mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for carrying out transactions today is equipped with only a small number of instruments.
"They're running late."
"But their real boom should happen next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales of between 80 and 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Last night, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, the Société Générale announced yesterday that it was preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
The Terrorist Front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the alliances between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are ties between the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had become certain about this from now on.
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by members of the AQMI from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation conducted by special French units.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of the calls made leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other leads to a man known to be close to AQMI and sect.
"This is progress, but we must no doubt wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active", the moderate statements made by Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "aids" have been more and more evident in the development and expression of Boko Haram or in its operating procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same way as those used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community on the forehead with Washington has put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has created.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little good interest.
Fast Success
The sect of Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, meaning "Western education is a sin," approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The cult is politicised and requires strict respect for Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are launching a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram's supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks against police stations.
The government's response is still the same as usual.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group has radicalized and abandoned its assignment in the north.
On Christmas 2010, Jos will carry out an assassination in which 80 people will die, then another in the capital of Abuja.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the U.N.'s local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on concerns all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda surrounded the Islamic Maghreba Mali and the iger and the Somalis of the Al-Shab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, when he interviewed President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France was in a state of emergency and is ready to "transmit all information."
The world according to presidential candidates
Both Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are overreacting in simplifying and ignorance on issues related to China, Iran, or helping Israel.
Can America's weakened crisis manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating vocal statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans of China, Iran, or Israel's aid unite among themselves.
Mitt Romney, the best placed candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party," threatened with the Chinese occupation before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "for manipulation of their currency" which is a subject in America driven by the migration of entire parts of its industry towards Asia.
The worse, if this must contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's ambassador to China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost got caught up in an emotional attitude.
He demanded a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is in the last places in election estimates, remains unheard of.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop his nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in fanfarón.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase his military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his duties toward this partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, demonstrates the awkward ignorance of documents.
Recently, it called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, because Beijing "trying to develop nuclear capacity" - the evidently ignorant fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far away from Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had some simple ideas, and yet he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses for Libya and thus attribute him to the weak
But the attack isn't easy.
The population considers President Obama's national security policy, which eliminated Ben Laden, rather positively.
He has no confidence from Iraq in military intervention that leads to watering down.
And with arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama knocks on the right place.
Nord Stream, the new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
Nord Stream's long-distance pipeline connecting directly Eastern Europe to Russia and led along the Baltic Sea began to work.
It must deliver a gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday's Nord Stream inauguration, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
In symbolic terms, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned the control around the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow every year to Western Europe by the first pipeline of 1 224 km connecting the region of St Petersburg to the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered, which is the quantity that equals the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom the early completion of this huge construction has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being run by a third State (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing a little bit of power: the possibility of pushing Russia by threatening to shut down its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact" with an appeal to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it is politically sensitive.
With its support for this Russian project, Western Europe gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created cracks between Europeans from the east and west.
Russia barely succeeded five years ago in promoting its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and wealthy Western states with high gas consumption, whose bearings are coming to an end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us" confirmed François Fillon at the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point large gas contracts of things are both political and economic.
This all explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
Undersea pipes are made of steel fitted with a concrete casing to protect them from the anchors of sea vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction it was necessary to avoid the minefields from World War II.
"For safety reasons, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, Nord Stream's spokesman.
It was also necessary to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not broken anywhere over its entire length by valves or maintenance stations.
One inspection platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see a Russian state society settling permanently off their coast.
"In case of failure we stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In case of leakage gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, for the welds were designed to cause leakage once every 100,000 years.
Checking the state of the gas pipeline from the outside is carried out by an underwater ship-drawn robot, while the inside of the gas pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the end of the three-day journey, at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline has been designed to work for 50 years without the slightest need for repair.
Circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at start and 100 bar at finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom, holding a 51% stake, remains the lead.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has its registered office in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its gas transport capacity to this company for five years by a contract that can be renewed.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of really transported gas," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, investment costs rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be refunded, because Gazprom is the only one taking the risk.
The pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves 5 feet high form the exit gate of the gas.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskin - designer notebook
The Italian company Moleskin, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to restore the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
Moleskin's notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular plates and its white-colored leaves as if over time old.
After all, Moleskin's notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo located in Milan at that time decides to market a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes up the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of leather), which is used, for example, to adjust the surface of benches.
This type of notebook has been greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
" Moleskin returned to popularity an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XXth century," relates Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle to 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskin crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to construct an artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will attract businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskin's notebook is that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian business, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now has almost a hundred, and since 2008, it has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and through a chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the centers of cities where he could assert his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, despite the turbulent development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the notebook Moleskin: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zachazka" where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, she also introduced new records of a notebook resembling a leopard.
Moleskin benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand extends to a wide range of carriers.
Success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe investment funds, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the proportion of unemployed handicapped workers so high?
Around 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
Today, the 15th week for the employment of handicapped people opens.
Despite the Voluntarist public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed handicapped persons is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the whole population.
Is it depressing?
"No, Eric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, who organizes the Week for the employment of handicapped people."
"The steps achieved in 15 years are remarkable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate wasn't twice but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be said that there are numerous obstacles for unemployed disabled people before their entry into work.
Elderly: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% of them have no graduation, and only 10,000 of the 2.3 million college students are handicapped.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for handicapped versus 38% on average.
In short, these are criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to work and which represent the "core problem", according to Christian Grapin, the CEO of the Treplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses receive handicapped workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slow.
A study by the IMS-Entrepredre pour la Cité association in April found that the surveyed managers had a "weak level of knowledge of handicapped persons" with an "exaggeration of persons in wheelchairs and mental or mental deficiencies."
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employing 6% of handicapped workers laid down in the 1987 Law.
The last known figures, which come from 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, responsible for charging businesses that do not comply with this law.
The proof is that the number of companies being fined, as well as the sums paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro), are guilty.
"The 2005 Law, which increased the contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "How lucky"
Before on Tuesday night (20h45) French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that will bring them this friendly match.
We're not going to go that far to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other at the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only the words of praise to his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," the French Lille player assures.
As regards the difference between his performance in the club matches and the national team matches," it is one and the same, it is justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Gambling, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
The term "joy" cannot be forgotten.
Play against Bleus, whom he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more so, because across the street are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ', reminds.
"We crossed each other immediately."
"The power to play against them is nothing but pleasure!"
Good-heartedly, Leekens reminded me of "hungry."
"Pride" to fight the "fight" holiday.
"Pride" also states in the quality of "neighbors" that France has become a team of very high levels a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great deal of work," he fancies.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, a technical football player would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French heading... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next games," including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento launches the barage against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way there both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. Portugal's football representation, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
One game left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's result (0-0) in Hell of Bosnian Zenica it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour's advantage, but it was unable to score such a rare goal to relieve it.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk, because we didn't score a goal out there."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisabona, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance before the audience, which should create a boiling boiler there, although the match certainly seems "very balanced," says the optimist, but keenly thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite convinced that we can have the upper hand" said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at the Euro 2012," but Carlos Queiroze's successor relativized.
Indecisive Friday's game in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for Bosnians who also need to score a goal.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score a goal out there," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualities," he added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the start, so that "they will not give them time to think."
A good idea, on condition that it turns out to be realistic this time.
