What will he do? ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the candy store
New City Councillors from ČSSD will seem to have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and in the council.
The journal Aktuálně.cz has "tested" members of the new board from ČSSD, as they know the notoriously established slang that was created at the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary introduced by Prague's political elite during the previous era by Mayor Pavel Bém describes some of the most famous characters, situations and cases in the capital.
Surprisingly, the new councillors do not understand the concepts well.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a rookie in Prague politics," said the Councillor for Culture Lukáš Kaucký on the test of "Godfather's" vocabulary.
And while he is a political veteran, Councilman Karel Březina responded similarly.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you give me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't accept slang in general."
This June before the ODS election congress, the editors selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Council.
Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort," "the biggest golf hole in Prague," "go to the candy store," "Bull necks," "Treason of the capital" and "Leave."
Three of the councilmen agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head Prague education in the future - first promised the interview, but later no longer answered the phone.
Fifth Councilman Peter Dolínek refused the test.
"I don't care about these things at all, and I'm not going to judge how civil democrats are entertained."
"I am now discussing how we will understand each other within our programs," he responded.
As has already been said, Alderman Lukáš Kaucký would not have known in the headline above that there was talk of an influential businessman and a friend of the former Prime Minister Bém Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" Kaucký is not telling him anything and the only term he correctly estimated in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
"This is Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucky, adding: "But I know more about it from the newspaper."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The Golf Hole as a tunnel Blanka decodes the administration not only matador Karel Březina, but also the environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachý is also familiar with where to find this figure - he senses the meaning of the term "go to the candy store."
"I think that means going to some Prague business," is Shy close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušk's companies.
Couple with Březina reminds us that he drew his knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
There is no similar run-of-the-mill vocabulary of slang expressions in social democracy according to the frequency test.
"I've consulted my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, abbreviations and names are sometimes used," says Petr Hulínský, Chairman of the Prague ČSSD, to whom the parties call the Hulda.
"I was called Birch at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina admits.
The journal Aktuálně.cz has tried and worked.
Councilman Weinert is for the party Grandpa or less friendly Dedek, representative of Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the election to fraud in sponsoring the party, has the nickname "Igráček" in some of his colleagues.
Aliases are also the only thing that social democrats admit in intra-party language.
Huldu is said not to like Huldu, but the journal Aktuálně.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague president.
"Doctor of baton law" says that Petr Hulínský won his JUDr. title at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches, " published a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common characters.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot engage in work for health reasons, they are single and they do not have children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation to avoid endangering the rest of the village.
"The man will rarely make this fate."
"Neither do young healthy women move away because they help work and give birth to children, " describes the order sister who takes care of more than a hundred women in a special house in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, who have expelled their communities from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to intervene against an unusual "social measure."
She published an information brochure that should help limit the witch hunt.
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso can't read," Die Standard pointed out.
Charges of witchcraft are common in other African countries as well.
Last week, in Ghana, a neighboring woman named Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72 years old, died after three women and two men tortured her, spilled kerosene and set fire to her.
The BBC server informed the case.
Perps say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was ignited with oil used for ritual anointing.
It was said to have ignited after the group wanted to "rescue the evil spirit out of the woman. "
The isolation of "witches " is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
Der Standard quoted a 42 - year - old businessman from Burkina Faso: "People's soul eaters have always posed a danger, " he said.
While the witch hunt in Burkina Faso is trying to temper the government, last year the president himself participated in the witch hunt.
"Gambian president Jammi, after his aunt's death, unleashed a large hunt for witches, supposedly to participate in her death and seek to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
"To help, he invited shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and personal security guards, violently took randomly selected men and women from the Gambi villages to the president's farm in Kanali," Amnesty International reported.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two trapped residents didn't make it to the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released to freedom.
Bakal's tenant: Heating in the stove, higher rent signed
The older sluggish man stepped out of the door of the client centre of the company RPG Apartments "uhlobaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried a file under his arm and in it new leases to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the punishment.
All three of them just had deregulation up their rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay for the 2+1 apartment of the second category 4100 crowns from next year.
"And there is no hot water, and the petram must be drowned (hard fuel stoves, note red.)," the man points with a finger in his son's new contract, for whose signature he has full authority.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called new lease terms "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7th, when it publishes instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man's just waving his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, there are a large majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
Havířovská waiting room RPG is one of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. it is already full.
There's a security guard at the security office right next door, and there's a caller at her door.
"Hire 2011" is lit by a special button on its touch screen.
One tap and a piece of paper comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your cipher is already beeping on the big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're up in half a second.
After a while, an older married couple comes to ask about the rent, but the crowd in the waiting room clearly does not concern new rents.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance events, etc.
Letters with new lease contracts in Ostrava are sent to the mailboxes by tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio from around mid-November.
The RPG Apartments propose an increase of between 15 and 38 percent in their letters.
The special partition for new rents was opened on November 18th at the client centre.
"It runs over a week, so it's only in the run," the worker behind the counter is responsible after a while of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, he was taken up by the Vice-President of Parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD, and even now the local newspaper is full of him.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"Neither did they change my toilet record," said the man mentioned in the introduction.
For the most part, according to the workers, seniors are coming to see if they get a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as the RPG promises in a special offer.
Half discount on February rent is also granted to other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
However, the Havířovská "deregulation" partition is definitely not overwhelmed.
"There were only about 40 to 50 people from 360 clients yesterday because of the 2011 rent," they estimate the worker behind the counter.
In doing so, the RPG proposes individual negotiation of contracts where necessary on the web and its bulletin boards.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not about threatening, but about information about only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG warns on its website.
"No one will be sued here," one of the RPG workers thinks, and the man on the street outside the client center is partly right.
"I have 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 left to eat, I haven't got enough to sue," he says.
The worker, however, will be disconcerted soon after.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
Rent regulation ends in most Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartment it is their increase of economic necessity.
"The existing rent still does not reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the newly pissed tenant of the housing fund is the main reason for raising rents.
While for five years between 2005 and 2010, the RPG could have invested four billion of the rents in the apartments, for four years from 2011 to 2014, it is to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats some red highlighted information.
"The increase of rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 flats, which is more than 90% of RPGs."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 flats from the RPG portfolio will increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19,66 per square metre," says RPG.
At 2,600 flats, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Apartments promises that deregulation will not drive rents out in leaps, but will be spread out within four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) will be put back into the apartments, mainly into thermal savings - new windows and heating.
They are to be given priority by people who sign an agreement to raise rents.
The offices include a kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would have expected that he was also hiding a mini-school with everything in it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys, and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of employees of Arch.Design can visit her.
The design-architectonic company Arch.Design, whose studios produced a number of important buildings in Brno, counted on the space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the building Avriopoint.
She employs almost 90 people, mostly in the age of babyboom, and she cared so that the women of the designer and architect can quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of shorter periods, the kindergarten benefit is offered by Arch.Design to its employees under the social programme.
The builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding jobs with child care.
The minischool was invented by the employees of Arch.Designu themselves and with the support of the management they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company minischool is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (a subsidy of CZK 2, 8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operation for two years.
After exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged for 3 years to operate a mini-school at its own expense.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the application for a subsidy was significantly assisted by Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the day-to-day care is provided by a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education, so children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over 3 years old.
Since it is a "minischool," only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more will be replaced during the day.
Kindergarten operations are flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the company hierarchy.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in a mini-school is comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation to school benches, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time, and stress situations with delayed picking up children from kindergartens away from parents' workplaces fall away.
Parents thus use working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there is naturally a loyal relationship between an employee and an employer.
Arch.Design has thus joined Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program boosted personnel marketing.
The house of the bones fascinates even after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are an open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the locals have earned the name House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all typical of the Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudí.
The facade of the house plays out dream lines, tender colors and textures resembling nature and animals.
In detailed observations, geometry, rhythm and a precise order can be seen.
At night, the whole facade of houses sounds even more dramatic; it is illuminated so that the impression of the color shine is enhanced.
The winding and twisting of shapes appears equally in interiors.
The wood in the waves is copied by window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peepholes and rails.
The House of Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was built by architect Emilio Sal Cortes in 1877.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on tearing down the old building and building a whole new one, soon accepted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló's Apartment House was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on his design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaic on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists worked on the facade.
The joint work on Casa Batlló's designs started with successful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Park Güell, in which there are other works of Gaudí.
From the locals soon to completion, he earned the name "Bone House" thanks to his organic shapes.
Others began calling him "shouting house " because of a specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia, is likened at the top of the building.
Other sculptural elements of the building also contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys for his time.
The bizarre may seem to be their forty-five-degree slope.
Gaudí had absolutely no respect for the construction regulations at the time and was not bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the details of the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later the city council was disfigured and asked for correction.
For example, the construction affected the fact that the building interfered with the pillar and the public sidewalk.
There has never been a correction, on the contrary: only 15 days after the call of the city district, Josep Batlló has applied (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by a jewelry store.
The whole six-story house intersects the stairwells, which can be climbed to the rooftop terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening a salon door and a larger company can communicate comfortably without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
Apart from the new facade, the house with Gaudi's reconstruction also received an unconventional roofing and two floors.
Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles is impressive, surrounded by inner courtyards and skylights.
The game of two colors gives the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs sunlight.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and lavish apartment made available to the public.
The owners decided not to take this step until 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They persisted in the tours as they found that it was a very advantageous business and additionally extended the tours with common and attic spaces, including roof terraces.
The entrance fee is definitely not negligible, it is EUR 16.50 and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you must quickly make friends with one of the residents of the apartment building and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattress and grid: women have different requirements than men
Not a fancy bed frame, but the quality of the lounge area, i.e. a mattress and a grate, give the basis really good beds.
However, they must complement themselves harmoniously in order to suit a particular user.
In selection, many things decide from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which mattresses and grates are made.
Typical example?
For example, there are no suitable latex mattresses for weekend cottages where they are not regularly heated because they are slower to "heat. "
Moreover, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
It is often necessary to turn them over regularly.
Because if they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid plate, they're holding moisture: mold might also appear under them.
The custom also decides when choosing.
Who has spent longer time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they wouldn't sleep here."
"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they mistake "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, but also other customers, were looking for lazy foam mattresses years ago.
"Today it's okay, a suitable mattress like Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL guy to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle " works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
There's no pressure, you won't turn around at night like you did after a tough fight.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
Lazy foam works as protection from bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Both male and female with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be 90 cm in the case of double beds, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for bed width is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands comfortably slightly crouched in your elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the Guildmaster of the Upholstery and Decorator Guild, who has devoted himself to the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures it in professional schools.
With the double bed, each needs its own grate and mattress, but here, be careful when buying to match the heights of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to fit the grates to different heights, but you may not succeed at each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters should be counted on the forming and raising layer.
"You must definitely not feel the springs when touching the hands or sitting on the mattress," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Upholstered beds, when mattresses and backgrounds are like conjoined Siamese twins, have no place in the bedrooms.
The mattress is badly ventilated, their covering cannot be washed, which is common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0,75 l per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
Therefore, experts reject advertising slogans about the lifetime of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its own buts.
Therefore, advice from dealers: for mattresses with a width of 120 cm or 140 cm hygiene and work removable coating don't give up, but rather add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are commonly made today with sliders all over the circuit, so after opening we get two parts (for washing and washing machine size very important!), however, handling in larger types (and in one person) during the shooting could remind us of a lightweight fight in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum bed for one night visits.
However, provide the plate (if it no longer has) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it. Taschenfederkern) and a pendulum layer.
A polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a base.
There will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut) on 14 to 18 lamellas, but it will always pay off the grate with more lamellas, 28 or more, where the lamellas in the lumbar area are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
The positioning lamel grates do not include a mattress with a spring frame because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to setting the rigidity of the slats you can also indulge the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the lamellas, which allows to push or even tilt the lamela so that the shoulder of the sleeper pretty "damaged."
For men who have "shoulders all over their backs," it's definitely important.
Even mattress manufacturers remember it, who started using the softening zone in the "man" area of the shoulders.
They also remember women - they give them softer surfaces in hips.
For the most demanding customers are wings or plate grates with so-called multi-torment springs.
The pressure decomposes into more points and reduces the voltage.
But beware, once you use the wrong pillow on the right mattress and grate (big and "big"), most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is to support the head and tops only to reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
50 x 60 cm is recommended as an appropriate size, which they prefer for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance (together with the shoulder cradle of the grate or softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original grass-filled straws.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least secondary components.
The trend is just organic on the mattress.
Oil raw materials from which polyurethane foam is produced are replaced by natural oils, such as a jump and soy.
Soy is used by all known producers.
"Bio at the mattress means that the core is made of purely natural material," explains Petr Vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also have microcapsules to relax the fresh smell of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man "cools" the herbal extract of the birch to absorb the mattress heat and cool the body, the women's covers "heat" on the other hand.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so the weaker sex is warmer.
Tonight's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with broken cell structure, it is more breathable than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of cold foam and lazy foam gives rise to multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, shoulders and heels should be.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and above.
Those fulfilling health parameters have a lower VAT rate, they are treated as medical aids.
He was the first to reach Gumotex in the Czech Republic for this advantage.
Saving the mattress and the grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can take advantage of the events of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreez mattress with sewn memory foam Memory into the cover for CZK 11,990.
The second one can be bought free of charge.
The era of lazy, or viscoelastic foam with open cell structure and high density started the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because at the start, astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
Tempur gets soft in the heat, hardens in the cold.
The warm human body thus perfectly adapts and decompresses its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the emergence of bedsores, but also to increase the comfort of sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special cushions under the feet, which lighten the legs and venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and so on.
People's surveillance devices want more and more parents, so they want to babysit their children.
Fearing for your own child brings more and more people to the idea of a GPS babysitter.
The system originally created for car search can also monitor people's movement, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox so far, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A lot of people got scared of the missing Anka case and started looking for means to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about another means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy happening," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a case such devices may be abused, for example, if they are put in a bag by someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met such a case yet."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," said Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box " serves and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if the child doesn't want to wear anything like this, he'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose some things when they don't want to be in control."
"Great expectations were called by the parents' cell phones, which can be turned off as well as these tracking devices," says Bočková.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such an establishment would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the kidnapping is concerned, the perpetrator practically always ensures that the child has no electronics that could reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will look for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of sudden assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, even if the attack results in the immediate destruction of the tracking device, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to periodically send the position after a certain period of time."
"If damage occurs, at least the last position of the person concerned shall be available.'
"Even if one slips and remains stationary, the device will immediately send a warning with position," says Bohemia.
According to him, smart cell phones with navigation can also carry a similar service, where special software can be uploaded.
The problem with current surveillance units is that they are either instruments similar to matchbox pendants or smaller mobile phones.
They're always at risk of losing them.
According to Pilino of Macro Weil, this is why the device that looks like a normal digital watch is now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that a possible aggressor does not have to recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he will recognize them after some time and it can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device evolves into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology that is used to babysit cars.
It is a combination of GPS location detection (which uses common autonavigation) and mobile phone functions that report the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would have wrapped the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of cords with which explosives are detonated.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometers of lines to the warehouses.
The army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifeline is two, four years tops.
The army bought incendiary cords from the stock STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff in the justification for buying such a huge amount of MF's incendiary cords today wrote off that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of matches per year in training.
However, it follows from the calculations of the military bomb squad that MF approached today that all generals, officers in command of the military, secretary or cleaning staff would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Minister of Defense of Alexander Vondra and commander of the army of Vlastimil Pick, not to mention.
It's the only way to justify an army's annual consumption of 60 kilometers of ignition.
That length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if it were true that the basic training of each new professional requires a maximum of two metres of incendiary cord, as experts say, the army provided fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of engineers or special units - of supplies for the aforementioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained personally to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition in handguns, so the shootings due to the need for money are also limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't bother me either, that they buy from us repeatedly such a large amount of matches."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what it's for."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we try to accommodate as traders," says STV Group business manager Jan Děcký.
The Ministry of Defence spokesperson Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometers of purchased cords and the army will have supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only talks about the four-year life of the ignition chamber and police or military bomb squad even only about two years.
"In perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who does not want to publish his name as a soldier because of the criticism of the army.
After the lifetime, each ammunition must be tested carefully to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers on life.
But these tests are not free, and they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a quantitative discount of 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"It cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," says Pejšek, Spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Buyers.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of the firing cords of police bombers, which eliminate ammunition from the Second World War or here after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police are always ordering enough to consume this ammo before the end of life.
It has proved its worth because of the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence has already had considerable difficulties with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the Czechoslovak army prepared for the campaign on the Rhine.
The Czech according to the bomb squad, which MF addressed today, awaits the same problem in a few years: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old matches that "lacino" buys today.
To this day, I'm getting from the contacts I got from the competition.
The winning place in the Trader of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise to his hotel.
The winner of last year's Trader of the Year competition was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec he lacked quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan he bought a half-built house with five flats.
For a third-year college student back then, that was a lot of courage.
"Then the ratio between quality and price of accommodation did not allow me to do anything about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment started renting to foreign workers.
He invested all his profits back in the house, which gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then he managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec.
The most comfortable one was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year another one of the same quality was added to it.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the franchise of the Pytloun hotels reporting," says last year's businessman number one.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel has largely contributed to the victory in the competition Trader of the Year," adds Pytloun.
Victory brought him more familiarity and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People used to get to know me on the streets, and they often congratulated me again and I have to say it was nice," he recalls.
He definitely recommends participation in the competition to all those who are trying to do something.
There is no need to win, every visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances he might not have gotten to.
"I started doing business with some of the people I met because of the competition."
Glory associated with success, according to him, fell a little on every employee.
And that he's in his 70s.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in their participation in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is pushed to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
But thanks to the aim of the winner, Farmet has had worse times.
Last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, came to the first prize in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the Slavic House.
The jury then appreciated the effort through which it built a company with hundreds of millions turnovers from a small tool shop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and increased our confidence to fight competition," says last year's winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
So, when the state offered Karel Žďárský's father a small workshop to rent out as compensation for the communists seized property, he long did not hesitate, refused his career at the firm where he was working, and with a few friends around his father founded a company on plastic baths.
Soon later, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Even among the non-professional public, the company gained greater awareness after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers begin to see the brand Farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with a company that had achieved greater success in its country," says Karel Žďárský.
But in the past year, Farmet was not merely a sign of euphoria from the winners.
The valuation was based on the company's economic results until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the hardest year to sell engineering goods.
There was a crisis that hasn't touched the citizens so much yet, but companies have stopped their investment projects and started to limit the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, has not eluded us."
"We had to cut production and we had to cut our losses," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable firm has to be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But the situation was managed and kept the company profitable, though smaller than before the crisis.
But what they did not discount at Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre from subsidies, we have strengthened the presentation at international trade fairs, we have won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything suggests that the crisis is over.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
An Survey That Eliminates Nonsensical Regulations
The survey on Absurdity of the Year is a fourth part of the business competition.
Some nonsense regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year's survey Absurdity of the Year became the duty to carry documents that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than four thousand voting decided on it.
For example, social security management required a paper statement from the Commercial Register, even if an official can get it by two clicks of mouse.
The poll's gonna change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register for checks on insurance payers," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
Shine on all regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and the senseless ones to cancel is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth part of the business competition organized by the Economic Newspapers this year, and it is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If there were about 3,000 voters in the vote last year, this year nearly 4,000 vote.
And no wonder, the various legal obligations that serve only to delay business, there is still enough and enough.
"We are at the top of the world in the number of tax returns," Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic notes.
The simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving particularly compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has ranked 74th in terms of terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can apply administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September when the competition is closed.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used to sign in.Then the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for "anticen" and will have the public vote on it via the internet during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, 105 regulations and no sense regulations have been entered into this year's survey.
Tips were sent by businessmen, but also by professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the "finalists" of the competition, there was a requirement among the nominees that cars for maintenance of motorways and express roads pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's 7 designs is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of hapening, which regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted by this culmination of the competition.
"Commercial prosperity cannot work where the state is throwing businessmen under the bus, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which make business more difficult today," said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break nonsensical regulations doesn't sound empty.
In 2007 people were most annoyed by the entrepreneur's obligation to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the trade law.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office for its foreign employee a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the law on the so-called green card.
And third time's the charm.
It was absurd in 2009 to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two weight-bearing instruments in the office of the physiotherapists.
This was moderated this year by the decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator has passed away.
New category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects shall be evaluated.
This year's fifth annual competition of Hospodářské noviny is a category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote sensible and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the rebel competition of the year.
This year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafone Company of 2010 has registered companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspirational and would be published on a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities is diametrically different from one another, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and other people, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 nationwide finalists, for example, was the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company from the Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the foundation fund sponsoring handicapped children for 17 years.
The Poděbrad paper mill, which has more than 70 percent of them, is taking care of its disabled employees, thus obtaining the title Responsible company of the Central Bohemia Region and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition as the third.
In Olomouck, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, also reduced to an average of 35 hours a week but without a reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for the priority of shopping from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the surrounding area and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration will have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region thinks about the health of its employees and has provided ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of Prani and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of premium bonuses.
"In our country we again give contributions to food, transport, increasing qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year were automatically logged into the category Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the competitors did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition but were not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to register for this competition alone because it is a sub-category of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Police arrested at the Land Fund in Pilsen during the competition
In the Pilsen Land Fund building in the past days, anti-corruption police have been arrested.
Cuffed detectives put on a local businessman in the media sphere and a real estate trader Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a particular interested party.
Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"For now, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for misdemeanors in a public contract and in a public tender," said Právu, head of the Pilsen State Attorney Antonia Zelená, stating that no further details can be provided with regard to the ongoing investigation.
Forty-six-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
In view of the minimal amount of official information, there is only speculation on how the competition could have affected it.
Speaker of the Lubomíra Černá Land Fund on request The law stated that police officers were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen during the competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she explained.
According to Černá, the public competition has the right name "Call for submission of land transfer rights under the Land Act" and takes place when more than one eligible applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons in the context of the call offer a higher value of their restitution rights to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the rights offered, the order of the acquirers shall be determined and the Land Fund shall then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," explained the Fund's spokesman.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who applied for the challenge, and because he himself is also an authorised person, because he purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered the interested parties that he would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he's cashing in his severance payments for that.
That would explain how he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had superior contacts with PF in Pilsen in the past.
He has worked in the case of former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing a replacement restitution of land for which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. received land from the fund, for example, intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the entrance magistral was to be built into the industrial zone of the Borská pole.
Later, he exchanged them very favorably with the Magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
That's when the town hall had to go for it, because otherwise, by blocking the property, it would put the building at risk.
Hundreds per month are paid to housing households
Households will have to pay extra for all energy from January onwards, but also for water and sewerage, heat supplies and rents will grow somewhere.
Since January, families will have to pull up to hundreds of crowns a month more than they do now.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay extra for the water supply and will often cost you the central heat supply.
The increase in electricity should cost households a hundred crowns a year more than they do now.
At the same time, the prices of power electricity have been reduced by all major suppliers, so there is a significant increase in support of renewable energy production, especially photovoltaics.
The gas will make it slightly more expensive, but at a time when people are drowning the most and have the highest consumption.
Therefore, they must also count on hundreds of extra crowns each year.
While electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Republic, the change in central heating prices varies from one place to another.
Price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about CZK 50 extra per month for central heating from January onwards, more than CZK 1000 a year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are at risk of being more than 9 percent more expensive to them by water and sewerage, if the city increases the rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, he's gonna pay a 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower prices in the whole republic.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it is expected to auction by 7.4 percent of the water and sewer.
For example, rent prices may rise significantly in 450 thousand apartments, where regulation has ended since January.
For example, CPI Apartments, which own about 2500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to 100% from January onwards.
Those who do not agree with the new rent amount intend to put the company in court.
Controlled rents paid by people in approximately 300,000 flats could increase by up to 10% next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which drinking ends most often in the care of doctors drunkard, who was not even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are repeatedly treated from a monkey in a hospital.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the income of the children's hospital department.
"Some beer or wine is completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Trendem is definitely a hard alcohol," said Luděk Pelikán, Director of Children's Department of Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"If they can pull a bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's whiskey, but otherwise it's fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into their juice and it doesn't make them feel so much," explained the chief.
And for the truth, he's also a spokesperson for the Motol Eva Jurin University Hospital.
"It's mostly fernet or rum at all."
"That's modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases it was a slivovitz that they brought from home," Jurinová said.
According to Chief Pelican, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers on hospital income are quite common.
In front of Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for ten years in Pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances bring broken schoolchildren from the surrounding area.
"One girl lay with us about four times."
"At the age of 12, she began her career when she was brought to us with a 3.5-millimeter of extra blood alcohol in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the Holešovice Exhibition Centre at some dance party."
"What's interesting is that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief of staff wondered.
It is the parents' disinterest or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring that is considered the main cause of growing childhood drinking.
According to experts in children, however, it is not possible to talk about dependence in the true sense of the word.
"The term alcoholic means several years of chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that is not the case with children."
"Those who repeatedly use alcohol are more likely to be characterised by a failed family-social background," explained Mayor Pelikán.
According to Jurinova, this year, 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the children's clinic in Motol until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxications that had to remain in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children's drunks who, after outpatient treatment, take their parents home or transport them home to the police, do not count.
Except when children sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, according to Pelican, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied upon: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either drink grief from bad report cards or celebrate the beginning of vacations."
"Of course, I experienced seven children's drunks at the reception of the witches at the same time," Pelikán said.
Ironically, a drunk who spends a night of detox under the supervision of doctors is at the advantage of having an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will drive away the irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients missing from the body.
"They're actually better off 'cause they have a nice evening experience and a good awakening and nothing hurts."
"They are only confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, saying that they sometimes spoil the pleasant mood of the patients with at least a list of the costs that their treatment required.
Transport of ambulance and hospitalization on an emergency bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a means of education, when I calculated directly on rounds to those children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on a part-time job to make money for that one party," Pelikán added.
However, health insurance companies, according to him, do not approach regression procedures in which parents would recover treatment costs in cases of child drunkenness.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two aircraft L-159 out of a total of five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M, took off on Tuesday to Sevilla, Spain, where the Casa - EADS aircraft manufacturer is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they've only been on exercise or demonstration flights abroad.
It is a two-digit version of L-159T1, which was still operated by the Czech army and which were flightable.
The remaining three machines are one-digit L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody and the broker of the trade - Omnipol company - took them over last week.
When aircraft physically transport from Vodochod, according to Jan Pejšek from the Press Department of Defence is not yet known.
"The single-seat L-159 aeroplanes for the exchange have been separated from long-term stored aeroplanes, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry of Finance'.
"The two-digit L-159T1s were replaced in current state and form," said Právu Pejšek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater aircraft, because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth CZK 200 million to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other by the end of this year.
According to Píšek, the EADS committed to deploying aircraft into the armament of some alliance country.
"The contract clearly states that the buyer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and will be used for training pilots from NATO countries."
"Therefore, it is a matter for the customer how this thing will be implemented," said Pejšek.
Hospodarske noviny said some time ago that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not write a tender for the purchase and addressed the EADS directly.
The defense management then argued that they would support the future exports of L-159 abroad in exchange.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero and only uses 24, the rest would like to sell.
Buying Casa's planes is likely to have a court-martial.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it was to select aircraft on the basis of a European tender and not by addressing one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at the Prague airport Kbely within 14 days.
Longer index finger than ring finger indicates lower risk of cancer
Men who have a index finger longer than a ring finger are less at risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published by the British Cancer Magazine on Wednesday.
It could be related to male testosterone hormone levels.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under the age of 60," said Ros Eeles, Professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other factors such as family health burden, supplied by Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, more than 1500 prostate cancer patients were followed by over 3,000 healthy men with colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger on their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
However, in the case of those with a index finger longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, with a decrease of even 87 percent for men to 60.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - appears to reflect the different levels of sex hormones exposed to the child in the uterus.
Less testosterone is consistent with a longer index finger.
Early research has shown that testosterone supports growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told the Czech News Agency that he knew about this study very quickly, but it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "completely proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and pavements lies mostly driven snow, roadmen in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89th and 93th kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and stands also D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
The central motor club dispatcher (ÚAMK) told the news.
A truck crashed at the 91st kilometer, two trucks collided at the 93nd kilometer, an accident called for an injury.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway on the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno at 190 kilometers or drive across Brno and then drive to 182 kilometers on the Boulevard.
It's a multi-mile column.
Also on the D11 motorway there is an accident, and it is immediately upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a multicentimeter layer of snow, thermometers show a minus seven degrees Celsius.
Cars are created on Prosek, for example, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Karlovy Vary Square and Náměstí Míru.
At 8:00 a.m., the Prague Crisis Staff will be back in session.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways had already had to cancel seven express connections due to the snow.
For example, the track from Prague to Kralup or Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
The Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already mobile, but only with caution.
In Vyškovsk there are three side roads, in Brno there are snow languages and in Blanens there are necessary to overcome some roads in the snow chains above.
The most affected places were Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
The cutters will need to be installed until they are extended.
When they are cleared, it is not yet possible to estimate.
Caution should be exercised in the White Carpathians area in Hodonín.
On roads that are kept there only inert sprinkles for conservation purposes, up to a five - inch layer of snow, the Czech News Agency told the Czech News Agency.
In the Czech Republic it attacked from two to ten centimeters of snow, the most fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, it attacked about 15 centimeters of snow.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually stops.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan known only as XM-25.
The generals are hoping that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and "change the game" to their advantage.
A new weapon is like a little super-precision cannon.
Its projectiles guide the laser with precision to several meters.
Special 25 mm rounds, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, actually act as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
Thus, they can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
Because it is not usually protected from the top, and when the murderous rain of steel shrapnel falls upon it, it can eliminate it from the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of XM-25, the new gun is the first gun for infantry using "smart" technology.
"The soldier treats it in principle by finding the target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, thus obtaining a specified purpose point, adjusting the dimensions according to it, and pressing the trigger."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun will charge and detonate the missile at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the current administrative building to the Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field, specializing in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday next July, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the current administrative building to the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to Fujist's spokesman, there should be another 100 jobs in the group, which are so far divided in the region, moving there in the near future.
The offer of rent was said to be very attractive and the large space offices in Astro Park are more suited to the working method of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only on rent.
Competent Executive Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with an excellent infrastructure"
An excellent connection with the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important enterprise within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment of the losers yesterday.
Head of Economic Officers in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that he was thus able to get a "global player."
It's said to be a "fantastic sign of trust in this location."
Fujitsu is supposed to fit the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwis, regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was said to have been informed in time by the management of the company of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," said Korwis.
Friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of computer manufacturers with landlord properties to Marienbader-square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
It is now about preventing long vacancy at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus Square, which so far used Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Verticale" were among the most discussed construction projects of the spa town ten years ago along with other buildings on Marienbader Square.
Between the railway station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entrance, which was criticized both because of the massive construction of areas that had previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, a company of investment advice and rating Feri, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as a manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, which was still connected to Siemens, moved into the home.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after a year were sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-koncern of Tokyo is referred to as the world's third largest IT provider.
It offers computers and servers for example and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the most employees of Fujitsu is in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions' subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
The administrative building Astro Park rented 7000 sqm for this purpose.
In the complex - its name draws attention to the stellar ground plan, which is twenty years old, is located among others also the central association of electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
The Amazon Internet Service has shut down the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is said to be staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol's wanted list, is to abstain from a newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the activists announced by Twitter's short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, Amazon had downloaded the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic messages to manage a high number of access to documents.
With Twitter, Wikileaks explained this step: "Fine - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe. "
When Amazon has such problems with free speech, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after the co-workers of Senator Joe Lieberman had done a search, announced CNN on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
Chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with boycott, informed the British "Guardian."
"I used to wish Amazon had taken this step earlier, given the earlier disclosures of classified information on Wikileaks," said the Senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called on to prevent the platform from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, outrageously and ruthlessly, and thus puts our national security at risk and threatens life on the entire planet" said one statement by a non-party senator.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks expand stolen material in their efforts."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list of wanted by Interpol.
Based on a report in London's newspaper "The Independent," 39 - year - old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard claims to know the exact location.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"Even there were calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, one of the senior government advisor Stephen Harper said on TV - ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target plane."
Meanwhile, there was a word shootout between the White House and Assange.
A spokesman for US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had requested the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently published spying challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The US government is now examining the security of its databanes extensively.
Deputy Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed as Special Officer.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "necessary structural reforms" that are necessary after publishing reports from the Embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger for publication on Wikileaks.
"We've made every effort to get in touch with them," said Secretary of State Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if necessary."
University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream candy makers are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice creammakers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors arrive from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream coming from anyway?
From Gelatiere and Gelatio.
Gelatiere, Czech a bit outdated ice-cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-cream art.
Gelataio removes ice cream from the cooler, wipes it into a waffle and sells it.
To find this out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
Anyone who wants to know more about ice cream can't avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream machine manufacturer set up an ice cream university to match the ice cream from his machines to high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is a huge interest and visitors arrive from all over the world.
However, it also offers several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in its own ice cream shop.
Some people in their Midlife-Crisis want a new career, others dare on the thin ice of their unclear desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant, and she wants to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian housewife Julia arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste but also silky softness and good consistency are crucial.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the Southern and Patriotic cherry on the cake: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it includes a very good dose of romance. "
The first step in production seems quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything up with an electronic program at 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then turn the tap on the machine and spill pasteurized white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the lecturer is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without stabilizer?
How can a man experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of the time into the unknown.
Those who speak of ice cream "only natural ingredients" seem to have used stabilisers - mostly natural products such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it collides and the customer eats ice beans.
Certain variations of basic matter are allowed.
It'll be more exciting with aromatic essence.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"You should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with an ice cream made of white basic matter that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of all kinds of chocolate temptations.
He may now attend the course for ice cream machines.
Luciano always makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice creams - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavourings or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will also be performed with fruity ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnut.
The most popular ice cream from the kiwi is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
It is only when the balanced mixture rightly picks up the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content of the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream needs extra sugar.
Luciano removes a device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (wines measure grape must).
Fortunately, the tables ease the numbers.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only a device for automatic production of basic matter.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools it to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo dirty himself and also his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when he gets out of control by a huge blender.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in double light
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered to be an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," said the head of Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The leader of the team of experts Efsa for genetically changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and another expert Efsa have had a contract with the association of lobbyists Ilsi for several years.
It is financed by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated decisively in the control regulations of Efsa for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
Efsa's rules are said to be consistent in whole paragraphs with Ilsi's documents and thus carry the handwriting of the industry, which should be controlled by the Authority in Parma, Italy.
It's the second time the Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, the high manager from Efsa has passed without additions or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural Syngenta Group - and has thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the EU-Office for Control with the Industrial lobby, which has aroused interest both in the Ministry of Environment and in Members of the EU.
Meanwhile, Efsa can't identify a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those of industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have contact with industry.
But he has to prove them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that genetically altered plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that genetic plant reactions to environmental effects are not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, a genetically altered corn in the field will do," says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which will not prove reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, then how could they be found?", he asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
A scientist has been researching the genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University in Zurich.
In this area, industry, like in the US, is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists that are not linked to the groups anymore.
Studies that are critical to society are mostly not published.
"Industrials control security research," Hilbeck believes.
Footprint of Stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night he stood outside the station in Stuttgart, a tuba on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the diggers arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the railway station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings lay in ruins.
Broken to 6000, 7000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43.
He's secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"She can't disappear."
It melts: "Full and poor stone, simple and original. "
When one of them cut open, it smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former deponic of the French army where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man deals with old rocks.
He bought everyone that was created during the crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they got crushed into gravel or disappeared into deponics," he says in his office, a wooden booth that used to be a guard house.
He says that he was being cursed and threatened when in September all the newspapers said that he had bought the leftovers of the northern wing from a company that was doing demolition.
But he's been talking to S-21's opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he wasn't responsible for the demolition at all.
And now that it's happening, it's the smartest thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then they took about 200 S-21-antibodies each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, a price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it during re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from every corner and dragged what fit into the trunk and the trailer.
Stones of dispute from Stuttgart have long been transformed into "wages" or as the edges of herb beds.
"This stone is actually nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it wasn't for the political insertion."
He gets into his off-road car and goes for a ride in his 20-haul kingdom.
He studied law first, he interrupted the study, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a rock lover.
He's got 40,000 tons of rocks.
He collects his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest stone dealer in the country.
It's braking.
In the snow lies an artistically worked sandstone.
"They once belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is thrilled.
"My favorite rock."
We're on our way up through the woods.
It points to the pile: red sandstone, earlier part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
One day, those blocks belonged to the Neckarstadion bleachers in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police prezidia in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be broken by hand and transported using simple pulleys and bull carriages, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to be crushed."
He didn't become rich, he didn't become very rich at all.
But today the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition the stonemakers, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glasssmith, and one gardener were settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the leftovers.
He has to go to Cologne anytime soon.
That's where the rocks will be saved.
Fighting talent on High-Potentials
There's a lot of people at the snack shop.
16 students are pushing for bread with salmon, tomato soup and candy.
Technical University in Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and by the way to meet Volkswagen.
Many companies try to compete for the smartest heads in the race, as well as VW, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditoriums, even before they reach the labour market and are interested in others.
Since universities don't issue any lists of success stories for their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig is trying to win the car group talent the next day.
A young lady in the personal department handing out pens, rubber teddy bears and VW logos.
He tells promising young talents about practice programs, student jobs, and suggests to them the way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see advantages for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience. "
"VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who might be useful as a coworker."
Such cooperation, according to Sella, is not unusual.
But the news is, he's so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, he was more of a major professional project," says Selle.
I think the struggle for fresh graduates is gonna be even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long ranks of candidates.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract particularly highly skilled workers.
First of all, graduates of engineering have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German Engineers VDI remained vacant 40,000 engineering positions in October.
And according to VDI predictions, the lack of engineers will increase.
Roman Dykta goes to the auditing and consulting firm KPMG for talent hunting.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure race, in which participants must find their way according to the GPS coordinate.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also take a look at the KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
It will decide in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested parties will fly to the USA.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities, Dykta's laws will be getting tougher and harder.
"We want to be different from the others with our Race."
"The simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like the talent hunter Dykta's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in the similar event last year."
"Some will soon finish their studies and plan to apply for a job" he says.
In addition to direct approach to the campus, small and medium-sized companies present themselves in classic labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"As for example on Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of HR of Solar World manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonn company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions written on the company's website.
"At present, it is difficult to fill the seats."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible for us to do a practice or write a thesis."
A solar specialist doesn't have any expensive promotions.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Big corporations often can't offer it," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
Money has not played a major role in the search for work for a long time.
Flexible working hours, babysitting or good practice options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld occupied 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany in one Great Place to Work study.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, colleagues are asked how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and monitor the employee's framework conditions.
The head of the personal department of Stübe hopes that the placement will bring her points for job seekers.
"I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about external evaluations of potential employers," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer leads through its own employees," he says.
Professionally, it is called the internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of the employer in the market within his own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game," says Kriegler.
Obama is stopping new oil wells
Over the following years, new oil wells will not emerge outside the US-Clave state of Florida's coast in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued an appropriate ban - thus definitively abolishing the earlier plans.
Also outside the Atlantic coast, new wells are still forbidden.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar reported it on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling tower in April.
President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drillings in the eastern Gulf of Mexico before this disaster, which cost 11 employees their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the US.
This is what the advocates are trying to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The center of criticism is the British energetic BP group, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The investigation committee commissioned by Obama should submit the results during December.
In October, the Interior Minister Ken Salazar abolished the drilling ban that had been in force since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil groups submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster through stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the Authority is fundamentally reforming itself, which has drawn attention to itself by many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will substantially reduce the amount of oil extracted in the Gulf.
"The government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of gas and oil industries" is the result of the current survey in the field by consulting company BDO - before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
In addition, the American Energy Alliance complains of uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what will change by regulation. "
Investment in new mining projects is being shifted until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of oil leaked destroyed nature in the Ogoni area of Nigeria.
People do stealing, corruption, and illegal oil cooking for a living.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," calms the journalists' environmental activist: "Today you'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian was watching an attempt to photograph a boy wading across his breast with water that surrounds the smudges: the scene appears almost nicely in water gloss with rainbow colors.
The fact that brown oil clots are floating beneath the surface is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough shrimp into the vessels, told Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a vast watery area from the broken leadership.
Fishers from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area located in the heart of the Niger Delta is one of the worst infested areas in the world.
On the way down the river, mangrove swamps with lots of side tributaries are still noticeable the entire range of triggers.
The boat's engine boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand into the water pulls out his oil fingers.
Mangrove roots rise from the ground like black bars of licorice, seldom occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain, we look for flocks of birds that are commonly found in wet areas: As soon as the boat's engine dies down, it gets rattled in an earlier paradise where it smells like a pump, scary silence.
"What is happening here is the ecological leadership of war" says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
A comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe came here, here in the 1980s the first resistance was formed with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here Shell had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the three-size Swiss delta is being mined daily with more than 5,000 drilling wells and more than 2 million barrels of black gold, there are oil fields in the Ogoni area, and the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred metres, the steel structure rises from the water like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas Trees," so too tenderly called borehole heads.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusted to the bone.
At any moment, the head of the drilling hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then flows a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres of oil flowed into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil flowed into the sea near Alaska in the crash of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in mankind's history.
There are disputes about who is responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While Shell calls the sabotage and organized theft of oil more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists refer to the crackling heads of wells and leaks as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than is the custom in the world, the group was accused in 2008 by US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only a number of faults in leadership are said to be "a number of times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-stained workshop under the open air, the figures emerge from the mangrove trees: they are completely naked and up to the neck from oil.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by the management, partially scattered across the ground, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
Oil heats up in a barrel of fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First it flows from the line into the crate of gasoline, later it drips at the end of the kerosine line and finally oil.
In this way, Michael and his four associates produce up to four barrels a day of 300 liters: "We'll make about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents are using chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria only owns one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of 40 cents of euro per litre of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from the "bunkers" that connect to the lead everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost in the Niger delta area each day.
But only a negligible small part of the temporary stored raw material will be illegally refined: The largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate on whether the people and their interventions or the lax way of production have caused a disaster is considered purely academic by activist Akpobari.
"If oil companies weren't considered invaders and hadn't destroyed the life of fishermen so perfectly, there wouldn't be sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the exit of the group is considered: "Maybe other nations will prove to be better than the Chinese. "
Michael's gonna be upset.
"Time to disappear," says the muscular manufacturer.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If they were found by a special military unit, they wouldn't be in danger of prison, but a painful bribe.
Soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - also want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has gotten our country to the bottom in all respects," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major safety defect.
Investigators found a possible building error during a search for an emergency landing machine that could lead to a "disaster engine failure."
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers were probably more lucky in an emergency landing at the beginning of November than was known so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority identified a major safety malfunction in some A380 engines in its investigations - and now warns about a possible building mistake.
Perhaps a glitch would have severe consequences: cracks could arise on one oil connection due to weariness, this Thursday in the published statement by ATSB.
This could lead to a "disaster engine failure."
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It has given reasons for the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
The head of Qantas Alan Joyce said that his company would be seeking compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and damaged the supporting surfaces.
Rolls-Royce called the cause of the damage to the burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aeroplanes equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said spokesperson ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its fleet A380 on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa switched the A380 engine as a safety precaution.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
The nationwide snow will cause traffic chaos
Germany in white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and airplanes are jammed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the whole Republic fell into the night at freezing snow temperatures at Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still engaged, but could not handle new snow.
In addition, there was a strong shock wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Office (BSH) awaits a stormy storm on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning with a water level of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow wills have caused considerable problems in Saxony on motorways and national roads.
According to Meteomedia's bad weather headquarters, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland, the level of alarm was purple - the highest level at all.
Part of it attacked 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds causing twigs.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Police authorities also reported major road troubles in Saxony-Anhalt.
On A2 caused the wind and snow slow traffic and congestion.
In Durynsk there were difficulties due to snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Railway, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Durynsk and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, inverted trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
Long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
In Duryn Saalfeld had to stop an ICE in Munich.
165 passengers received wool blankets, food and drink on the train from firemen and paramedics.
The snow wind blew across the road.
Many flights were cancelled at large German airports due to snow winds.
According to the spokesperson of the headquarters for flight information, nullified flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to the spokesman of Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
There are few passengers left at the airport without connection, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
Due to the snow road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: there was also a truck caught on the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning hours.
And a 30 - year - old woman died after turning her car into a slippery road at Aschaffenburg.
Yet, meteorologists have good news: snow will remain in the form of light powder, so even with light winds it will rise.
But the wind will fade.
Only by the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds of wind power.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its mark: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at Frankfurt's headquarters.
Real estate could yield up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; meanwhile, bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
But now he probably wants the financial group's renovation costs back - and he's looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, as he reports "Financial Times Deutschland" referring to the speaker.
The speaker didn't name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still exploring whether it is more meaningful to own or sell and then to rent again" he said.
This gives up the largest credit institution in Germany again after a short period of time.
The bank only took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them expensively.
According to the figures, the energy reconstruction swallowed about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, experts estimate the value of meanwhile renamed towers to "Greenowers" at around 500 million euros.
The speaker said that it is not decided whether the building will be sold again to the assets of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands grieve for dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
The dead have not yet been rescued because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
There was a probe running into the shaft where the disaster occurred, but there was no sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend due to safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came from the fact that the miners no longer had a chance to survive.
Still unable to free the dead.
Now they have honored the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, the southern island of New Zealand, 10,000 people gathered in sunny weather.
They kept quiet for two minutes.
29 tables, helmets, flashlights, and names of miners were built to honor the memory of buried miners.
Also pictures and personal things like clothes and surfboards here have found their place.
There were flags halfway through the government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would again come out of the "deep land" to the surface, said to the participants of the memorial event Prime Minister New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial event.
During the explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also overwhelmed.
Paramedics started by putting out fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poisonous gases dissolve, the cooling of high temperatures inside the mine begins, police President Gary Knowles told the journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Is a horror movie suitable for an art theater?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to retake the old border with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience was Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn thinking of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his torturers and kills with the supernatural power of his opponents in large numbers - it sounds ideal for young men's viewers who seek bloody action because our hero helps with cruel methods of killing and even rips the guts of his enemies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eyed, as it is actually called, will not say a word during the whole film, and the other characters will perform at most one or two sentences or be torn down to the painful dying screams.
Otherwise, they remain silent and rejoice in the terrifyingly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the scenery to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera footage.
It's a good thing when a movie has more target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy on drug dealers "Pusher," is considered to be the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists bringing his works closer either to the mainstream humor or to a less brutal artistic audience.
Most fans of the art theater are likely to be discouraged by their brains and entrails splashing everywhere.
The fans of action films will be bored at the latest at the moment when the One-Eye sets off for free explaining reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will hang forever in the wind and mist before the team apparently sails to America and continues to remain silent there.
So it is no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not enter the cinemas in Germany and was now released only on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive façade, somewhere up to the broken blood, he hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it's not a dialogue or an exact story, it's all an atmosphere, a feverish dream that's become a film.
And there's no escape for the viewer.
Refn doesn't give him a moment of relaxation and slowly chokes him with his frosty shots and a grim hypnotic soundtrack, but above all an indescribable hatred that swells from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One Eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all the most one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and temporary allies of a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It creates destruction, but maybe only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has a new alert for a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and it will not allow control.
Around midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007 at least four Israeli combat aircraft F-15 I will attack the mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dairy as-Saur.
Its name appears in the International Nuclear Energy Office (IAEA) documents when it is a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
On the basis of a US-American foreign secret service communication from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would fit well for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Fifty-year tech doesn't fit anything else.
The CIA presented a video of unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, it explained where the reactor components could have been before the destruction, to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of Yongbyon Nuclear Center.
In addition, photographs were submitted showing the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been launched shortly before, but without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years of bombing, there's no more than that, even the riddles have grown even more.
Former US-President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but basically didn't have the evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some intelligence rapporteurs in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of the "alleged reactor," even though they consider the presentation of the CIA to be "true."
They lack clear evidence, just like IAEA.
When asked how sure he is about the reactor, he answered a high UN diplomat in the summer, says the IAEA has enough material to ask questions.
The rubble allegedly "unused military buildings" was quickly removed by the Syrians and also properly leveled the terrain.
Yet, in June 2008, the IAEA team was found under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in the el-Kibar uranium traces, which was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photos of commercial vendors just after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, this footage is not on the market because it was exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, expressed Damascus.
But that was disproved by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss matters - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, he forbade the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of a bombed building.
But Israel is also firmly silent.
"We will never comment," confirmed the official position recently at that time by the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has therefore been without success since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Authority', as the high Western diplomat admitted at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - it is a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty, which IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers another three devices to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet stated which facilities they are, or what function they are, or why they are suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite images, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It appears to be located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason, Syria rejects the IAEA's approach to these three locations.
In Vienna, it was said that Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that IAEA would have been sent to the US in advance to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to a US secret service facility.
The IAEA has the background and also satellite images that the material was transported here and there between these three places and the square at the Euphrates.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one arranged should be "in connection with fuel production."
However, there is no "any evidence of sensitising activities', i.e. enrichment of uranium and new processing; the processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium should be cut off from it later on into a bomb, there are only likely estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether the debris that could hide important traces are stored in these three places.
It's as if hundreds of cargo trucks have vanished from the face of the earth, no one seems to have any information on where the rubble has come from.
Only a few kilometers away from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates lying salt mine al-Tibni, which had Syria inspected in 1998 as an appropriate warehouse for radioactive waste, considers IAEA unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley associated him with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the images from space show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out all the suspicious places of earthwork and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months building a plan for reviewers that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the auditors' interest is.
In the meantime, Damascus rejected this proposal as well.
If western diplomats in Vienna had calmed down a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why the thing is not on fire, US ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already spoken of the "opportunity to which I lean in the future," yet hesitates.
This choice presents a great risk: On the one hand, there is a need for a majority on the IAEA Governing Council and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What happens if they don't find anything in the end? "
Love in Wartime
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on a nameless primary in the summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote a script herself, it's a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but it also causes restlessness.
There is persistent talk of a woman who is a Muslim falling in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the Yugoslavian war.
The Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
Meanwhile, the film was finished in Hungary and it is in post-production, but Bosensko is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through UN-organization to help the refugees of the UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with an actress, informed the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also an ambassador to the UN-organization to help refugees.
Not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the camps where they were raped, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN-organization to help refugees release Jolie as ambassador, informs the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given the opportunity to read her script, allowed the filming in Sarajevo after a small turn - it is not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author stresses that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has worked hard to address the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of war and give space to all parties involved.
Because of the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the movie on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war began and meet again when she is a Bosnian Muslim, dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds different than "the rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's movie really starts before the war is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her that "is not fair and is based on incorrect information."
Now she can be freed by Hollywood hekers: By illegally posting her script online, as they have done many times.
♪ Nothing but gone ♪
It's good for the Irish again this evening.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates the power of its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream with joy behind the sound of loud music, stomping their feet.
Bailey-Pub in the South American Cork boils because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and they hit.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus and also tickets to Las Vegas at the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this yelled beer game and a restrained informatic, it doesn't really match.
Yet, a 26 - year - old man tries to have fun, to relax from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan isn't playing passion in Las Vegas, he's going to interview New Zealand in January.
"I have a weird feeling about this," he says.
"It's so far away and I haven't got a job yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiling.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already tried their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now has a place as an IT advisor in London.
The boys are leaving: As with Tanners, it looks in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the foreseeable future, forecasting experts from the ESI Scientific Institute for Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They even count to 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar emigration wave to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After decades of rise, which has brought great prosperity to the Irish, insolence is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly upsetting to young, educated Irish people who have only seen the rise so far.
The loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was wasted.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "Everything is going downhill in Ireland. "
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - who can, who goes away and our country loses a generation."
"Please let the last light go out."
Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government is only deceiving and does not offer young people any prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-old.
Watching her classmates hang out from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo," an exhibition that offers a total service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ranking," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed together with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen right now.
In January he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to pay off a home loan.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, when for the first time in a long time it crosses the threshold of its own house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I'm basically not at all."
He laughs embarrassingly and walks through cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, large expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for EUR 380,000 - 100-percently financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money was without many questions," he says.
Is he worried it might not turn out well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, he pours out the hot tea and says: "I have no children to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again. "
A construction engineer doesn't like the whining he hears so often.
"Nobody has to starve - our situation isn't as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it will only make us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back again and life passed on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keeping the future open and simply waiting for life to develop elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that he is very concerned about these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's worried she might go to a bachelor party.
"First of all, no emotions," he says, and drinks a lot of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it the exit party, plain and simple, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
Criminal activity raises more concern than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of the Latin-barometro, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the whole area.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America is in quite a happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% per year since 2002, the promotion of democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populous areas, are the democratic beliefs, which are tightening the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (graph 3).
Some 34% said they trusted the House in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Support was probably created during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
But the mood is changing in a wide range from ground to ground (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and its outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's popularity are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
Only the second time more respondents across Latin America have seen crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Some 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives were victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% of last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private business and market economy: around 71% of respondents across the area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage has increased from 56% of 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has increased from 47% from last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same view (and 80% support private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area, as 19% of respondents mentioned (as compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, no change compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized Options
No one expected the general elections in Haiti to be perfect on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections meant filling urns and repeating votes, ballots scattered over channels, broken polling rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved because of the January earthquake, roamed around trying to find out where they could vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several anticipated pre-runners, shouted that this was a fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways it was a pretty good election. "
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community cautiously said that "they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they were, did not necessarily have to cancel the process. "
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body whose opposition votes are owed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is to announce its preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martella, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former First Lady, have withdrawn from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
However, there may be a problem if Mr Célestin, who has little or little support among voters, is identified as having achieved a decisive duel.
Because of the rampant cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were concerns that electoral participation would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization they were prevented.
Roughly 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained undivided shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians will take their own initiative.
Tip-toe downtown
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, benefited from public sympathy when her popularity strengthened from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in the elections next year may depend on Mrs Fernández giving up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And on these signs everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend more revenue as they please.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized in the death of Mr Kirchner for a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (at which the government was slapped and blamed for corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply next year, with the President spending more space as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: this year's growth is likely to be up to 9%.
Official inflation rates are now 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions speak of a figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined office in 2003, when Argentina suffered economic collapse, set priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared the INDEC, a statistical agency that proceeded to monitor official inflationary statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private businesses and trade union leaders.
And her officials say they want to reduce wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by growth in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is letting you know that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government created an agreement with bond holders who had previously refused debt restructuring, which Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now, President Fernández is facing an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes roughly $6,7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted on keeping this out of the IMF's sight, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" in order to design a new national consumer-price index, which will remind us of the introduction to the INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term of office when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of a middle class that is tired of Kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce the many views her husband held in politics.
Half Upbuilding for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted for mayors and city councils in five urban districts on 27 November, which could be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail over the mainland and have a strong establishment in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the greatest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only briefly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) ended up winning three out of the five mayor's offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors Taiwan's greater independence, has won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If this was a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote rate has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was together with KMT on city councils.
Elections took place like most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags with saved-dressed girls.
Part of it was even a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot a young Mr. Lien clean over his face, wounded him and killed a spectator.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls to the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Perhaps the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates argued about plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also abandoned the instigation of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the reality and awareness that China's trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma confirmed for his side that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would also like to see political integration, but first things first.
It would be better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President in 2000-08 was a rebel and supporter of clear independence.
But under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation has evolved, which is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been called as a candidate for the DPP as president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held the office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything it can to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their actions can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "confident alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed his opinion that the DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight to choose between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's evaluations were wrong, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
KMT spokesperson says he'll reorganize his cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan for establishing friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China essential.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed. "
Nomination to Grammy Award: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
The appearance at the request of the President and the people must inevitably notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer whom President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is referred to as one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, the nomination came a little late, but it's in accordance with the rules of Grammy, when the artist must not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" has certainly taken a step forward and thanks to its carefree vocal style and agile hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the nearest equivalent for Grammy voters looking for similar jazz work in this category over the last years.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental albums, an exciting, refreshing ride album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a crappy New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, with the knowledge of steampunk, has gained several well-deserved recognition in the category of large files, where the competition was the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octate of "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bass player can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards Nomination: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classic music
Nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" have the lead in the nomination as a piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California appeared Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles," a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The classic music producer category of the year has five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was received by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the project Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" showing various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyric Houston; Kaija Saaria and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wandererer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariensky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are nominated for Grammys for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Schedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
Approximately 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental performance of the soloist and orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said that he wrote a 15-minute work specially for Mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for conducting the Chicago Symphony while recording the works of Stravinsky.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, the soprano Jessy Norman was nominated for her "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives approval from the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
The critics attacked the project to promote terrorism and lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who oppose shout loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time took up discussions with people who were in favour or against the center. These voices were evenly divided, says Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Monkeys with the Statue of Liberty in the Sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also raised protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when the terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families suffered in Riverside County for years without incident, but wanted a larger and more suitable space than the warehouse space he rented together with the filter system manufacturer.
A new mosque with dimensions of 24 943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy a site of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the scope for finding new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered so far and fundamental.
"This organism has dual powers."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that it is a form of truly 'extraterrestrial' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
For a long time, six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur - were considered essential for life.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after being replaced by phosphorus for arsenic.
"It will start to amaze you as much as possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for the search for life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this novelty published in order to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the findings, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider 'standard' may not be so necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element to another in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it showed high arsenic levels.
The arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so it considered that the microbe, which is exposed to both elements, could be able to replace one after another.
"Arzen is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can be very difficult to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that it doesn't work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists gather bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic that bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in the action of phosphorus, but given that they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but there was never an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated that it could be used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth," Foster said, which was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.

The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four dog shows that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found and reported to the sheriff of Los Angeles on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities informed.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs then on Wednesday late evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not found to comment on the case.
They were very happy to find their two Akitas at the shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old male Trace and 10-month-old female Didi, were unharmed, told the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breed, who planned to participate in this week's regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned in the days before the exhibition AKC/Eukanaba show, said Peek daily The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop on almost a month of steam travel after dog shows.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside the room window.
They also took with them three dogs - boxer puppy, Parson Russell terrier and Brittany hounds - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in a car where it should have been colder.
They opened the windows a little so the dogs could get enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to missing dogs, and the dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether prices would be awarded.
The lion is once again ready to scream now that the restructuring of MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and insecurity, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, Federal Insolvency Judge New York officially blessed the "pre-wrapped" plan of creditors to settle about $5 billion of debt and thus clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing films and television shows.
By Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy order, MGM does not remain legal barriers to restarting the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will be leading the slim studio.
The number of employees will fall to approximately 320 of the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Capitol 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on the planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to finance new MGM operations and production.
It is now a link with an investment bank that needs $75 million itself and funding is expected around halfway through December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management fought to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
On that August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and turnover expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed to sell the company at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several candidates, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the funds demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, who collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive $4 million in reward for success.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which published only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, the draft of which will be the book Hobit, together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $ 265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, sought the possibility of combining his studies with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that will keep your budget for gifts balanced
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing toy iPad, followed by the video game system. In both cases, this is a significant impact on the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game Kinect costs as much as 10 beaded jumpers or approximately 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts balanced.
I recently visited three national toy dealers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was in place; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to last years.
While relatively fewer new toys appeared with associated websites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offers more.
The number of toys with button batteries as well as toys with batteries is increasing.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices shown are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases that are otherwise marked.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
At one press, the animal issues a tone, and the other press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
The best choice in combination singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animator doll on Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with bike blocking.
Kids test Mickey's toy dance instructor, although their parents complain about lack of volume control.
If you're a kid in the '80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn car ride into fun with a self-correcting, fun workbook.
If you're sneaking around after a smartphone for your baby, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with a simple use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not have as effective teaching as the Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubes that are not bigger than a matchbox, each of them has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing dice in a row before time runs out; it is great for competing in improvised word making.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in toy stores to the highest extent.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle animal.
A little bit larger than your toothbrush's brush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest from a series of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's funny when you make a maze out of dice and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very resilient.
Ours was able to fall down with the kitchen table and spend some time in our dog's mouth.
Introducing a Finer Police Control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and giving orders in a position of military authority.
He wanted feminine members - Chinese sturdy town-order enforcers, feared and despised for their hard actions and passion for violence - to convey a certain impression of the crowd around them.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what pretty girls look like!"
The four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood on guard.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged as ruler.
Four head covers fit perfectly on the hair that are perfectly bound by blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look mediocre," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered new recruits to have a university education.
Guangdong Province changed grey-green uniforms to supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China replaced staring for strong armor: in 2009, it was reported that 50 officers surrounded the van with snacks and looked at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose operation as the main painting.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its municipal police specifically selected according to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rude side of the police, also a softer, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would be in trouble to get into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce city regulations, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But China's media is usually seeing a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the Hubei province beat the non-participating spectator to death after using his cell phone to film how they were doing in the case of a protest against the landfill.
Last year there was a training of police officers in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual there was, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat up the perpetrator without blood marks.
This year, a door-to-door watermelon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online depicts Chinese policemen attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after another discussion on tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly cleansed. "
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After advertising the county in October for eight new female police officers, The Beijing Evening News discussed whether women have real responsibilities or are merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district demanded female applicants between 18 and 22 years of age with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion. "
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - that is, more than 1.6 metres.
The retirement age of 26 is compulsory.
Functionaries say that work is psychologically too demanding for women over 25 years of age.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed policeman at Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "internal quality."
Women are like flower vases, he said and added, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities. "
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city management, disagrees very much with this description.
But he noted that college requirements in China are also common for other jobs, both sexes.
Just like a request for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Healthily disabled or crippled will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchback to serve with us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps a watch on Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years old, faces like apples and softly shaped mouths.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance might have a sexist character, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her coworker with dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely driving traders into the alleys where they can pursue their activities.
Every morning, a group stands against more than ten thugs who are on foot or bikes trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, when the thug began to run, and for a time he left his bike with a noodle cart.
Cops describe their duties as more monotonous than laborious.
"Every day is basically the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing on her day off.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers as their male counterparts to confiscate the goods.
They can only threaten to report that fact to their male supervisor.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public acts of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan Province's capital, revolted after false rumors spread that policemen killed dealers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the hours of the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or lit.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where a police officer was patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
Cops confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike could have cried like he wanted.
A 15-minute standoff in front of the police, looking angry, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator assigned to a male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
As well as female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who already have only a helping role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and smoothing image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li in a matter of fact.
"Most of the time, it's the public who gets involved."
Prosecutors will not accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges involving his affair with a former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced on Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision concludes the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and which, until the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said that he was "surely pleased" by a decision that followed almost a year's investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Commission.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that he is not planning to press any further charges against him on this matter."
The Justice Department refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign was preparing a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in the New York Times in October 2009 stated that Mr Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, of the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr Ensign has contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after employing Mr Hampton to lobby for them, giving so much document and conversation.
As Hampton was until recently an assistant to Mr Ensign, he was expelled from his former employer's or Senate lobbying law for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that was published, "it turned out to be a clear case of lawbreaking," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr Brand and other lawyers specialising in ethics said that the Ministry was cautious in relation to political actions, after a large number of failures, including last year's decision to suspend the case against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of the charge of misconduct of the prosecutor's office.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Organization Citizens of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group that has lodged several complaints against Mr Ensign on the matter.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the law," she said.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he had been called by the Attorney General of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the Ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defense team is working with the plaintiff in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as he repeated in his office on Wednesday's statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had given to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable telling the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to put an end to an investigation into a separate complaint in which the ethics group is accusing the Ensign Hampton parents' payment of $96,000 to the federal electoral law.
The Election Commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing more than a gift.
One company for which Mr Ensign helped Mr Hampton find his lobbyist work was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that has long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr Hampton began to act as a lobbyist, head of staff of Mr Ensign - John Lopez - he communicated with Mr Hampton and told him that he was "buttling" into the Ministry of the Interior on the subject discussed.
Mr Ensign also attended lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegian Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr Hampton to do his lobby work.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the Senate's third term.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the target of investigating the crime, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hopes that the ethics commission will quickly follow the Justice Department and end the investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she said.
Cheshire's Call for Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the ranks of the courtroom.
One minute after a minute, they sent reports of horrible testimony through Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages dealt with rape and binding children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, a trial was held by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, the family, and was to be held an official termination with the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed appeals with applications and arguments that the court would probably have employed for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter's main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then introduced the jury in a decision in terms of public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether the emergence of new technologies would also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr.
The judge of the trial Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claim concerning the yield of last week and the fact that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have acknowledged that reporting of notorious cases may raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court annulled the conviction of the Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, it was a "carnival atmosphere" in the media trial.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration of the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Hayes' judgment half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine the way in which the courtrooms were to communicate, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, Professor of Law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was performed arbitraryly.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is only one of Mr. Hayes's many outlined lawyers who would have been able to argue for years to delay the execution of the judgment.
For example, defense attorneys also claim that Mr. Hayes may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential judges by showing them criminal photographs of terror in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors reported that they were appalled by the photos of the victim Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Defendants argue that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly called off the juror who was critical of the prosecutors and that by his decision he misplaced more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The judges weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They argued in their objection to the verdict raised last month that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly stirring up the flames of emotion about this case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras, and reporters in court," wrote the lawyer, "was something that was not yet seen here in New Haven and maybe it is also a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports presented later and, from their point of view, the judicial police should control the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers have demanded appeals courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adjustments to the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the scope of the process, and wanted to clarify the demand that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its insult and negativity, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusion moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders brought no major discoveries on the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences of opinion of two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party fights.
The President's deficit commission's Wednesday public meeting was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close synergies over a few months have built up mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological gap that still divides members.
And it's quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the test period - probe each other for signs of collegiateness and compromise, while trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting and its later evaluation were also performed by participants, with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to propose a rapid change in the conditions that have been prevailing here for the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, spending, healthcare or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, Washington prepared the November election at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"These are inevitable after the election.
Elections roused the party's emotions, and then they stopped.
It's okay."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts ran out at the end of the year, and nobody thinks it's a good thing.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because Republicans cannot look at how they support tax reductions for the wealthy, while the unemployed refuse unemployment support.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is already more optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening agreement.
But William Galston of Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties when the 112th Congress is convened for January.
Rather, it is likely a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that courtesy will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely linked to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders are now facing the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act on their promises and must reduce government spending and abolish the new law on health care.
These lines are clear in the initial responses to deficit recommendations, which include reform of the tax code and increasing certain taxes, increasing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
The joint chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of Washington's most difficult tasks and have, in their opinion, put pressure on deficit issues to the public programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member committee so that they can present their plan as official recommendations and fight to get as close as possible to this number.
The greatest resistance is between elected jury officials who suggest that we have, at least today, a small foundation or a will for compromise in the case of financial questions.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when the Republicans will call on Obama to address the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the partiality of the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could be directed towards the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very closely monitoring public reactions.
Whoever is threatened with a vote reduction will probably change course and seek compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of things.
Today, partyism and direction are greater than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there was a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than there was in the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has appeared this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost much effort on both sides to find common foundations on issues that still divide them.
A betrayed American document depicts Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of the "kultocracy" and it continues with part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia reported in the February record.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are holding large-scale security wings to help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal business but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - takes its own when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The entry sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and blamed him for a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in purification.
For many years, Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturin, who owns a prominent construction company, have constantly denied corruption charges, and has won several charges for perjury for such accusations.
In September, he said at a Russian television station when he was asked to testify about corruption: "It's crazy, it's filth, it's crap. "
The Russians, with absolute conviction, believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
It is unusual, however, to meet such details in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of Moscow and its connection with the criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional' and confirm that the government acts more like kleptocracy than the government," the report says.
"Criminal Elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'crysha' (the term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection') provided by the police, Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the State Attorney, as well as everywhere in Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"The analysts identified and three-stage structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of Interior and the militia are in second grade."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in empty spaces in certain areas, as the city does not provide certain services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies, and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "the owners of shops in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (better than from organized criminal groups) because they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself may already be in trouble; even those paying may sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay quickly enough, their business is closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about combating corruption, but he admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably loaded with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow research team in India in a recent interview.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no longer part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that Russia's corruption costs more than $300 billion a year.
Countries rank 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (the countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the report of the American Embassy, which appeared in Moscow only in late evenings, certainly did not cause enthusiasm for the Russian government, although only to the point that Luzhkov may be accused of Moscow's shortcomings, it may be an option for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
During an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin said that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been counterfeits and responded angryly to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The truth about the matter is that it is our mutual interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
The Khmer Red veterans are forced to deal with the past.
The director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality during Khmer Red government, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Red possession in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Reds gave up their government, long-term loyalty is also hacked in Anlong Vengo.
In April, victims in the forum of truth and reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that first explain the history of the Khmer Reds and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court of First Conviction of the former Khmer member, handed down by the former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such progress, there was growing unrest among the Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts to reconcile and their attempts to rejoin Cambodian society.
"There is hatred and fear among the former Khmer Reds, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Center, an independent organization that is investigating the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Reds was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Red Government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or starved, sick or overworked.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara led guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlong Vengo.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Khmer Red fighters began to move to the government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured in 1999 by government forces in the nearby Dangrek mountains.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
Their benefactors no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Red Warriors fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Reds have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their positions remain weak, as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefit from surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were brought up without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Reds as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Reds was good," he said.
"The Mok has fed everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we have to secure everything ourselves."
The Khmer Red Court also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the trial will begin to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer minister.
The Court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was very little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, a regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during Khmer Red Government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project on which thousands of forced workers were likely killed.
A recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the field to her wooden house on a dirty journey outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Reds.
If the court had summoned her, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are any more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Reds in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court sought other suspects, although experts and historians disagreed.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chang Youk from the documentation center.
"Conciliation in Khmer proportions means sticking broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand ourselves."
The Centre published the first textbook approved by the Government on Khmer Rouge, with 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages of the Khmer Reds.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Vengo knew only a few details about the Khmer Reds, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, high school student at Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more difficult and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks and courts are beginning to influence, he said further.
The Khmer Reds still have a powerful spell here.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is a path covered with weeds and dumped plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle made of black soot covered with rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, mobile saleswoman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated in that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pota's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to be its uranium-based weapons reserves
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would give up their reserves of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued following the security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that they encountered a stone of injury last spring.
But American officials have told The Washington Post that a few classified operations have been conducted with Belarus in the last two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, nuclear safety support groups.
Clinton called the deal "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their reserves of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenka said.
"It's our commodity...we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago and showed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, announced by officials.
He was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, said the officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, said the officials.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on delivering less enriched uranium to the Belarusian Research Institute, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
This year, James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-proliferation Studies estimated that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium usable in the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, endeavour to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, especially because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government didn't make it hard to fly the CIA.
The Spanish government did not make a big deal about CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and members of Al-Qaeda to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid expressed in his telegram.
This follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks server El País, where it is also said that the first Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus show that she had proper supervision of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace'.
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of participating in human rights violations, a meeting took place between Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "snatched the Zapater government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with secret service flights across its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" in order to "not be caught unprepared," says Aguirre in one of the documents.
At that time, Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible outlines, but by being in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited influence options".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he is concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the uncovering of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence regarding CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating file or sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns about the "clear coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the disclosure of information to CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly among governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he had already given instructions to his co-workers "to avoid heated comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - note) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any hints that the Zapatera government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if these revelations might have negative consequences for the United States government" he notes.
Admitted mother-murderer complained on the network on her mother's "worry"
A young woman spoke of a child when it was already dead, and she had her blog: "Galicia Terror"
Monica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
she has been communicating with her cousin and at least one friend with this nickname, which she has been using since she was young; both of them are from Noia, La Coruna, where a young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, the woman's emotional life that the journal ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members must be known.
In 1998, a 30 - year - old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Iván Tunez.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had her DNA tested.
Before long, she found a new girlfriend.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Louisame.
It took a long time for them to live together.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palma.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is some angry that I left for work. "
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he has to be with the little all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about a text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you a baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only going to stay until 19th, because 20th I have to go to work so I don't lose the job."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son with him.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, with me, and it'll never happen again in my life that I'll leave him with anyone other than my mother," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When he taps this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Cesar is satisfied on one side, but on the other, he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Majorca.
"He'll go to summer school there, so I'll save a little money for the babysitter."
The 17th greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what videos he emailed you, look how he wants to meet me, sex is needed."
Another report on the 30th: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan. "
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner, "He's giving me money."
On the Internet are Monica's posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called herself "Muki ex-inmate."
"Galicia Terror (motto) '.
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses her remorse and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened and "that she didn't intend to hurt the little one in any way."
But before that, she admitted that she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric examination.
The People's Party would gain 4 seats in the House and PSC would lose 9 mandates
with the results of November 28th, the PP party could have the lead at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the votes gained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia - a footnote) already has a given idea of universal elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in national elections is usually similar once compared to Catalan elections.
In 2008, Catalan people received 610.473 votes in the general election, whereas in the 2006 autonomous elections, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384.091 votes.
If this trend of increases is maintained, which was supported by the transfer of votes from PSC and the loyalty of the voters PP, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could obtain 12 Members in the House compared to the current 8, the CiU party (Convergencia i Unió, Czech Match and Union - notes by the fact that it would also obtain 4 mandates (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is crucial for PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) parties.
According to this analysis of the people's people, the ERC would lose one member - now having a 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia - footnotes) would still have one mandate, or another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest meeting will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the folks could also have a decisive influence on the end of socialist domination in four major provincial cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest budget envisaged - 661 million euro for 2011.
Both nationalists and folks agree that PSC could lose city halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not receive the majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - because at least 5% of the votes have to be obtained.
PP has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe that they could play a major role in the Tarragon turnaround, where they ruled alongside the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP won only 500 more votes than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The People's Party also acquired at other major city halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
currently has PP representation at 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to the Al Qaeda organization
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were arrested in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and a Nigerian who were detained by agents from the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which provided passports to various Al-Qaeda groups, among which were also "Tigers of Liberation of Tamil Eelam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba," the second appointed group being the author of the bombings in Mumbai, where 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure, through the "operation of Kampai," that Al-Qaeda's counterfeit apparatus is weakened at international level and that it is able to limit its operational capabilities.
Investigators estimate that this cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then forged and then delivered to groups that form the Al-Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their "warriors" could travel across borders with impunity in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units were also involved in these investigations other than Thai services, and therefore it cannot be excluded that there will not be similar interventions in other European countries in the coming days, as was the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another in Thailand, in which Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thaian Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were captured.
It was these men who drove a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, the part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that documents must belong to men aged 25 to 45 years, must have been valid for several years and be free of marked visas.
In the investigation documents, it is pointed out that no facts are yet known to link the detainees from Catalonia to the bombing in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba," should have been one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency that was "planted" to buy cards on mobile phones that were later used by members of the "comand" that killed 106 people.
The police have already confiscated a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mas to stop the fiscal agreement
PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchez-Camach yesterday had the opportunity to present herself to Arturo Mas her conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during her mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party came to meet Arthur Mas with a certainty of 18 seats received in last Sunday's elections, which is more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, therefore the candidate CiU needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment to office.
The possible agreement with PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when general elections are held, but so far, the talks that the Mas and the rest of the political leaders are being held in the Catalan spirit.
As far as the PP President is concerned, in order to gain her support for the commission, "he will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches," as well as to an economic agreement - similar to that of the Basque Country - about which CiU's leader even wanted to put to the vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slimn the overgrown political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of negotiations regarding Masov's deployment will be dealt with within PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today meets Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that deaths were not due to "lack of action"
Olot Centre's performances do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution of criminal behavior of Joan Vilma Dilmé, a caretaker who, while employed here, killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
The director of this senior home, Joan Sala, accompanied by a lawyer, Joan Canada's attorney, announced that "by wishing La Caritat's home would be able to press charges against the culprit responsible for the killing, but "legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities."
In addition to damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it did not reveal the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the great threat to La Caritat's home is now the requirements for material compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already occurred in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight elderly home clients with suspicion that in many cases no doctor looked at the deceased personally, but that - given the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat resolutely rejected this extreme through his director yesterday and stressed that "the lack of measures could not in any way have been the cause of what had happened. "
Lawyer La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party, other than his own accused person, would have committed misconduct'.
A man nicknamed "The Angel of Death" confessed his death yesterday 11 and stated that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, death caused too much insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of soothing tablets.
Director La Caritat said it was difficult to control the access of staff to medication.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were probably six out of the nine means used by this caregiver to kill patients in an effort to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses currently carried out in the laboratory should show whether the Villa was lying and actually sought less cruel death for its first victims or killed them by serving lye, as he had already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they don't believe a paramedic's claim, nor do they rule out that the number of killed may be higher than the one he confessed to, and justify his behavior in the various versions he gave to the court, knowing that he had to change his actions when it came out that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say that they want to be available to the judiciary to light up the whole scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Last night, investors reacted sharply to yesterday's threat to President Trichet of the European Central Bank, who pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Border differentials have closed down by force and European bank shares have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It'll take the investor some time to lose his concern.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity ratio today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the State debt buy-back plan for inefficiency and elimination of all exceptional liquidity measures within a period of time, leaving unlimited access for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate of forecasts "at least by March" and will comply with a three-month license with unlimited access to the end of this trimester in order to guarantee liquidity at least by June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and even announce its intensifying.
If they fail to meet the expectations created, they will re-establish the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity ratio, God will be with us!
The same was true at the convention in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a market collapse -- tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, it was announced by the armored fist on Monday and on Wednesday it announced that it had already purchased many, causing a further market collapse.
Yesterday's one-year notes were a very poor one in Portugal.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell 30 points below, reflecting the change in mood in the market that occurred after the words of Trichet.
in Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent around 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the problem has not been identified in July by stress tests, amounts are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need the approval of the new budget by Parliament and it still does not have sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel eased the tone of her speech in order to ease the tension in the face for the next EU summit on 14 December, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are a Union and we are all on the same team.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others prefer Beethoven's Ode to joy.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - to investors' ears sounds like four seasons since Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish exchange increased by 4,5%, twice as much as other European exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the effect of surprises.
Today, we have a key bond licensing for three years, which will benefit from the effects of Trichet, which we hope will be a great demand for, which will help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - high rates and market access would close to sine die.
However, Cesar's wife's strategy must continue to be used - "not only to be that, but also to seem that way. "
We can do this.
The President of the Eulen Group will attack the Vega Sicilia meeting requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, will not cease.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after he has taken him for "totally meaningless," the legal act of El Enebro planned for the 16th of this month and the requested five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize with the help of the administrative authorities of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia prosecution.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José set up a legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company of corporate services does not seem willing to back down in his dispute about membership of the ruling bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven descendants were removed from its administration committee, who were named foreman during the shareholders' assembly on 18 January of this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register.
The court hearing of the El Enebro group scheduled for the 16th of this month, convened by the official of Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, restored the thunderstorm in the belly of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means until the dispute is resolved that guarantees the commission's summoning.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira Álvarez's Mesquiriz is considered by David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of judicial deceit and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the negotiations of January 18, which was totally invalid"
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this act as "totally insignificant'.
The protagonists themselves, who secretly remain silent, have already tried without success to bring the court together in June.
In El Enebro, a group that owns, alongside other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right to use 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue which the judge will have to decide in the trial of the issue of court assault, and the date of the hearing has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs improvements in real-time vehicles.
Ever since Red Bull invaded Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this newcomer team too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, the world of Formula 1 was born a legend - a "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens placed in the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for the purpose of a very distant car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in energy plants and for high precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenditures.
The PLM has facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens's industrial division, explains that using this software device enabled Red Bull team to perform "within a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements, which are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except for the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser production systems and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical convenience is $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a top technology plant for designing and manufacturing its racing cars about 50 km from London.
These are two buildings where visitors are restricted - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "great secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
However, other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, are hidden behind the immeasurable technological means that the brand of energy drinks has put into their participation in the racing circuits.
The head of production technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was due to the riders.
at present this ratio has changed and technology is worth the success of 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology because they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 own stores within two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her business partner Pont Reyes opened its first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the network of 20 transactions of between 80 and 100 m2 which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 already existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice President of Spain, HP Helena Herrerová, has set an example of a newly converted store in Gran Vía, Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company prepared a plan to set up 200 sales points in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the shop in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, however, she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrera, who also runs HP personnel systems, assured that the business opening philosophy would still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises on exclusive design of shop equipment (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with securing staff for business.
Helena Herrera denied that it was franchising and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "enhanc customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging"
Trade in Barcelona is part of the pilot pioneer program at world level, which aims to address possible problems with computer devices under warranty.
Online service is connected to a technical centre based in Maastricht (The Netherlands).
"So we can solve problems within 10 minutes, which may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have contractual service of technical assistance," emphasized Helena Herrerová yesterday.
Sabadell bets on "stealing" a million clients in three years
More optimistic than other bosses, a delegated board member of Banco Sabadell Bank, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a reduction in interest rates, which will, however, try to compensate by discounting bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to acquire a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years to survive under difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with effect for three years.
The aim is, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by capturing millions of new private clients - or 700,000 if those who eventually leave the bank - as up until now the Institute has been pampering small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the plan 2011-2013 is a commitment to productivity, or one can also say sobriety, in order to reduce costs, whose call will be shown by the bank when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, a number of banking institutions dare set targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all of the world banking plans.
This year, Sabadell will close its Optima programme, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required expansion for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At an APIE meeting, Guardiol insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important."
Indeed, he believes that the way out of Spain's crisis "will be lengthy. "
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that a passive war - which reduces margins - is retreating, the price of the premium for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thereby compensating for the reduction in margins.
"The liquidity and financing team is structural and will constitute a pressure factor for loans'.
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that banking tendencies "now are reducing commissions" but there is a "competitive framework."
Bank Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that Spain "will demand greater sizes. "
"Next year he won't stay on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "a lot reduced" and does not exclude some of the Spanish institutions entering red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can substitutate the collection of funds on the market before the new capital measure.
Following the assurance that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis continues to pose a serious problem.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, short-term financing can be obtained by means of repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of savings pool fusion
CECA's CEO refused yesterday that there should be another wave of savings banks merger, and once again insisted on the speed at which the sector was reorganized.
When the process of grouping Spanish savings banks began, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Casasol into the group of Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as the second round, what is happening is the convention."
"Most of them are completely implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this matter" remarked the Director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting, Olavarieta stated that the concentration process is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as is reported in instalments, which, not now, have appeared in the Spanish National Bank's business plans'.
"Going from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that does not have a comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that these are larger and thus in accordance with the Basel Treaty" underlined.
Olavarieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not very happy opinions about the slowness of the process" that show "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on schedule before the end of the year."
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain had the strictest financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world as well, and he attributed "lack of knowledge" to those questioning it.
The director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks, as well as the system that has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and which continues with the "highest possible speed."
It also pointed out that Spanish banking came out very well of the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and Red German Line
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has set conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, to the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the abolition of 426 euro for unemployed people without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic control - exemplified), Barajas and El Prat airport managers and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, joined the criticisms to the address of Chancellor Angela Merkel because of her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Let us say in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is about the idea of following the old traditions held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to the mark - although it may now appear to be a science fiction, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is to redefine the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigour, fines for the guilty states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and to extend the possible cost of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time now, so there is no room for spinning now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission incited deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform from its sleeve to prevent them from becoming involved since 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered right (the fiscal rigidity plans and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country when Merkel painfully stretched out decisions about saving Greece.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again appeared with a clear view when it called for the reform of the European Union Conventions to enable the rescue of a Member State and, at the same time, for private creditors to be obliged to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although somewhat moderated, has been approved, and we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has set a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he tells us all that, although there is now a need to take measures that seem too disagreeable, from this date on, the old operation of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new monetary zone in which the rule-breaking countries will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report the delay of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is telling us that we need to take a strict path of growth with an increase in savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge balance of payments gaps, as ruled in Spain's growth boom, is simply not going to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not only a renewal of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could be wrong about ourselves.
I hope these current turbulence will take over the peace of mind.
And that we'll take advantage of the opportunity they're giving us until spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this, and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting with the big businesses last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that despite the criticisms to Merkel, the idea that things need to be put in order has opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem to want to move it.
And out of the possibilities that can be considered, leaving the euro area full of not very serious countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The Finns, like Alonso and Ramos did in the fight with Ajax, show ingenuity, not intent to escape punishment.
Concealed by the exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Ajax Champions League match of 23 November, it caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behavior, and whether or not UEFA should punish both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had clearly won) appointed players one by one deliberately wasted their time when they were supposed to play the foul to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in their group leading - and will be able to, de-carded, continue to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Board gave coach José Mourinh a two-game sentence and the guilty players received a cash penalty.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, rules that are unwritten, but are being watched.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the team Real Madrid (which boasts in its anthem of generosity and honor, and which has already fined its players for similar actions), and apparently also due to the drama led by Mourinh, who thus adds another episode to his long history of comedy and provocateur.
in any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of action, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is circumvention in these acts; indeed, it is an action that respects the sports rules, whose meaning seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is discussed what type of damage such actions cause to the spirit of sport.
One of the essentials of sports behavior is the physical integrity of the opponents, which has not been violated in these cases, or there has been no violent game.
Another of these features characterizing a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over the opponent team because of their offense - which did not happen here either.
Thus, paradoxical to the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as a ruse or circumventing the law has not been a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should have been as evident as possible with the aim of obtaining the penalty.
They waited, and they like to get punished.
The next question, however, is what advantage the culprits will have from their deliberate transgression.
It must be noted here that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that he will not get any benefit in the current match, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
Obviously, the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from the long-term perspective and with some degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance the team can be eliminated, and beyond that, the players will be punished, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which one card less than the first round is enough to be excluded.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be quite clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, and well, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow maximum benefit to be obtained under the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, players were not intended to avoid being punished (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between wit and bypassing the rules is not very clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-excretion and the way in which the transfer of instructions was carried out to provoke them away from the lead.
The damage to sports principles by these events is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers about holding Christmas parties in Barcelona
Dictate calendar concentrates this year's avalanche reservations on 16th and 17th December.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid by employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December, pre-Christmas parties that still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona come again, but the crisis has led to the fight to win clients by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complexity of the calculus, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) the requests for a week from 13 December, creating an avalanche reservation for the days at peak (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been happening since 2008, when thin years began, there are many companies that canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon tradition, many employees pay their own expense at parties.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of load capacity, claims the president of the Gremi de Restauraceó de Barcelona Restaurant Association, Gaieta Farras.
At the moment, the representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will think twice before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to the topic of prices, they are careful," he adds.
Businesses will go well to those "who offer quality and good service at a favorable price," says and reminds that due to the crisis customers tend to go down by a degree and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey in various facilities shows that the biggest rush of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
Soteras Group announces a real boom booking for this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, adjusted by offered menus whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another major company, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar of more early reservations since the beginning of November.
"We have made possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," are reported.
In the AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and total of 23 businesses, they remain optimistic after they have seen an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The sources of this company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as before-Christmas celebrations among friends will take place.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they noticed a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as Cava (Spanish sparkling wine - note p.o.).
They also noted that companies are already appearing, which are inviting their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Vice-President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "animated" although clients "compromise to the maximum."
Even during Christmas celebrations, this impression did not subside, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program spawned great unrest in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country.
The Wikileaks documents confirm the ties between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department published by the Wikileaks portal confirms the extraordinary unrest that is instigating Pakistan's nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the explaining and important details that they offer regarding the content of communications and ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, in terms of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, is "retreating" and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after works to make their destruction more difficult in the event of an attack - represents one of Washington's main reasons for being vigilant.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan in a report before a visit by then national security advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and vulnerability to the transport of nuclear materials'.
The increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenals and missile-controlled programs is no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as spreading and representing a reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or missile-controlled programs," said Yuri Korolev, an expert from the Russian State Department at a meeting with their counterparts from the US.
The biggest novelty of the documentation published by Julian Assange's server is increasingly less cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and an increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
The messages issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating', argue: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected'.
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other state in the world. "
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "explain very well" that "the Pakistani army must put an end to the silent support of terrorist groups" during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's army.
Hunting for Chief Wikileaks
Obama will appoint a high-ranking anti-terrorist worker to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red challenge" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about the Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday an "extraordinary challenge" called the red notice, to "localize and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' attorney Mark Stephens assures that "police knows where and how to contact Mr Assang."
It was November 20th, when an international police force based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday when it received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have guidelines on the identification or localisation of Assange "in order to place a temporary link on him and issue him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a red caller, many Member States, as explained by the organisation, regard the so-called red notice as allowing the arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially if the states have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be located.
This step was offended by Assenge's lawyers, who published a letter yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of her case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentius Pavlovich Berija, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit," states the letter.
While the whole world is searching for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, however, does not silence.
On Monday, he interviewed Time magazine editor-in-chief through Skype from an unknown location - Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State called for the resignation of US Secretary of State in this interview.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the UN in violation of international conventions signed by the United States, she should withdraw," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press spokesperson Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demise demand as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he said for CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a high-ranking anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will chair the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the Foreign Ministry to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks as a terrorist organization "to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Even further, Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's advisor, said that Assange should be "killed," which he subsequently had to withdraw.
"Both should put a bounty on him or use a drone or something."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the government, who is responsible for leaking information, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," Fox said.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC by "blinking" on Carod's sidekick
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its staying.
Huguet proposes more plural executives and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós appears to have found a recipe for fighting several internal revolts in the ECR (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia) which has been lost to 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party's chairman is aware that his gesture of demise seems inadequate to the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its leader, and that he absolutely cannot worry as much as he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms by blinking, which will help him armor himself into municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to speak secretly to remain in office.
With ballots, not by raising your hand.
If Carod's supporters want to turn over a criminal vote to the chairman, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the division and subjugation of his person.
In several interviews he argued that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the vote and one more, but he added, without specifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria."
Carod's supporters demand more from the chairman than to make his position available - a gesture they consider to have no weight because Puigcercós controls the largest body at the conventions.
But since they do not have the majority to enforce demise, they will try to remind the executives of the plan from now until May.
This is why they expect to participate in the drafting of a document on strategic reorientation, on which the management will vote to the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercous in exchange for promising to move the congress in autumn 2011.
The ECR leader stated that "many vocals" are damaging stability, and that its goal is that once and for all the organization is able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
in this context, it seems to be a distinctive article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercós's ideology, this innovation consultant took the case that the leader would be confirmed by "the exchange for several goals."
And he named them five, two of which stand out.
The first is to "compose" executives to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces that are in favor of Carod.
The second target can be a big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should completely end its meetings as a mechanism of operation.
So he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by the vote.
The end of the meeting system model, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 Hamstery Assembly decided that the meeting had to be assessed at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged the solution to this matter.
Now, without the lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to revisit this matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico had a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, as reported in the MILENIO.
Between the murders, there are three women's cases and a couple of separate bodies found in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are a total of 390 killings in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, Toluca district.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, further a gunshot wound from grace to the head, with her hands and legs chained by a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlan colony, in the Naucalpan district.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, the cooperative discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the section of Villa Guerrero County.
Next to the body was a report signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nehualcóyotl, a 50 - year - old man was murdered with eight shots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two victims were shot in the head at the age of 30 in San Pedro Xalaxtoc, Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, a corpse of a man shot in the forehead was found on a remote road in the El Naranjo Colony, and a shell casing from a 25 caliber gun was found under the body.
parts of the human body were found in the sewage channel in the Playa Golondrin colony.
Paramedics did a thorough search for other parts of it, but they didn't find them.
Tepotzotlan residents reported a body found with their hands tied backwards and their head wrapped around Pen Colorado's location.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in Atizapán de Zaragoza County were reported threatening death.
A day later, she was found in the Valle de los Reyes Colony in Los Reyes County, a cardboard box that contained a human head.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the Zoquiapan settlement in the Ixtapaluca district, and the next morning, a man was found killed in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was preliminary to the report left by the killers on his body, identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in San Francisco Acuautla with no life signs with two wounds to the back of her neck.
A tattoo of the sacred Santa Muerte character (literally "Holy Death" - note) and necklaces with its likeness was discovered on the skin of the woman.
At the end of the month, a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in a car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found with their heads wrapped in tape and a report was also found in Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim's report was probably one of the criminal organizations in which it said: "This will happen to those who will not adapt. "
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, which bore signs of torture and had her limbs tied inside an abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month were found the remains of two men in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl districts.
The first one was beheaded and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and had a message left with him; while the second one was tortured and found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents found a note with a note.
China adheres to its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
At the UN Climate Change Conference, the country's representative assured COP16 that its country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprint and stated that it insisted on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, reassured Su Wei, a representative of this country at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country has already invested 245 million dollars in the last four years trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he has made it clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work on this with the international community.
He referred to China's climate change strategy as being divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
On all these points, they have already seen progress, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
He also stressed that in China, the federal authorities collaborated in a coordinated manner with provincial and local authorities to achieve their targets in terms of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
Furthermore, as he said, the various plans have already been implemented or have been completed for several years, which are financed by both the GOC and the governments of other states.
For example, as he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years, has received investments from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also underway, and the project to exchange fluorescent lamps for energy saving bulbs and the project to mitigate and adapt, has been clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, an expert advisor to this country for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than in general thought.
For example, he described greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects it to make further progress by 2020.
Espin's expulsion: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Accion Nacional, Czech National Action Party - note překl.) said that the former chairman of this party is entitled to demand from the National Order Commission his right.
The National Chairman of the PAN Party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been enacted and that the former President of that party was entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and demand his right.
In an interview taken before the objection was raised by the Governor of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espin was in any case a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the National Council Order Commission in order to be a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that there has never been an alliance presidential nomination at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will come out of the internal elections held following December 4 and 5 in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose" he pointed out.
The Chairman of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue have been behind him, so "we are not frightened by internal competition, on the contrary we benefit from it and strengthen us" he added.
He said that the committee would be able to elect the best president or chairwoman who deserves PAN for the next three years, so he would pass the relay on to "who will be appointed by the committee."
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of the five I will proudly hand over the party chairman's office."
He predicted that the rise recorded by the party in the last elections of July would be reflected in future clans, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will be a flag and will be the subject of sightings throughout the country, as "there are many expectations and desires put in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to these expectations."
When we asked him about criticisms by President Felipe Calderón on the part of PRI (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, p.o.k.a.)) because of his speeches within the four years that reign, César Nava called upon members of PRI to think about six years of former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If they believe in PRI that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the rule of Fox and Claderón, let them begin to defend them, let them come out of their shell," he confessed.
He said that the head of federal executive power has the right to express himself as he did during his speech in the National Auditorium, since there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes a law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve it", the US President tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama has now joined the national mobilisation to support the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve it," tweeted Obama.
His short report draws attention to the Internet reference to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact the senators without delay, as the vote on this bill is coming.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless an extension of the Bush era tax reductions and government funding was approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the President's spokesperson said that he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be drawn up.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we have a tax issue to settle before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement on this matter and then we can plan the order of the other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Harry Reid Senate announced on Tuesday that it would request a 'vote to close the debate' on the Dream Act, so that the proposal to legalise students without documents could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
The Senatorial Approval of the Dream Act, or "American Dream " Act, would legalize some 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the completion of 16 years, resided in the country over the last five years and were admitted to an institution of higher education or to an army.
However, the supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, so they need the help of several Republicans, so that the organizations of its supporters carry out intense agitation in order to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats most of whom support the Dream Act have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said that he will vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act need to obtain several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters negotiate most are the Senators of Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida, George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they said that they would not support it again.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet spoken.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward another version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature inserting the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga," translated "put the finger into the wound" is similar to the Czech "punch the nail on the head - note překl.)
The second round of the cycle Pleasure from the language was the promenade where the participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... Finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked author Luisa Valenzuelová, who was invited to open the second round of Pleasure in the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair at the round table they addressed the topic Sex in the language, explained).
The finger in the wound "brings us to the narrow" was delivered by a lovely Argentine writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to listen to this round table debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text she gave to Gonzalo Celoria, and which Schultz then described as a great story in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonists who, in searching for the knowledge of what "the wound " is from a doctor to a doctor from whom she does not receive answers, although the traces of the same story do.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, it may be my wound. "
Finally, after frustration with the traumaologist, who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, he is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound is truly open and the scar is symbolic."
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she only managed to learn so much about the wound that it was really open and that it doesn't exist," but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played both.
Nicaragua Sergio Ramírez also performed with a delightful narration, which he called the Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but at one point appears.
With the elements of magical realism, it tells of a famous witch who played clouds, bringing back people who had gone far away, or corrected the honesty that one virgin had lost, this tale that then turned to speak America, a great novel in which his own chroniclers who had told it from the beginning did not miss, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes exaggeration in the story of conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (writers), mocked by a fake testimony that was presented in stories as real, but in other ways never managed to tell the story of America with such an imagery that lacked even shame."
However, he emphasized, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and exactly where the reality and the lie merge, where it is no longer known what of the story belongs to one group and what into another, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
That's what he calls a "cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Then Mayra Monterová emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations which allowed the invitation of the International Book Fair with her discussion Finger to the wound.
A Cuban-portorist writer pointed her finger at a major blow to social violence that goes through her country - and shares it with Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise, which, of course, is not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and readers - and in their "chemical response."
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer."
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and the control of consciousness that overflows with dogmatisms, it is forgotten that "a small no is hidden behind each approach, and there is also a small yes after every denial. "
"To be master of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and color means many times inserting a finger into the wound and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and harassing the authorities who prefer this black and white world," he said to promote the purpose of writing.
Romano goes to his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the finals, during his career he experienced both good and bad, but he was able to achieve on three occasions on a decisive series.
In the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finals, there will also be two different styles with their techniques, teams that have a distinct difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has been able to achieve a decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has left with an unfinished one, which is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinean had to settle for the silver medal, he remained a step behind the winner, and he played curiously with the same team following the finale.
As a coach, the Santa strategist got to his first finale in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had the reins of Morelia, with which he succumbed to a total of 4-2 against Tolution; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament again advanced to a decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Smokers" (another nickname of the Deportivo Toluca club - note the over) after 210 minutes of the game indecisively 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings got into the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but finally his three players missed from 11 steps and the team thus suffered a turn on 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says it is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I owe, and the title would, of course, also be for me, but the first is the most important," said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak out in the final against him.
in a vivid memory he has the previous finale, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned a lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as players, because last time with two penalties, we were ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that we have learned in this until the game is over, we can't celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes in his players: "You never try to reach a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be prepared, in the last tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately our fate has prepared a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left something in us and hopefully something like this will not happen."
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other person and taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
The United States amends the rules for issuing visas
People will have to turn to the Centres of the Services for Visa Applicants before interviewing the Consul Unit; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa process will be changed at the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Centres for Visa Applicants (shortly from ASC English) before interviewing the Conservative Department.
The staff from the ASC will collect biometric information from the applicant and they will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of handling the visa will be lower, no longer necessary to pay the fee for the appointment, the second for the processing of the application and other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go through an interview with a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and will be fingerprinted.
Given that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second interview with the Conservative Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra charge for the service of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by experts on astrobiology, science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the press, NASA assured that they would present "a discovery that would cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life, " which aroused speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us living in inhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and which could represent the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creature uses arsenic for its life, and its ability increases the likelihood that such life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another, a second life form, different from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the real reach of discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón are producing an opposition "block "
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism," they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period was not even begun when the opposition bloc was created in Congress, led by members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revolutionarya, Czech "Page of the Democratic Revolution" - note p.m.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Práce Party" - note p.m.), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda" p.m.) and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" in the House.
Prior to the beginning of the session at the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period of Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "slumber" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, "bapartism" begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santosova Aquilarova, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by PAN (Partido Accion, Czech National Action Party) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally form political marginality from the impulse of the PRI parties (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He specified that during the following days they would be talking to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they would again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When the opposition coalition has arrived, I am looking at it because we are excluded from any decision, not even willing to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, by Convergencia, stated that PRD, PT, and Patrón are in agreement and will therefore form a pluralist group.
It is not possible to allow Congress, after being monopolistic, to be now "duopole".
The aspirations of the reform of the law are not for endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators, and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, as Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained by PT that at present Congress has become a "crust" of two - in the innuendo of PAN and PRI.
"In the past, there was only one party controlling it, and today it is divided by two."
Patrón Montalvo asked for respect for the Member's personality to be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order that the five Members, who are likely to be nine, see us now at five, do not stay away from the vaulted agreements, each in another faction, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have formed and agreed, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
A further 200,000 pesos are issued for "contractor"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check to the company owner who supplied the electrical material.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent to the town hall by Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This means that the sum paid in this second half to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material will climb to 1.200.000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, it was exposed to the amount of 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject was mentioned "compensation of outstanding payments."
The cashier Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, who was followed by the Supreme State Review Office for sale at high prices, another amount.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last November 16.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Letter, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Review Office, in order to prevent other administrative authorities from using their services, the treasurer has assured that she has not used the City Hall's supplier's services again.
In the past, after 25 July, Noroeste published a revision of the checks issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camachová's town of Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques between March 2008 and July 2010.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places urgently need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the bad condition of the Sánchez Taboad's dance in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist to the pit at the Sánchez Taboada beach, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asks authorities to pay attention to areas and places in bad shape and do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, reminded them repeatedly to ask for the impression of the destination, and the bad things that tourists find here to replace it with new activities or routes.
He stated that the bad condition of the streets and pavements affects tourists who are walking around and seeing a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Policies don't know what it's like to shut down a business for one day, and they don't have an idea of the sales they're leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these matters that long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance from the town hall.
"The city hall will have to assume responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to engage in preventive maintenance, not merely repair existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy clean cities, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its maintenance strategy."
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, remarked, such as the Emblém and El Venadito, the statue of the deer - note.
"Nowadays, in order for tourists to come, it is not only promotional, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city with the purity of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, the maintenance is lacking.
He spoke of a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of Tourist Graduation, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not give a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, which will need to be put in order first, so that we can make these places more attractive and that we can put them on the list that we have to promote this destination."
IP Asks Congress for Results
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by setting an example in finding better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
Parliamentary periods full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive require the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is struggling with seizures and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 PAN, three by Partido Nueva Alianza, two by PRD, one by PT, one by Convertencia and the last by PVEM, includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they are able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas requiring responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example for better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary crossings to move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do decent work and be primarily committed to society and sectors, because it was Sinaloa's people who gave them their vote in the previous elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to take all the strength to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will promote the creation of jobs in a certain way."
As far as tourism is concerned, he asked that the new legislators give him more weight in the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, which brings value and investment, which also competes directly with agriculture."
In addition to issuing funds for starting tourist projects, Congress should help the state deliver on certainty and assistance with the Alcohol Act, which has not been resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for the Three Kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles are on the children's wish list in the Coronado Valenzuel family, along with other toys.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their fantasies on the coming festival of the Three Kings, since their home includes exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar, and Baltazar will give them toys and clothing that they so long for.
The family lives in a modest home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time, because my husband's not lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... this afternoon I get along with the "knuckles" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten - year - old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight - month - old brother Jesus, Cayetana would have wanted a one - year - long dress.
"He told me (Jose Alfredo) 'I wish this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see son' because it was very expensive', remembering the sadness of Cayetan.
For older children who were just in school, it would be the ideal outfit and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, is a size 12, ten - year - old Isaiah size 10, while eight - year - old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan misses sneakers, so he could really use a pair of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings" and at the reception of Noroeste's journal to bring a gift or money in cash.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 beds of Indian cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment that was used to produce was confiscated" said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Quebec Police.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, both the supposed bosses of this entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
Arrested persons had to arrive at the judicial palace in Sherbrook after their arrest.
They could face charges of manufacturing Indian cannabis, his possession with the aim of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These examinations took place following a long-term investigation which lasted almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public that allowed us to access these arrests" said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional branch of the investigation of the city of Estria of the State Police Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphremagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any difficulty.
The proposal for a Conservative law, which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will clearly be overcome, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I rely to a significant extent on the Charter."
"I stand upright on the side of the party that built granite under your feet," declared the head of liberals Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after a weekly session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that a bill, as proposed, would allow any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill because he was heading towards the wrong end.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will see what the government will do" said M. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough in terms of illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that we should take action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the carrying part of another bill, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year," explained Chow.
Minister for Immigration, Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians together tell the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada's aim and treat it like some kind of lollipop."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not announced a vote on trust in its bill, which could lead the country to vote against it.
In doing so, a conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote to answer every member who opposes his position before his electorate.
New Unity Doesn't Mean Unity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and collegiation, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigation committee for the issue.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, seeks not to forget this idea: Quebec intends to consult the New York Department of Investigation in January next year.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised all of us.
It should be noted that during the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
That was all the need for a public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to rate this announcement as a "bunny pulled out of a hat " and" amateur solution on his knees. "
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the potential future of unity.
"You'll be satisfied with confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of an interrogation of witnesses in a public trial.
"In addition, Mr. Charest is confirming that he does not want to create this committee of inquiry, and people think, like you and I, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only means of achieving the creation of an investigative commission is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Political Science at the Institute for the Education of High Civil Officials.
In order to get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Inspector-General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners who are allowed to force people to testify.
Creating a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of the Chareste administration.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code so that it would be better adapted for this type of crime.
This request would be based on the agent for Operation Marteau (Hammer), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marco Fournier that the caselaw for this type of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected a group of bikers, although the Criminal Code has not yet been modified, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa then had changes made to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several watercourses have been under strict control due to severe rainfall that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a landslide.
Two houses were preemptively evacuated.
In the evening there was another land slide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road's bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit heavy rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 further millimeters was not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were hit the most.
It could fall up to 100 millimeters in total.
If we add up these collisions with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of floods in some watercourses.
The Quebec rescue service issued a warning on Wednesday night against the dangers of flooding for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of flood alert and continuous control.
In the area de Lanaudière caused severe precipitation of the distribution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, as a result of heavy rains, a temporary bridge was torn down.
Two residences had to be preemptively evacuated.
In Outaouais spilling some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Rescue has an emergency and oversees the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, the Security Advisor.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center issued a warning on Wednesday about severe floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially bluffed
Quebec's radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians and, as well as gross expression during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI group 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative statements by Haitians of gross expression that does not correspond to the broadcast during the day."
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the transmission of the name of the two people who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council has received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts transmitted between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Joint Front of Social Support recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts on the air were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most members of the Commission have concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide cannot be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the "Dupont Noon Reports" broadcast have come across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner.'
No complaint was raised against him.
The last dispute was about the statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Réné Dufort were therefore involved in a media shootout that caused many reactions.
CHOI's moderator said he didn't send a gift to help the Haitians because we can't know for sure that they're actually going to get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriate negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already atone for my three-day delay on this thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," said the host.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
Anyway, CHOI-FM's radio broadcasts have collaborated "under their responsibilities."
For a station that will have to report these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuvà Montreal.
The people of Montreal, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, have an extremely special age.
Atlet, which excels in "Sanda" (Kung-fu full contact), in kickboxing and Thai boxing, enters the tatami and rings of the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this person who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS just delivered bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23rd to 30th October, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I've won kickboxing categories full contact and Thai boxing, I said."
"I'm currently preparing for China for the World Cup in San shou."
"They were invited by rivals who finished the first four at the last World Championship in each category."
"In Toronto in 2009, I won the bronze."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007 in China I ended up in the fifth shot tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'll be the first this year or next year at this rate!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches by fists and legs, as well as throwing them to the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, born from this form of struggle, is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Nacer Zemmal is supposed to keep only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" supertournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains the sympathetic guy."
"It's kind of equivalent for Stade Lumpee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first game, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered loss in the finals.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that a single champion, king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without public tenders
Hydro-Québec agreed, by mutual agreement, 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important contract, a contract for managing the entire project in total of $ 295 million without a tender.
This consortium, on behalf of the Energie Gérance, was authorised in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" received a lucrative contract without any tender announcement.
For the Quebec Party, a complaint against a consortium of companies puts before us a serious ethical issue that risks eliminating competition and causes prices to rise.
"It's a new way to realize the collegiate and eliminate the competition."
"This means that people no longer do side agreements secretly, now they do them openly" said yesterday MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says that he is heavily carrying how public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in the afternoon argued that it would be a collusion contract.
"I have my own path," she thundered and claimed, that the PQ was "unrighteous" and "missed accuracy."
She said "it would be the least I could do" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
This is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more undertakings to group their mutual experts so that they can respond to the call for tender for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex given the complexity of the work.
The construction is already underway and has to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being possible; it was trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortiums in the field of consultancy in engineering is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly over the quebec company trade register at a speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortiums, some of which appear to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the Energie consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s."
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to swish the forehead of the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you are going to a tender and if there are few contestants, your prices offered may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, that you will take the people who are participating in the contract and say, "Let's make an agreement satisfactory and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of the people" was confirmed by Mr. Laporte.
This contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir calculated 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil samples analyses.
SNC-Lavalin scored 22 contracts, from which Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in "Energie gérance."
All the contracts have been concluded.
Together, it amounts to $449 783 344, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $229 131 564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good friends of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance" it before she specified that it was more about its managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" etiquette does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer trusts very little the players of sustainable development, but also the "unbiased" brands and environmental certificates, to follow it when choosing products.
The worst part is that even if we bathe in a media universe that urges us and urges us to eat more socially responsiblely, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfil obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, says Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption increased in 2010 with so called socially responsible products, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell them do not believe them very much.
In fact, two thirds of us say that they do not trust the promises of environmental companies, simply because green advertising by companies is finding a measuring tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attributed to such fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands, which are referred to as environmentally responsible, states Barometer.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this subject is accepted as serious only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount for stimulating this consumption page revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers at present.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would lessen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre identified after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the people of Quebecus distrustfully oppose the reported product data or the "green" services we seek to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their customs and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
All 61% of them preferred purchases from traders in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo Consumus Quebec likes to present himself as the recycling king who seeks the least possible impact on the environment by caring for animal protection.
But apparently their social and environmental consciences remained outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec's population reported using mass transportation or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking and bike also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for purchase of the cinema eXcentris complex
The government of Quebec, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema eXcentris complex Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the participation, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle" which sought a gift of $7 million from the Minister of Culture for the purchase of a cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurenta Boulevard and which proved its mission as a lover of film art did not get what it required.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the government proposes a loan to Quebec, the amount of which would be lower, some of which were the original expectations that could build the basis for viable solutions on favourable terms and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and request for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications were already revised for reduction.
The proposal and plan were sent by Minister St-Pierre to the President of the Society for the Development of Enterprise in Culture (SODEC), François Macrola, which manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the government came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation from the State must indeed be rejected.
Recall that the Association of cinema owners and cinematographic centres in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, concluding that the Minister of Culture should not finance a project relating to real estate when he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the debate demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the premises of his cinemas during ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could have been the reason for changing the financial board of the state.
The lack of halls for independent films is loud in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to acquire a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his lead, manages a campaign to mobilise funds into the private sector, in the belief that it will take $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only of three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and project the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't mention Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group thinks of the proposals to reduce what is being done to him.
The curtain raised on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American sources of acquaintance through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferiority to the Americans, but the same blow reveals their sense of superiority against Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian electorate has Canadian-American relations at its heart when it comes to voting, and they believe that President Obama's visit to the conservative government has helped to adopt its 2009 budget!
In addition, four new reports between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday, made public, provide sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The Communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details on what point the United States is not part of the bets that political leaders are discussing.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost stuck, may make political leaders talk about internal betting rather than realizing that the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign) is involved), " she writes.
"The United States is," he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in these elections: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to be spoken of".
The Ambassador understands this "deaf silence" even less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better the party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the preservation of government in the vote on trust at the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget to which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan," says M. Breese.
There was no mention that the government had to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of Parliament so that the coalition could not be defeated and that opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to the increasingly negative picture of the dramatic series broadcast on CBC on the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about the transmission of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where not very subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for the purposes of violent interrogation with the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the case-by-case principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim, state secretary."
"Secretary accepted to revise the file."
Let us finally note that the persons concerned by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on the waves of CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destructed."
Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
World lighting recovery plan
Yesterday, in Cancún, the United Nations proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, business lighting and industrial space in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect reduction (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional constraints that need to be achieved in order to stabilise the planet's climate from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN intends to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-use commitments to reduce on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace heated bulbs that monopolize 50 to 70% of the market with fluocompact bulbs or, even better, light bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a significant amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would be degraded.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the car park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will need to subtract 5 Gt from this balance to achieve climate warming stabilization to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to exclude it from being out of control.
In heated filament lamps 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the light product.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs can last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
The new DEL light bulbs, which Philips introduced this week - this company reportedly participated in a UN study - have an estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of possible savings with a compensation plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and radiate less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, except that manufacturers would set up collections.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compact light bulb, but rather a thermal coal power plant that emits much mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these hubs put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also details the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
Côte d'Ivoire eagerly awaits the results of the election results.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the Presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce its preliminary results without delay, stressing the spokesperson for the President of the United Nations."
"It requests all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from taking any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has let the latest date - Wednesday midnight - pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's crucifixion.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI on TV confirmed that the commission "continues to work" so that it can announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CEI to finally declare the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member of Alassan Ouattara, have increased throughout the world.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on annulment by the Constitutional Council for the "cheating" vote in the north, administered by former insurgents of the New Army (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation by voters who practiced the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have discouraged the supporters of the President of Côte d'Ivoire from going to vote.
Elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
But President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo, is running it.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who dementes any connection with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he suffered loss, and that filing a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from transmitting the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was considered a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country which has been divided into two-half for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the political faction of Côte d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, October 31st, as a winner with 38% votes compared to 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9,3% in metropolitan France (9,7% including overseas areas), as shown by interim data with seasonal variation correction (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed people has settled to 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9,3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9,7% including overseas areas.
In one year, unemployment rates increase by 0.1 points.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of current young people on the labour market has escalated with a new increase in unemployment rates reaching 24,2% in metropolitan France (+ 0,9 points in three months, +0,5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, there were 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
As far as seniors are concerned, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points per three month, as well as per year), i.e. 482 000 people from 50 years up and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 years benefited from unemployment stability at 8,3% in metropolitan France (-0,1 points in three months, +0,1 points in one year) and 8,8% in the whole of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy about its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and announced a rate of 9,8% on Tuesday for France (including DOM) in October after it was 9,9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and remanded into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the chiefs of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Board of Directors Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into public procurement, supposedly subversively acquired.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of misuse of the company's assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, provision of bribes, acceptance of bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists on explaining with the judge all the questions he intends to ask him and not some fantasy."
"It is easy to pursue him for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them", declared for AFP his attorney, Florence Rault, before questioning his client.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew about such a thing, said Mr Simon.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of Aubagne agglomeration services, was charged on Wednesday for the misuse of public funds and a conspiracy, and let loose, under judicial supervision, a ban on associating with the protagonists of the matter.
"My client has been able to explain to him all the facts he's being accused of."
"The investigating judge takes it into account and lets it go free" said his attorney, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and set free on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with the fact that they are under judicial supervision for two of them, said Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadyakian, Deputy Director General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for taking bribes to influence the Office and passive corruption'.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier are charged, one for "theft and misuse of the property of the company," the other for "the conspiracy to abuse public funds."
Finally, Alexander Guérini's business associate, Jeannie Peretti, has been charged with "disclosure of the company's assets."
Among those who have been confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged with the parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were helping to launder money from large-scale gangsters.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular on waste matters.
From a source of close investigation, the search focuses mainly on the conditions for the assignment and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from Marseille City Community (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace exaggerated Syria's mediation
Within more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," united views in France, brought diplomacy to combat alert and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this was closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostages in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how the leaders of France tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian imprisoned in France, and a wanted American justice system for stealthy material trafficking in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they submit to the sharp light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran:French comments on the method of solution in the case of hostages."
Advisor to the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking with the representative of American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that the Americans do just as much to be brought back to their own nationals' homeland by the violence held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "keep saying strongly " in the media the words "the fundamental rights of man," "innocence," "immediate deliverance."
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, must be brought into trouble.
"Do it all the more the more they ask you to stop"
Since there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "the silence will not solve anything, " Iranians are" masters of evasive maneuvers. "
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "the Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail."
It announces that the liberation of Clotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day the French Embassy gives her refuge) "will require the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (EUR 230 000 bail).
And they're going to announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will escalate."
Iranians could "in the future arrest another 1,800 French people living in Iran" he states.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but she remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, about whom the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is asking for this disturbing consensus.
The expansion of Majid Khakavanda is bad news for Washington, who pursues illegal Iranian networks to retrieve material intended for a nuclear program.
France has agreed to negotiate?
Free Iranian for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysian Palace, as it says, was not only "stunned by this judge's decision " but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"Interviews were held between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the decision of the court," notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The counsellor of the Elysian Palace dials a telephone number, hangs a telephone earphone and then informs the American diplomat that Iranian is currently in Paris' buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Clotilda Reiss' imprisonment in Iran, Elysian Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communication and organized "escapes" into the media, to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influential" role as "mediator."
Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that manipulation bears its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "flash" of French officials.
On which such a measure of "gratitude" is based, expressed against M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of eulogy, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons which forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "is heading towards the validation of President Sarkozy's policy of opening up Syria" is being analysed.
The policy applied in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices both in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role, " Paris seeks to "demonstrate Syria, what eulogy it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region. "
The aim is also "to sow a grain of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is."
"But we still thanked them."
"This should at least create confusion and confusion between Iranians."
Clotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it at the Elysian Palace.
In communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrywoman."
End online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Peciválský," which will forbid adolescents to play online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, declared responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to ask online-game companies to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years of age, said representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have learning problems at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the head of the Ministry in charge of the bill, declared to the AFP.
On-line games will be newly accessible from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, specified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents so request, added a responsible worker.
It will also make free programs available to people who so request, enabling them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "disabled" countries, and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, face to face with 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: Fifa appoints host countries.
The Fifa Executive Committee on Thursdays of the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, a selection of sovereignly politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risks overtaking technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Royal Fifa Competition in 2018 will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Belgium, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The Championship in 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to set in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that will take part in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets worldwide.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to determine the hierarchy by candidate.
According to the assessment report, Fifa's documentation in English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments as well as their competitors' documentation.
But these reasons will not be too important for 22 members of the Executive Commission at the time of vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the unveiling, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have ruined the chances of its country, the cradle football, which hosted the world championship only once in a year.
On Monday, the BBC put a crown on it when it broadcasts a document that "punched a pin" by three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fife unhappy and put English leaders in trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move made by his predecessor as Tony Blair, who managed to win the 2012 Olympics organization for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portuguese do not lack trumps of already prepared stadiums, his adventure (World Championship 1982 in Spain, 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliation measures against the English and doubts about Spain and Portugal's solvency only increase Russia's position, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (students, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not be transferred to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" in verbal innuendoes barely perverted in the accusation of the English press against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We'll throw mud at them, try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, they appear to be the logical favorite of the United States with its considerable experience in 1994.
The world's highest economic performance, the headquarters of Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a big lead in Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries, which together underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: granting the World Championship 2026 to China, which is highly wishing for Fifa, has made Asian chances invalid for 2022.
With Qatar, who pulled a large ace out of his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than security.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for poor TV fees (due to a time shift) paid by European countries, creating momentum for Fif.
Second mandate: clarity (security)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand woke up looking like he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
The Elysian Palace's mandate calls for someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously, it's not in good agreement with the sharing of secrets associated with the presidency.
So it must be done as if doubts persisted.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, without wanting to believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends made demands that the third mandate be excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured us that "it would be decided sometime in the autumn of 2011. "
As it reminds the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday night in the Elysian Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" has sown a few feverish states.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the regulation of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's reminded of such meetings in a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he switched in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it is because of the double truth.
Speeding up the path to the PS candidacy, on page one.
But that's not the entrance to Ségolène Royal's collegiate, pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in PS want an arrangement for combat formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," responded immediately and cautiously by people from the nearest neighborhood of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes a possible defeat, he won't run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," repairs Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Council of the year should have been an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European debt pledges, the Institute for Securities Issues will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categoric under the threat of deterioration of the situation now so tense in the European securities markets.
In such a case, the political price would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank to address the crisis of European states' claims.
She didn't mean to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing their sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)."
On the evening before that, in Brussels, in his interrogation of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and he satisfied himself that he stated that the programme for purchasing state titles in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting held this Thursday.
The only certainty: the Central European Bank will monitor its basic unchangeable interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of bonds from the cash register made by the Central European Bank have doubled to almost EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the irish and Portuguese bonds she made new purchases yesterday, thanks to the unreasonableness of the market negotiators.
Overall, central banks have purchased the euro system for €67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts among the negotiators on the anticipation market about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change in the course.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, this latter bank shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of triggering a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely" by Norbert Bräms, the economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions on the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchasing its bonds in order to revive the weak market', adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the burst of paid performance by countries belonging to the most fragile" testified yesterday by a major bond administrator.
Because if interest rates take off, states will worry even more about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It is a rescue of the euro at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi's humpback
After the beginning of the week for Italy worrying, the situation became a little loose, yesterday with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary tranquillity.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs of the regions, they said they heard Giulia Tremonti qualifying the situation as "unsolvable" and expecting a "unpredictable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any event, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points, and the price of contracts against bankruptcy (CDS) went up to 263 points, causing some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that Spain's deviation with German interest was above 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself "too busy " with the" violent development of markets " and possible contagion originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and encryptedly, its problem is the absence of growth and low-level fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
From now on, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1,3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission is calculating the public finance deficit will still represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (against 3.9% of the projected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From there, the reputation for a new summary of the state budget proposals, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounts to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, nor short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119,2% of gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), the efforts to stabilise required in Italy are less than the efforts required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE's chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion to voice distrust to the Chamber of Deputies, and then the elections that will be held at the end of March could begin to be organised.
This would lead to a period of time which is not suitable for taking a decision in a case of serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde stressed it again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think that the Europeans demonstrated this on Sundays throughout the day and night, they are clearly very strong-minded, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, concerning interest on European government bonds, brought water to the mill to governments and Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about starting normalization yet.
The Bureau of Standard & Poor's notation announced that it could degrade the record of Portugal's debt, the targets most targeted by various speculations.
"Because there is a real lack of transparent and obvious policy in May, mainly based on banking systems," says economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so, "political time runs slower than market time."
By knowing this broken context and the danger it is hiding, the European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultation between finance ministers, most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, is developing very well.
This is due to the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin Group from the beginning of next week.
The Central European Bank meeting is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries focusing on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Finance Fund (FEFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, embarked on a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday in order to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
Unless the objective of this trip is to increase funds, it certainly prepares the ground to achieve this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, the US official official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilised funds through additional direct involvement in the FMI.
First of all, Portugal and Spain are preparing for structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that join strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid, a different path than Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, both countries want to avoid asking for international aid even before they apply their own budgetary corrections and before they decide on the structural reforms necessary to regain their lasting trust.
Capital actors in the European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that EUR 750 billion would not be enough mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock of securities again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, an actor of the very first business plan with European sovereign claims, consider that an encore of about EUR 100 billion would be enough, "better" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized to this date by EUR 60 billion.
A Council that has every chance of being tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions got worse.
Snow and ice: 24 regions have an orange emergency.
Snow rations still cause problems in transport, especially on the roads of the second class in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now in an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienna, joined 20 districts, which already have an orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, considerable snow surges cause problems in the north of La Gironde and the forest Charentes and slightly snows on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, some 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and a blanket from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snow surges are large enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, according to Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts banned the passage of heavy goods transport - trucks over 7,5 tonnes with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on the roads of the second class in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and police recommend to drive their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the traffic of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned on Thursday at Picardia.
On Wednesday night, no special measures are foreseen for restrictions on freight transport.
The district office "calls all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt the road to the nature of the road'.
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy Airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% at Orly due to expected snow surges.
DGAC recommends connecting passengers using air transport services with their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airports in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
It has been raining billions since the debate on modernization of Ile-de-France.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of the 23 billion Grand Paris metro station, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be started, the State announced a subsidy of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, it is an amount which allows SGP to use part of the financing from its dual source for contracts.
Today we are finally getting to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Act, which is being examined by the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
First, we read in the text of the draft law, Article 15, "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris'.
It is calculated: "The revenue from this interest is EUR 117 million per year'.
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for offices that already exists "to be modernised, to increase the yield obtained from it and to affect the increase to Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would that cost?
A mirage.
This is not calculated in the text.
We're a long way from $4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion from a capital subsidy that will be mobilised by the State and transferred to the Société du Grand Paris project" we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We at SGP do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we created income (both taxes, noodles), we can cover the studies for three years and then go to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as necessary'.
SGP considers that 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 promised billions still belong to absent bankers, risks causing a rather busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be December 7th.
Vengeful hackers and vengeful spies
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and anticipates the future controlled by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation that every document compiled by the secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of printing cuts.
The "special revelation" of Americans about the way Berlusconi's sexual life has been announced by what everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all except these two Berlusconi owns), and the infamous cartoon profile of Gaddafi has long been a theme for cabaret artists for sketches.
The rule that secret documents may only consist of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work is repeated (by Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Zednáři) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to look for new information (he does not even know where to look for reports of non-existent ones), but because those who are engaged in the occult believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and a lazy (or limited spirit) head of secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be an editor in the Libération newspaper) who considers it true only what he admits.
The high-security information on Berlusconi that the US Embassy sent to the State Department was the same that Newsweek published the week before.
So why has there been so much fuss about exposing these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can make phone calls or fly off on a plane for a joint dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into a spy center.
Any viewer watching movies about an investigation knows very well that it seems to be ignored only by flattery.
However, the fact that it repeats itself publicly denies the obligation of hypocrisy and sheds bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information from the most powerful country in the world represents a hard blow, not a small one, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victim and his executor.
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to hold all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since he was able to control every move through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, became a citizen of a complete sacrifice to the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even "the tombs" with the most secret information powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a avenger of a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can power be maintained that no longer has the chance to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is an uninhibited secret (and the uninhibited secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, meaning that it is removed from public life; but to reveal, just as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were meaningless secrets, means to remove all power from it.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something to big Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this blow be so significant?
Clearly, in the future, countries will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equivalent to publishing it on a poster posted on the corner of the street.
But it is also quite clear that with current technologies, it is pointless to hope that you can keep the message secret over the phone.
There's nothing easier than finding out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of her colleagues.
How will private and sensitive reports be kept secret in the future?
I know that for the moment my prognosis belongs in science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who carry themselves discreetly carrying formalities on uncontrollable routes and carrying only those messages that are memorized or rather concealing rare information in the heel of a shoe.
Information will be preserved in unique copies in sockets closed by key: overall, the attempt to espionage in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, which means backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a wire-based telegraph (telephone).
Videotapes (analog) enabled cinema lovers to take the movie step by step, move it forward and backward and uncover all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CD (digital) only allow them to jump on chapters, that is, macroporce.
Through the fast trains we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
So it is not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn vehicles.
One final point.
Other times, the press tried to understand what was planned in the embassy's secret.
Now they're embassies asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to keep promises for quickly unblocked funding (spoken funding with a fast start) or premature), implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks have been exposed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries undertook to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU pulled a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report specifying the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations invaluable and valued at their true value: advanced countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them equally and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which brings it on the right track to keep its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional' under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to Public Aid for Development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for three years of funding fast start.
Other countries have selected similar references with annual payment deadlines or with public aid deadlines for development.
By contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects' in 2010 is "new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for the Development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the overall amount of support from France towards developing countries may remain constant (or even decrease) to comply with its commitment to financing "new and additional'....
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ borrowed equals 1€ donated.
Clearly, it is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it on the basis of our commitments but as the loan price for a creditor country (i.e. the interest rate equivalent).
But France can only give such a justification: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million, making it 91.5 percent loan (EUR 389,8 million) and 8,5% donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify it for yourself.
It is the only country of the Union using a loan on such a scale.
Germany requested 46% of this, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including others) comply with their 100% donation obligations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union gives € 1 in the course of its promise, France will only give 10 cents and consider this effort comparable.
Beautiful trickery!
For the sake of summary, when financing "fast start" France operates with double cheating: on the one hand, with the development of the share in time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it only issues EUR 36.1 million, it can convince it that it spends EUR 420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that, although Bercy was the one who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when they just need to borrow?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The early funding chapter is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in an enormous machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and politeness and justice towards other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France should avoid discussing deposits in long-term funding (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the issue of 'additionality' or the way in which loans are booked.
France should change its position in order to become so progressive with these deposits as with others.
So everyone puts hope in the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that children eat.
A 10-year-old will one day consume 81 different chemicals, according to one study published on this Wednesday, from the association of Future Generations (ex-the Movement for the Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The Association notes that its results "have no significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed issue" bought food commonly consumed in four meals between July and September and one light meal as a light snack for one child of about ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sweets, were analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to glands with internal excretion (PE), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individually accepted chemical are not exceeded, in our research we can well see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking," the Association states.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk contain in themselves about ten résiduas with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including in France a prohibited fungicide agent.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which were included in lunch, where studies discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steaks, canned tuna, and even bagels and chewing gum were spiked with pesticides and other chemicals.
In water from the tap analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "continent cocktail" is likely to be underestimated', as shown in the study.
The Environmental Europe-Greening Association (EE-LV) proposed "to face an urgent situation" to set up a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilization diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the presence status of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
