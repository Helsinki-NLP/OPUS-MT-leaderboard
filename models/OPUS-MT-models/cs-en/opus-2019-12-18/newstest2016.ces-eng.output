In an emergency call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend.
During the call to the emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and needed them to come to their house.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset, and that contacts with the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police, Amy Prentiss found the body and a manually written message on white paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," said a letter signed by Lamb, according to the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to a school campus where the police believe he shot the favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university employees heard shooting at 10:18 a.m.
I heard Lamb made a fatal phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after shooting at school, he forced the students and the faculty to hide behind a locked door, still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
Details published by investigators on the state side, students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Gautier PD, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included Lambo in the book he wrote in thanking "great people " with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with 17 other faculty members, and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there have been inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed agitated and shaken "like something was wrong with him. "
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for medical reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
The president of William LaForge University said that he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr Lamba seemed to have been troubled. "
Lamb won't answer those questions anymore.
After he left campus, the police picked up his trail as he crossed the border of Arkansas State back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gun shot in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of Washington State, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began to work at a university which has 3500 students in the city, accounting for about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
In the spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny person.
Carla Hairston reported that she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was in high school with her friends, and he was the great older guy who tutored her guitar for years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The hearts of all the girls were lifted as soon as they appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be dating for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there never was a record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when she and Abigail were evacuated at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a savings-lit bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, the sweat that Lamb played on the guitar and harmonica for a countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything bad.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We've been fooling each other and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a killed professor, conducted a first-year seminar and specialized in American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students and community members, attended a candlelight event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil during which the university corps served "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported to Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
The Toys R Us claim not to recruit as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children's toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, which is a decrease compared to 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit employees during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is coming up and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to assist in shops and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his date with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was remarkable even for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would sit there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in time."
The movie's starting, and I realize I'm within reach of something you might call a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a documentary on "Back to the Future," which presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "It is indeed the best travel document ever filmed for me. "
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons will only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
Once again, the UN Chief has urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unify and promote inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at Wednesday's press conference that he was planning to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent country councils - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly ministerial meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "made this situation unsolvable. "
Ban has called for five permanent members to show solidarity and unity that they have shown in achieving Iran's nuclear resolution agreement in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to describe him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others were waving their hands like a bad joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what it means for the nomination chances of this real estate tycoon.
Of course, it is still the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made way for Herman Caine to rise, and in the end neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might encounter the general election.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and are starting to interpret their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real estate tycoon is not just a passing phase:
Trump's approval rating turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick in the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said that they would be "enraged " by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent said they would be "excited" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters claim that they would be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush's favorite were to become a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his pompousness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationwide inclined to the idea that a real estate magnate has the right temper for the presidency, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post vote.
The same number is held at the Iowa State Senator's Club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say that his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to CNN/ORC survey from last week.
That's the change from late July when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the 28 percent nomination for the eventual Mitt Romney nomination.
Yet it turns out that a number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that a fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump's support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct duel between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a businessman with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
The bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made their point.
A new Tuesday's CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of Trump-supported voters say they won't change their mind.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can actually say that they would never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for a change among candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion as final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violentists" in his campaign's announcement speech, immigration still holds as the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump's pompousness will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and damage to the efforts to rebrand.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote Monday say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
Des Moines Register/Bloomberg's vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent are" hellishly angry."
The House supported a larger proportion of the State's coal charges.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported a government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the levy on the surface extraction of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised the Members that they would receive extra money from both the Treasury and municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized by opponents who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House at first reading supported a government amendment to the Mining Act, which means, among other things, that the State should receive a large part of the proceeds from the mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the municipality's share will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for minerals which the companies produce.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of the municipalities' budgets is to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
From brown coal mining, the municipalities went about CZK 200 million and the state CZK 66 million.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration from the mining areas with permitted mining to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments should continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities would receive CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million each year instead of CZK 14 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but it will be determined by the government's regulation.
The remuneration shall be newly calculated as the product of the quantity of minerals harvested and the rate for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by a government order might not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax because the state charges a mineral which is state property.
Only municipalities whose territory is affected by mining shall receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the community's money and one-quarter the state will receive.
The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive rock extraction.
The part of the money collected by the State on mining fees will be assigned.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mining rescue service.
The draft was criticised by opposition MEPs who claimed, in particular, that they would harm communities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have been, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
A KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned about the increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully suggested rejecting the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for work.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are over 90 percent long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heat plants should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating costs, which would in particular mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to the Commission, the increase in employment fees is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur on Milan Urban's amendment (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before passing the law.
If coal goes beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the revenues for both the state and the municipalities, emphasized.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until after 2020.
The limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for reasons of social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Merry will lead the Czechs as a leader, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board at the Davis Cup Ballet in India on Thursday, and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to dismantle the load on the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
There is a hot and high humidity in Delhi, which is why challenging matches are expected, which can stretch through up to five hundred.
We have to take this into account.
I'd like to spread it out by the weather.
And according to how it will look, he said Navrátil during today's Czech selection practice in the center of Raja Kumar Khanna.
Jiří Veselý counts on Friday and Sunday doubles with the 1st team and the world's 40th.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are probably turning into position 2.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
It's a little slow in my head, but I'm not gonna say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be Štěpánk's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who's gonna stand next to an experienced asshole who's got a balance of 18-4 in Davis's Cup.
I don't think it's gonna be funny.
There are options left with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know who and what it's gonna look like," he said.
It will be decided according to the development of doubles.
Pavlasek can be the variant, with Veselý surprised in the first round winning in the debula above Australians.
"He's polite to the debacle," said Navrátil.
I did it against Australia, and if I'm gonna play, I'd like to perform the same performance I've shown since the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The landlord puts Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ranking), who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he beat players third and fourth hundred rankings.
The second will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers, and our guys have ATP Tour experience, but we've convinced ourselves a lot of times that the charts in Davis' cup don't make decisions.
"The current form of weather is decided," said Navrátil.
Friday's opening doubles start at 6:30 P.M. and they can stretch out due to the weather.
It's supposed to rain and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it may be played in artificial lighting.
They've already lit it, and it's got some 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be able to be played under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will be debuting at Prime Minister's Questions
Mr Corbyn's debut in PMQ has been very enthusiasticly awaited since his election.
Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and he will be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In his weekly statement, he asked for "less theatre and more facts. "
He also said that he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual Tuc Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem's singing on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and is the focus of several stories on the headlines of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention to himself
Mr. Corbyne's spokesman said that he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would acknowledge "the heroics of the royal air force in the battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would recommend the Labour Leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "guarded" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyl said at the Tuc conference that the Workers' Party submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit of benefits.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontational and will refrain from both "quick responses" and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at the PMQ if he does not participate - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he let himself be heard that he had discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House, John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said that he wanted to deviate from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with the PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House, and their position among other MPs, although critics argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Shooting in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a hard place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising while wage growth in the UK is accelerating
The pound jumped in the following dates and showed the UK wage growth recovery, while FTSE 100 was driven up by SABMiller's bidding target.
Between May and June, GB's profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if estimates were approaching when rates would rise.
Sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed to 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped 20% after he received an offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two of the world's largest breweries, and approach brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from Richemont's rival group of luxury goods.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
The shares in Glenncore increased by 5% after the mining giant said that they increased by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The shares in the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest drop on the index and dropped by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating to the company's "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jump in mid-year profits before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive Chairman JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, states.
Costs could hit plans to expand JD Sports, added, which could mean less new jobs.
Opponents of Prague's apartments cheer the marshmallow.
Controversial construction got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision unlawful and will appeal against it.
There were 1 hundred people protesting the construction, which is to be created in close proximity to the Anež monastery in the center of Prague, and petitions were also made before the Prague office.
The Magistrate stated in the decision that there had been a breach of the construction law because all the elements of the territorial decision had not been complied with.
"The relevant territorial decision does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and intelligibly described shape of the building, the definition of the territory concerned by the impact of the construction," his decision states.
It also considers that certain documents for the decision have been issued for the original documents which have changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be created on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file material that the owner of the land only demonstrated consent to the project documentation for the zoning process, not to the location of the building on its land, writes the department of the construction order.
According to Francesco August Razett of the investor company, the construction department did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review had expired.
Anyway, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, following all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call a marshmallow due to the supposedly proposed facade color, creates strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
The association and residents of nearby houses resent that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the unsuitability of buildings for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anež monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original design of the 2008 project, which envisaged the glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monument Institute (NÚ) and cancelled the permit of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by both the SAO and the City Monumentists and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the objections of opponents, he said he never counted on the facade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname after pink and white sugar.
The Czech politician gave migrants a lift.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring relief aid to refugees.
On his way along with the crew, he took three Syrian refugees to his car, who were supposedly about a half a mile away.
According to him, it was not a crime in Hungary at the time, he claimed to the People's Newspaper.
We knew that law enforcement didn't affect such behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and took us into custody in Szeged, he described the letter.
Finally, a politician spent nine hours in his cell.
The police said that they behaved correctly, but they didn't know how to communicate, because they didn't speak English very well.
The prison, however, seemed to be ruthless.
For example, in our cell, about three times four metres in size, 15 refugees from Syria were in distress.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked in there the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What can't be confiscated?
Ask the President of the Executor Chamber.
On Friday 18.9., from 9:30 p.m., President of the Executor Chamber of the Czech Republic, Mr. Pavla Fučíková will answer questions from readers.
You can ask her about changes to the Enforcement Act valid from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or executioners.
Metrash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi's invasion
Metcast is trying to protect his IGA business from Aldi's attack in southern and Western Australia.
Metrash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi's invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brand by marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added to brands such as Dunsborough based Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings in IGA stores and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australia's football league to local customers.
Metrash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29th, when the food, alcohol and hardware seller celebrates his annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because South and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metlash IGA's trade steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metlash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the retail IGA could lose $360 million on annual sales and the Metcast $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in southern Australia and 30 in Western during the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million on individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a fixed price base of Metcast could cost him around USD 13 million on pre-tax returns, confirmed by Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcast loses its share of market share in the eastern states, mainly towards Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that buyers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that the sale of Metrash food will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglass fund, founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcast refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comment.
But it's known that a member of the Metcast board contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and the profits from the food trade of Metrash , which supplies about 1200 retail IGA , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation since sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale went into counterattack and invests more than 150 million USD a year to match counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, helping retail IGA re-equip shops by adding fast-growing food and news from private owners.
Metrash Executive Director, Ian Morrice, claims that pricing and business adjustment programs will catch up and hope that the grand sale will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become collateral damage in recent fuss around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, reports President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka on Montreal Masters.
Soon after that, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then said: "Wawrinka had one to hit Kyrgios and I should have hit him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after his spasm ruined the possible defeat of Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis continued to defend Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a position in the second two-game behind Bernard Romanic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I have been thinking quite intensively about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the entire dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed a rocket when he lost because of a cramp in the US, but he's not the first player to take out anger on his own rocket because of frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he really handled himself very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's also got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits into the team great and so on, never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the locker room, he's trained hard, he's in amazing shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported Kyrgios' decision to overlook the important match that starts on Friday, stating that "a mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but he supports a native from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term stable.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that [Kyrgios] has created around it," Healy says.
And I think that Nick was rising very quickly, as Federer, Murray and others point out, in the public's eyes he is growing rapidly, he has also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he is getting, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and for some time outside the sun, when he will be able to think about it, is in my opinion the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency status, closes borders and holds migrants
Following the announcement of the threat situation, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and apprehended those who attempted to cross it illegally in order to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in no one's country, and Serbian authorities reacted outragedly.
Those who are stuck at an unknown time on the belt of the earth between two states stand those who flee from violence in their native lands, building tents and settling in.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, migrants together call out "Open the border!" and call out to the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just indirect harm.
During the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The riots on the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-state bloc did not come up with a unified immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an agreement for another month or the end of a year, which would be accepted by EU nations by more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU European summit on Tuesday another week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's threat situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up asylum lawsuits.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News korepondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped draw barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point for the European Union for Refugees, many of which have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize the violation of the four-metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer time limits in prison for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," Zoltan Kovacs, spokesperson for the government in Szeged, South, told reporters.
In this we are very clear: illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must still approve the deployment of the army that was expected next week, but reporters Associated Press on the border have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an advisor to Orban's home defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 caught already on the territory of the state.
They penetrated through fence damage and are now being charged in police custody with committing offences under new laws.
Authorities quickly had the fence fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tractor covered with barbed wire.
The main border crossing near Roszke created chaos because Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and crowded people.
About 20 fit in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's jump before Bernie Sanders fell by half in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead in the Democratic National nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her lead.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of democratic primary voters (a drop of 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (a rise of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is getting support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say that it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions that the candidate will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost her ground to several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton keeps a big head start between women and she's slowing down, but her leadership is narrowing down.
Her support among men has decreased significantly and Sanders loses only 5 points on her.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 has vanished and are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to the older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead on Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is losing only five points in this group.
About half of democratic primary voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations, and a further 15 percent would only support her for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I guess it's no surprise that Clinton's current followers are particularly passionate about her.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), followed by the time to be president of a woman (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, there is a great opportunity to choose and agree on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of democratic primary voters would wish to face it - a third thinks he should not run.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who would be chosen as the second choice for the nomination of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, she has listed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden is running for office, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be chosen is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer resolution of problems to greater chances of election.
Like last month, neither democratic candidate or potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have that opinion on him.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological outlook.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as a state secretary continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of her has not affected her at all.
But it's a whole different story between the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third of them are satisfied.
The public's views on the subject were already divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have deteriorated their view of Clinton.
It is mainly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived to be honest and trustworthy among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as being honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush did their best in honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't take an opinion on him.
The error margin for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up with Donald Trump in the national election.
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey.
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest survey and others are getting support.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump by overwhelming majority, and climbed out of 23% of the support in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well across demographic groups and eliminated Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and the governor of Ohio, John Kasich, is behind the Swiss governor Scott Walker completely on the floor of 10% of the aid fell to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of support among Republicans for Trump's 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
At Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to fire a blind shot at a retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump during the campaign in Iowa last Saturday.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during the overloading brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Brotherhood of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, reported the police.
Police officers say that he was blindfolded, carrying a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the goal through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache and then passed out.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 immediately after Deng passed out and reportedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, says the police.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris Vagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their equipment and basically preferred the well-being of brotherhood to the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeated by blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overburdening in fraternity and at least one student dies every year because of overloading since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be responsible, and this step is important from the institutions.
The grand jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with assault by overburdening and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only those involved, but if there is an organization that approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will also hold them responsible," said Wagner at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and the national brotherhood abolished its relationship with local branches.
This is the tent when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate growth will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it's gonna take and how long it's gonna take.
For the economy in particular, history offers a small source of timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have highlighted so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rates will start to rise, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are indeed more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss about speed increases can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, the leading global economist of Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more common but increasingly low will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last month or so, the expected increase in rates can make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for the stock re-leaving after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts reported in a recent study about what will happen after the Fed increase.
More precisely, the market for the past 35 years is often the most - about 14 percent - heading towards an increase in rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase 2.6 percent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to Bob Doll's recent analysis, the main stock strategist of Nuveen Asset Management published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the tariff cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but higher rates often help it.
At present, the Fed faces some conditions that have not yet existed and which could hasten recession.
The most remarkable is that gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history when increasing Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 increases in rates since 1950, only two nominal annual GDP increases were below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates in this complex economic background could be risky, and there might be a question of "when this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready to grow the Fed all year round and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, future trading indicates only 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the increasing cycles have so far been in the super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this has clearly been a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those the Feds have waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now 74 months and we are still going on.
The firm yield was also volatile because the market expects a rate increase and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in shares when the Fed changes the policy direction.
In the case of bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately," said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that an increase in rates will bring the revenue closer between long- and short-listed bonds to equal the curve.
High yield bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful to strain yield," Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spread has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that carry out most of their business in the US win after the interest rate rises and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will fare worse, because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that "quality" of shares tends to overcome itself within three months after the initial increase in rates," reported Goldman Sachsve analysts in the client report.
Firms with strong balance sheets surpassed weak balance-sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, also exceeded their lower quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (per cent points respectively).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates lose the most, said Goldman.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers also benefit from the growing dollar.
Savings can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims Mr Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "stupefying"
He takes the view that he's getting more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
A fellow MP Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says neither is he an original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" in Classic FM, claims a leading Member and is piling up fresh pressure to broadcast to prove that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts do not do.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's bosses that the public service radio station seems to be "stupid" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word "stupid" - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Mr.Bingham said.
The Director General of the BBC rejected the accusation on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to music and making music is actually top-notch.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into service is very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year BBC regulator Radia 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire due to stepping on the heels of business competitors during the broadcasting of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talp Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shined as judges - was produced "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when it starts a fun series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of more future series of The Voice or the spending of taxpayers' fees on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grow at the slowest pace since August and the blame may be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since the year 2000 the records began.
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could be the reason for braking spending
More than a decade was virtual shopping on the rise and thanks to it, many British main streets became a ghost town.
However, experts claim that there are signs of steady-state online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the very beginnings of the 2000 measurements, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of steady-state online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past years and go back to 2000, the state has always rationalized over time," says the IMRG sales index editor Guardian Andy Mulcahy.
It explains that Internet sales were reinforced three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to be wearing off.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from buying before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to arrange shopping and knock down several vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers again negotiate, can hold customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
The Muslims buried the victims of a crane crash in Mecca, and the Bin Laden family was sanctioned.
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets of Muslims during the performance of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the construction tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of a crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims down the street.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, mourners chose their way and paid their respects to the victims when the first of the fallen got on their last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
A sad message passed past the holy place, where only a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell upon the believers.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned the building group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies 29 dead after the fall of the crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of the four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual haj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already promised that Hadj to Mecca will be held and thousands of people will continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane's shoulder up when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the Order, carried by the State operated by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English services of the disc agency did not report this detail, but they said that the company's bosses were forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims overge before the Hadž pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any declaration of crane collapse and were not provided by its commentary representatives.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with weather officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive building effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and they've been running major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash took place in the midst of a strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every competent Muslim must attend at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyales (£ 174.000) will be dedicated to relatives killed, and the same amount for permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
Chief B&Q claims that Eastern European businessmen working for cheap are no longer trending
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, claims Veronique Laury
The number of Eastern European businessmen taught is behind the growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix shop focused on traders
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
He processed Rupert Steiner, the lead correspondent for the Daily Mail
They say the British are putting down hammers and brushes and handing them over to trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their homes.
If you're good with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do handicrafts at their home, according to the head of the company for the Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns a home-use chain, claims that a large increase in the number of Eastern European businessmen offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores focused on businessmen and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Laury claims she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halfs.
At present, the majority of male workers are.
She said that there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more women's households making more household adjustments than in the past.
Laury says: "Most men still work in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of decisions about purchases of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence between the director of men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that he has half the representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial director.
Laury argues: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women we'd take to our place.
Kingfisher announced a decline in both profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the cost of closing shops.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in danger.
"It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
Mr Zbyněk Stanjura, President of the ODS, noted that a one-time contribution sounds good, but it would be better to be in standard valorisation in the long term because it would have been reflected in other years.
"We have room to find the mechanism to arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), according to which next year was to be approved above the law.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she does not think is pink.
According to her, higher valorisation next year would mean the budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorization had been reduced.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The veto of the right will make the payment significantly more difficult in December and maybe even make it impossible, he said.
The President of ČSSD Members Roman Sklenák therefore proposed a reduction of the deadline for discussing the standard in committee to 10 or 20 days, even the right blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should total the state to CZK 1.73 billion.
The money should go mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should increase by about a hundred crowns on average.
According to the pension amendment, people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December should receive the allowance.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension right before its payment in December.
However, they would have to apply in writing for an extra fee by the end of next year at the latest.
The pensions in the Czech Republic are reviewed regularly as of January, by rising prices and by a third of the growth of real wages.
This year the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Old-age pension expenditure accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10.714.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has left his plans for a political career, he will be engaged in science.
The Senate chair was almost certain by the Russian media.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate for the Government Party of the United Russia, defended his post in the Sunday elections with an overview.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by a governor from three candidates whose names are announced before the governor's election.
After the election, the Senator of the three candidates will choose himself.
The complication for Jakunin was the fact that he hasn't lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by the law.
The Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin with the fact that he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The filming of the Czech comedy Tiger Theory is finished.
The final drop in the main hero's purpose is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who ran out of strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurová decided about Grandpa's life, age, and funeral.
John knows that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzer are on a similar journey.
He will remember that he once had his own will and dreams, wanting to live again with dignity and freedom.
He longs to regain control of his life - and he chooses to escape from his former life as a solution, he told the story of Nightingale.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning it was clear that Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the Invisible series, will play the lead role.
Yet he was said to be surprised by an actor who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break associated with the recovery of a serious disease.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a cocooned athlete.
He used to ask where he'd sit before shooting the next scene.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks and even went uphill.
And all in record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, women are marrying a tiger to turn him into a rabbit over time.
They're gonna give him some feed, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't accidentally think of playing tiger outside the rabbit room.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented on it.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative figure.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathic, and she means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurper and wants to nurse her husband to death, said Bajgar.
Janová's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the sons-in-laws Erik and Pepiek - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohak also present the film in parallel.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US Internet company Google has promised to provide more than $5.5 million (CZK 132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday Google.org, which is a charity branch of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled part of Telička's visit for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the ANO movement Pavel Telička postponed the upcoming Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this by the EP resolution last week, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and whose Telička was a co-author.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party Telička lost the possibility of interviews with official partners and also a visit to political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, explained in a press statement his Brussels office.
Telička wanted to use the route that was planned several months in advance to meet with the management of Parliament and executive representatives as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent by the Czech News Agency was specified.
The EP resolution condemns the 'unseen repression of civil society in Azerbaijan'.
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment on Azerbaijan's opposition journalist Chadija Ismail, who advocated the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not exclude the Russian air base in Syria.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing is ruled out, he said.
Russia already has an old naval base in the port of Tartus, which has so far been used as a service and logistics centre.
According to Russian press reports, since the beginning of August, Russian weapons and military supplies have increased to Syria.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base near Latakiya, which remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria; American commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov, it was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to convey concern about the assembly of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House spokesperson, Josh Earnest, called Asad's support from Moscow a lost bet.
He said about Russia's policy objectives in Syria that they were rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has turned Syria into its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, it is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria today, according to Russian press speculation, is to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, Russia's leader is not going to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to today's New York Times report, the US government does not rule out President Barack Obama meeting with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
But the White House advisors say they're still breaking up.
Today, TASS, referring to the words of Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskova, wrote that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the program of his New York stay.
Use sesame oil for a gallbladder diet, cannabis helps strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
All healthy substances remain in oil when pressing from cold seeds.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, such as gallbladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common reason for the death of Czechs for several years.
It's mostly women who are suffering from gingerbread inflammation, which helps sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used on a gallbladder diet.
Essential fatty acids that it contains are good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
Generally, the problems with gallbladder mainly concern overweight people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be used successfully in a liver diet that is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that brings consumption of this oil, they should beware of the goods from exotic food stores.
Asian producers often use pruned seeds that have a stronger taste for pressing.
The oil thus loses all active substances, described by Ladislav Hačecký, Executive Director from Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in Sokolov, which produces bio virgin oils pressed cold.
The company also manufactures sesame oil and uses exclusively unfried white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can press 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for marking extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives on heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerska's research at Masaryk University revealed that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it is already starting to burn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, for seasoning salads and is particularly useful in dieting, in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids most reduce cholesterol levels.
When having problems with the heart, you should be careful about the amount of total fat and calories received.
For example, there are 62 calories in a spoonful of sunflower oil, 99 calories in a spoonful of rape oil.
As far as the energy value of food is concerned, it is important to realise that natural foods with nutritious substances are much more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as much as sesame and hemp for nine months.
Storage in the fridge will prolong the durability.
Old oil is known especially by bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no cataract at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Cannabis oil contains the most healthy acids.
Since the seeds of technical cannabis are called superfoods, cannabis oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids can't make their own body, and one has to take them from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of scientists published in the European Clinical Nutrition Journal has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece will consume 0.6 grams, but the Icelandics will accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Cannabis oil should be included in the diet as part of a support diet to strengthen immunity and to heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People need not fear the use of cannabis oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
It's sold 500 grand a year.
People often use one spoon in the morning.
Cannabis oil is not tastefully distinctive, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vlček of the beautiful Bohemia Oil company.
According to statistics, Americans are the most passionate nation of barbecuers.
There's 1.4 grills per household.
Around the world there are various barbecue competitions that only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have not grilled in their lives.
The vast majority barbecues several times a year.
To ensure that the barbecue is successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - ideal to adjust the meat by marinating several hours before the heat treatment.
What oil is best suited to this and also leaves healthy ingredients for barbecue?
Generally, it should be saved with fat when grilling processes themselves.
Experts agree that much of the oil starts to lose its taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oil doesn't find its way through the barbecue.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When it is said meat, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in Sokolov will immediately recall grape oil.
It complements the taste of meat and fish wonderfully.
The kitchen features a unique characteristic of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and barbecue because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Oil, one of the few Czech producers of this vine oil, describes the benefits of grape oil from Bohemia Oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our outer beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acne and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs appreciate the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for preparing cold dishes, for example for seasoning salads, but also for heat treatment of dishes.
There are two ways to use barbecue, marinating and barbecue.
By marinating meat and fish, we will preserve their juicyness.
Three ingredients must be present in the marinade preparation: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we will supply acidity with apple vinegar to help soften the meat.
The spice, in turn, gives the meat taste and oil to preserve and deliver the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
It also adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it can pass through dark meat as one of the few oils.
Marinated meat or fish are ready for barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare meals.
Same goes for barbecue.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This concerns, in particular, flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling yourself, rub the grate with oil to prevent the burning of food.
Preparation of attachments is also an essential part of barbecue.
The grilled meat and fish are suitable for practically anything - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, hot summer salad.
For it you need: • 1 pc of peaches • 1 bundle of arugula • 1 cup of cut cucumber • 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add pickled rucola, diced cucumber and large dice to the mixture of salad leaves.
Based on the taste of salt and pepper, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drip a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: not only the medications, but also the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example women with multiple sclerosis need consultation, if they decide to have a child, social counseling, recommendations for housing etc. are included in the care of these patients.
Yet all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and may not change the way he lives.
As doctors point out, the passivity of patients releases space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is shown that regular movement delays the time when a sick person needs a compensatory aid, such as a stick.
The important thing is that patients and their surroundings do not subject to various myths, such as that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That's why the website was created.Give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by an ongoing media campaign.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis it is true twice the saying that the disease begins to treat earlier, the more likely the doctor can influence something.
It is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis at an inflammatory stage when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the more hope is that we can stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important in people with multiple sclerosis, which most often solves weakening of the lower limbs or disturbances of balance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen pelvic floor, reduce swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific problems," says Dr. Martin Kövári, chief of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but they all show up in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the body's immune status, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive feature of regular exercise is the fact that the sick verify what they can do, and this strengthens their confidence.
"Endorphins are also washed up during the exercises and one feels good about it," says Dr. Kamila Řasová from the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic of the Royal Vinohrady Faculty Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We interfere directly with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
"Earlier, these patients were saved, we know today that they need a targeted burden," says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
The aim of physiotherapy is to keep a person self-sufficient as long as possible, including a job assignment.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with ergotherapists so that each person gets a compensatory aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a tough life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people shake it up.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they eventually conclude that even with the handicap can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the airbuses would not fly.
Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that somebody can't produce and process.
Yet, next to super-precision computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for the formation of composites, you can encounter something as ordinary as apricot stone.
In a drum that resembles a cotton pot, the edges of the metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are being rolled into a pile of rocks.
"No one has come up with anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of Latecoere Air Door Manufacturer Czech Republic.
In the complex in Prague Letňany, the former Letov produces a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world, they deliver doors for Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, also enter first and higher class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airbus A380.
There's also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy here is the main motto.
Maybe the moment keys are being set twice a year by the company.
If the yellow label lacks a check-up record, they would have something to explain to the auditors of Airbus or Boeing in Prague, who regularly drive to see if the door is produced according to agreed rules.
Human senses have not completely replaced advanced technology yet.
There's 1500 rivets on one door to A320.
You have to hand-shake the riveters.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer falling, they'll know if the rivet is shaky enough.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet may rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0,13 millimeters.
That's roughly twice the thickness of human hair.
When the check comes to a trained touch.
When a controller runs his finger over a number of rivets, he knows if any of them are out of tolerance.
Then he'll pick up the exact weirdometer.
Before 1989, Letov fed the program of training military aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, neither of them were made anymore.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
That's when she hooked up with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the emergency door supplier for model A321.
Courtship with Boeing wasn't so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and for Boeing to guarantee long-term stable deliveries," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained locked if the Latecoere Group had not delivered a French group at the Prague conference in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day began negotiations with the French, says Dubský.
A year later Latecoere bought Czech company and with strong company came new orders.
The assembly of parts of the door for A320 started right in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck doors were added for the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for delivery for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we'd do parts or small parts.
Partners want guarantees of delivery for 20 or 30 years, explains Dubský.
Last year Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over 2,9 billion and profit after tax 147 million crowns.
Exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certification and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't have made any aircraft doors.
To obtain certificates that the production processes meet the customer's requirements, and in repeated checks to keep them worth millions of crowns according to Dubský.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and more stringent.
We need to train employees, re-equip equipment and re-certification the whole process, adds Dubský.
Now the company is finishing the preparation of the zinc-plating process and nickel-plating process, which will replace the previous harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the specifications from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people from Boeing are coming to check out the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, zooms in the Dubsky way the customers control them.
The reward is the Prague company's long-term exclusive contracts.
Today, the production of embraers is standing and falling with the Prague race.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of doors.
Replace Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for Brazilian or European producers.
But it doesn't mean he could say any price behind the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It indicates how many doors one door will cost in ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
Price per piece keeps dropping to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we'll lose, says Dubsky.
Half the hall, where electrical cabinets are assembled for Airbus A400 M, is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen there is a new semi-robot line for riveting and mounting doors for the innovative A320 Neo model.
Riveting will accelerate and refine.
"This is the trend in aviation installation," Dubský adds.
Departure has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 units of the new A320 model.
Just a few meters away, there will be a line for complete installation of the doors for the A380 top deck.
It's our parent company's strategic decision.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company has to pass qualification tests, for example for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský says.
Latecoere, however, gets to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place on the premises of Letov.
Before the French mother's entry, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's got 800, and there could be a hundred more in three years.
As long as Airbus and Boeing overtake how many hundreds of new aircraft are ordered by airlines each year, they need not worry about work.
Despite having contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money for September's loan payments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she traded some of their loans for shares.
Creditors gained a €37.4 percent share in the company by raising capital by €57.4 million.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company subscribed new shares to existing shareholders for €222,9 million.
In total, it raised its capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the whole group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of the sales.
Average contract growth is expected by 4 percent a year until 2017.
In his contract book, he has orders for EUR 2.6 billion, which is equivalent to four years of production.
French media say that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years of drip.
The Czech race in the Prague Letňany is important for groups.
16 percent contribute to the group's sales.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported a larger proportion of the State's coal fees.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of the municipalities' budgets is to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
From brown coal mining, the municipalities went about CZK 200 million and the state CZK 66 million.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration from the mining areas with permitted mining per thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments should continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities would receive CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million each year instead of CZK 14 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but it will be determined by the government's regulation.
The remuneration shall be newly calculated as the product of the quantity of minerals harvested and the rate for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by a government order might not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax because the state charges a mineral which is state property.
Only municipalities whose territory is affected by mining shall receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the community's money and one-quarter the state will receive.
The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive rock extraction.
The part of the money collected by the State on mining fees will be assigned.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mining rescue service.
The draft was criticized today by opposition MEPs who claimed, in particular, that they would harm communities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have been, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
A KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned about the increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully suggested rejecting the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for work.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are over 90 percent long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heat plants should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating costs, which would in particular mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to the Commission, the increase in employment fees is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur on Milan Urban's amendment (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before passing the law.
If coal goes beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the revenues for both the state and the municipalities, emphasized.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until after 2020.
The limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for reasons of social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve set to meet in two days on Wednesdays and Thursdays to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists addressed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and keep interest rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been a long time since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy has done quite well, there has been a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see great odds against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 CET.
Shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on that same day his colleague - wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, revealed on Tuesday the government authorities.
The Gautier police in Mississippi said that Lamb, a geography teacher and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10:00 p.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the cops to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there is a "cute dog" in the house that "will not bother anyone" but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why there was a shooting in the house.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a hand-written message from Lamba saying, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving a note, Lamb took a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
The dean of William LaForge University said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something going on in Mr Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, the government said that there was no "proof" of the "merciful triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was all shaken up.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were best friends.
According to Lindsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, Prentiss worked from the house online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police reported that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said that he was "not going to prison. "
When the police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he shot himself.
According to a CV published on the school's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta University in spring 2015.
Stars That Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All these things certainly take their toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and eliminated him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound was caused by a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw went into the PSF area.
Nine minutes he was treated on the playground, and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital. "
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's horrible - the guy who comes to Manchester at 18 is very hard, but he plays fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also had his oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture takes six months to heal and won't be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he'll still play this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can assess for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shawa's account says: "Thank you all for their messages, in words I cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger. "
Related: Manchaster United experienced an injury to Luke Shaw in the slaughter against PSF
The English defender will have an added incentive to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, a PSF coach, said: "It was a very nasty injury. "
When any player leaves the field with this kind of injury, everyone gets very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in a fight for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It is very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it is not good," Cocu said.
I haven't been able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview for PBS6, Moreno said: "I know how difficult it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm very sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child loves a book, it doesn't take long to learn it almost by heart.
You mustn't be David Cameron.
At the request of the child schematics provider, to name the favorite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax, chose the fable by Dr Seuss from 1971.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, I liked to read to my children because behind her was always a picture or message I had never seen before. "
All right, except that in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the story of a book by the 2012 elevator, which added other characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is a brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it was not suspicious enough itself, the text supplied by Cameron is read as the aggregate lift of the movie Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Since he was an open-minded practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be familiar with the story of a book where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the greedy, tree - cutting industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a crouched, moustache creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely such a relatively minor PR task was given a helper who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokesperson said the text probably came from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron's employee provided the text, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of leaving England, but still holding
Compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England has chosen on this tour, I don't think it will be very likely to repeat the 3-0 defeat she suffered last time in the trial series.
I wouldn't exactly rule out a guest win either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting lineup and also collective thinking is strong; they will not only carry the 2012 scars with youthful positivity.
With the ball Moeen Ali is developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the trial series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the team of England in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lytho is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were opposed to two good attacks in difficult conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no question marks around Joe Root's name, which led to an announcement because - and I mentioned this earlier - players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century years, and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there'll be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not 100%, and that does not surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much probationary time a batter gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats - just like Sam Robson did before him - while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you could scream for is that England first gave Jonathan Trotto a chance in the Caribbean - even though Lyth was in his best shape - but this wasted opportunity is already a thing of the past.
Here comes Alex Hales, and that's the batsman I judge very positively.
He's a x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all of this will depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was raised, and I have no objection to it.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't launch, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number three to them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 exams before his 2001 performance.
He immediately succeeded three centuries without even looking back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I was able to track him, I was impressed by him as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics - average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and I can see that as a prodigy, but there aren't a lot of spinners who raise their hands, and the selectors have chosen to be young.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made a few changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches can be a masterful move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who brings rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of a white-ball tour and brings both energy and merciless sparks to the team.
I've always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the locker room, although they are voices that say consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten up and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day leave, just as Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even if many disagree, coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy began to stagnate by 2017.
The unimaginable strategy of David Cameron's renegotiation for maintaining Britain in the EU gets into other troubles with every last day without choosing Jeremy's genius "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn will lead the Workers' Party, or Tuc will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and interfering changes to the treaty that they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the T.U.C. decided they didn't want it, even if social protection was invaded.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unwelcome Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, the German cautious Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes bad for her, as was the case with thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces reelection or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right hand side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their legs by helping the British selfie, who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP remarks during the campaign before the referendum 2017 in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, says a friend.
"Renegotiation solved the problem" and "British has nothing of value in negotiation."
Europeans know for their own harm how ferocious Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU the press oligarchs are barons because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benne in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at 2:1.
They can vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, a sly Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels newsletter "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-paying crooks, strangers hacking phones, and pseudo-unsea departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a frantic gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so she doesn't have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of a abolished EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and got him a card fired.
The press never forgave him either.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who, on Monday in Westminster, pat me on the back - I told him he couldn't waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-accepting Murdoch Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose seat he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, let me say it nicely, evolving.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the furious tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly approach that.
That's what Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on the radio and TV this week, when his inner scout couldn't agree to admit that Corbyn's appointment as Abrasive McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all times" - Benna's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said or what JC said to his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the report remains important in the ages of TV broadcasts and especially in the faith, the party of paranoia and treason, which are social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to take the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic sway over EU membership - in line with their Bennite surrounding the economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric debate between leftist dissidents, for which narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
Just as with his squirming about Nato - Tom Watson believes that JC's campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions, if it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even in reducing the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded of Monday's launch of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticize the review on electronics published by Public Health England
A statement by the government funded by the Agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people from whom some have a connection with the tobacco industry, reports researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published last month's "menage" report and described it as "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the complexity of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The editorial in Lancet magazine last month attacked the "extremely shaky base" on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ questioned the claim that was allegedly "built on a rock or sand. "
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness. "
They indicate that the public could expect that PHE's claim is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to produce an analysis of the multi-criterion (MCDA) decision of the model to synthesize their views on damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell stated that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had allegedly already received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report, stating.
One of the 12 participants admitted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding allegedly obtained previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they supply.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim industrial financing in newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The CHE meeting was also attended by tobacco management.
The report produced in this group "spokenly admits, " the lack of "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria, " wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, stated that the BMJ claims had already been answered earlier.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking. "
One of two lifetime smokers dies because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small compared to the long-term effects, but we must continue to examine them.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what they do not display, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases each year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, claims former Channel 4 director.
Former Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that only a handful of people are likely to be watching in difficult times compared to its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as the BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had failed to make contact with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is entering and transmitting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without contributions from the state," Johnson said in the Commission for Communication in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain license fees that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, at least in terms of programmes that are not produced or sold by others should be reduced.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the broadest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke and, of course, pointless.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regression tax should support programs that can be funded without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.
I can't understand how these public broadcasters are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial businessman who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC felt guilty by catching up with ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because it believed that this was the best way to secure long-term support. "
His commentary on the most popular BBC show repeats those by former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC would sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more pampered BBC public service programs "goes to BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they are going to their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn income from license fees, "but of course we are doing all these obscure programs that nobody is looking at."
They're transmitting at a time when no one's looking at them.
Regarding the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid that much because they don't look at the BBC that much.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production had now been classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio - and should take as a model of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "information, clarification and entertainment."
On the topic of partnership Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which were broadcast only a handful on TV, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or brain cell control using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction of the seals moving.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny seals change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have reported that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics that uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, reported to the Guardian daily that this method could one day replace a deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are injected into the patient's brain, which stimulate the brain.
The seals usually don't respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would occur when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves that then pass through the worm's body.
The enhanced ultrasound waves operate in the ion channels of TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some cells of worms.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate cells associated with them, reports Nature Communications magazine.
In order to control the seals using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When he used ultrasound on such modified worms, sound waves were amplified with microbubbles and transferred to worms where modified motor neurons were turned on.
In many ways, the new method resembles optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, was told that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired space in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissues without limitation and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be used in the treatment of insulin producing muscle cells and cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements disgrace the British arms trade.
Watch the Amnesty International anti-weapon market video.
Terrifying killer drones!
Sticks to the legs that break the ankles!
Slug shots!
And electric stun batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon of metaphors leave no doubt that this advertising at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through defense and security facilities of the International Veselice ExCeL Centre in the Docklands district of London.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with posters appearing at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Travel to DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using the font with the marks of the London metro with DLR lines becomes the image of the tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibit their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective called Special Patrol Group is helped to distribute throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs" which is £6 per piece of Allen keys, which allegedly "gets access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at Essex University, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists in the framework of protest movements and realize that they need to get out in the real world in order to have their art impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade of health travelers in the subway.
The video Amnesty was seen on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP, working without a claim to a fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising about the arms trade - he saw an empty space in the ExCeL calendar - and he thought: "Let's show them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were messing with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, we have achieved that it will attract more people. "
"They have done a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that it does not illegally deal with the torture device on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemist products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army to "on the arm of the launch AT4CS RS."
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it's not gonna be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life at student college
11 years ago, I moved to college as an unnoticed 19-year-old boy, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I had troubled - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorms can move from slightly to the nerves going up to totally awful.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, how you feel about Corbyne, and why "you don't honestly love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract of HAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to also take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find the people you love, and those you wouldn't even be talking to if your eyelashes were on fire and they were putting out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often change to a drinking reception, places of movie evenings and public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.

The Introverts in college come in short.
Your room should be a refuge, yet many dorms turn into an extra-room walk culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can go back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a knocking spot.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
A guy in my dorm used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Because you started going to college at the top of a bake mania, knocking on a stranger's door, and showing a plate of baked cookies seems a little less odd than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything will end with your face assigned to a tasty surprise.
That, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Miscondensed pieces of flour, sugar, and rigidity are likely to stop others from pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime on student dorms.
Of course, stealing a whole chicken is a crime, but is a drop of milk into your tea stealing?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're furious inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate who traded her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish a thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could keep the drum and bass down a little bit, because it was 3:00 a.m., and she had a test in the morning.
Their answer was to amplify music.
When they finally shut down at 5:00 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours, and then she played her own music out loud, locked the door and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same dorms as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be awkward if you mistook your roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't tell your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future wife, try talking to your weaknesses at least a little bit.
At an uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something - never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in a bottle of water that you then stick in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eve was looking forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva has had a hard time with her seven - year - old Vítek during pregnancy.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I dealt with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and I was looking for the positives.
Uncertainty and being alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for long, Eve remembers her first pregnancy today.
Already on the Internet, she met an older Vašek who started talking to them about their favorite films.
Vasek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the hospital, but he didn't rush into the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The motive of the third series of Czech TV series is to find happiness for the second attempt.
She managed to take care of Vitek and the family's financial security thanks to part-time work and great help from her mother and help her aunt.
In the end, the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not spoil your affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítk's second birthday, and he now sees Vašek as his father and also addresses him as such.
Even though Vasek already has two grown-up daughters, fatherhood in his 60s says he enjoys paternity and is also more devoted to children.
In addition to Vítek, two-year-old Leontínka and finally twins were added to them.
"Yours sailed into our family naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother never talked to me much," smiles Eva.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The Ema and Ela twins were born in a C-section after Eva was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of pregnant and manifest especially itching.
The disease is dangerous to an unborn fetus that is threatened with premature birth and death, most of which are self-destructed in the mother's postpartum.
Em and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vashkov, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emíček was placed in an incubator in an intermediary department where Vashkov's niece worked, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elina was bigger, and right after the transfer from ICU to my room I had her with me, describing the difficult period after Eve's birth.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until the doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
But waiting for children in the hospital did not make Eve happy.
"I was insane with my husband and children," recalls the hard times of six-month-old mother's separation.
She and her husband also considered signing the reverse, including because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
But this did not happen in the end, and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
The stories of the four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday night at 9:45 p.m.
Quite a large family can humble themselves.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with the electric two-hob and cramped conditions.
Although the house did not increase, Vašek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If it gets any worse, we'll take turns for a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially family well - being and pleasant atmosphere, not the size or dullness of the house.
So far, we've been working together very nicely, better than we expected.
While the mess is harder to hide in a small space, sometimes we overstep the rolling babies, but at least we're all close to each other, smiling Eve, who can find a positive side in every situation.
Your work as an illuminator in the film is not a guarantee of regular reception.
That's why he sometimes drives off to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, according to his words, care for the finances of the family and children physically copes, but how long will that be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, I will be the one to support this family someday," Eva admits when questioning the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
I'm not a big deal with four kids for an employer.
And if it gets worse, my husband and I can take turns in a cab, joking about a nice blonde.
Apple hit the jo-jo effect.
It's all the screens.
A more powerful processor, a camera with more resolution, a tighter chassis or a display that recognizes the power of the touch, these are in short the advantages of the recently introduced iPhones of the ninth generation.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The trend of Apple has been that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than that of the previous generation.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the failure of the news was really negligible.
However, this is far from true for new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for a smaller model, and by 20 grams for a larger model.
On the one hand, it's not surprising, last year's bending affair in Apple's pockets has suffered greatly.
The new chassis is made of more resistant aluminium alloy 7000, which also reflected on the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on her.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology for novelties, thanks to which displays recognize the power of touch.
For this it was necessary to provide the display with another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of displays of new iPhones increased more than twice over previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is achieved in this novelty thanks to the defatting cortex, which touched most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then the hardest used element of the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident in the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As much as the new display technology will be practical, it will only be reflected when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, 25 September, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Have the breakfast flakes been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, the archaeologists were able to find something that opens up interesting possibilities.
They found traces of a modern man from different times, including wall paintings, tool remnants and so on and so forth.
In the 23A layer, which is based on tools dating back to about 30,000 years ago, scientists discovered something that very much resembles the leftovers of the breakfast buffet.
There were traces of oat grains found on the site, which apparently went through the process of making such popular flakes today.
At the same time, the grains are first soaked, then dried, riddled with a so-called plough, then steamed and spread over the surface.
In the cave Paglicci managed to discover grains that were apparently warmed or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this suggests traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists failed to demonstrate in their publication for PNAS magazine that there was a complete process of making flakes in the cave, but the similarity is actually very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat cereal, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and possibly even warm enough, of course, is offered quite logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensive people used cereals long before agriculture began.
In fact, if the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes outrun agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station reports in the Transport Enterprise of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the names of the trolleybus stops: Nasty, Phantom, Phrázov, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was somewhat noisier, so the man's voice message was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops were reported in a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so it is better discernible than the deeper male voice in the deeper noise of traffic.
DMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, who didn't ask me, but it certainly chose from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a few decades, so I know the proper names of all these stops by heart, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who don't know each other in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and can say that the stop they were supposed to get to is not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer - but better again the announcer - should be made again, and this time, the colour of the normal traffic noise and the noise of the engine, in which the loudspeaker in the bus almost disappears.
So we don't have to keep listening to the names of the Water Heršpice, Šmírova stations, or then the Dorna in the screeching closet that I transferred to in Komárov.
I suppose my old-fashioned hearing didn't get so much worse all of a sudden on that one day when the stop announcer changed.
I understood those reports pretty well before that day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tracker's notes.
Nowadays, few know what the biggest and smartest in the Party's government were called comprehensive checks.
I took the liberty of remembering that.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was just seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't crash with your comrade chief, he came in the minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher remarked, while I was enrolling in the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write me that I'm going to the precincts to review the minor mechanization.
That's not gonna work. There's a background check today.
They're all fucked up, fucking awful.
What's going on?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
You'll be next.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of a uniform jacket.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran up to the second floor, without realizing the cold, sinister tone that the old man answered.
"You play," greeted me by engineer Eva, an elderly lady whom I greatly appreciated.
She said she was even chief before the comrades deposed her.
They're background checks, and you're gonna be there.
How many times have I asked what these comprehensive background checks are, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they're once every three years, everybody has to go to them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
For some, at least.
They say I'll see.
I pulled a fascic from the drawer with periodic reports and a phone on it.
"It's Holcman, come to me right away," the chief's voice came in.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing ..." mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts only.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I have come to your command," I said, "I have joined the chieftain's office.
The chief was sitting behind a desk looking at some kind of paper.
"Comrade mechanic," he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully examining the paper, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the paper on the table, leaned into the back of his chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly gaze.
I didn't know.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy commended myself that I had worked very well over the past few months in office and that he was very pleased with me.
That the chief was very good when he pulled me out of the platoon to distance.
And now this?
Remember, you're a line distance technician, and you have to act accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I've been stuttering that I've been using this greeting since I was a kid, that I've been so raised and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
"You're on a socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work," popped the high chief.
Plus, you're still confusing calling your superiors.
One day you say "sir" and the other, "comrade."
But I'm no chieftain to you, but comrade chief.
The Deputys are comrades of the Deputys, the High Masters are the Comrades of the High Masters!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a normal citizen's greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," said the chief, coldly, who in the meantime calmed down a bit.
We'll talk about it later.
Anyway, remember, the chair upstairs isn't prepaid for retirement.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good with the person.
For a while, he pierced me with a cold, prickly look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also pissed off about his condescending calling.
He was only a few years older and played God, actually comrade of God.
Jovial, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as he could use right now.
He's been banished by everyone.
So be it, he's the chief.
In fact, not all of us, the chairman of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-scorers, called him.
But the chief was calling many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He just wiped me out for total bullshit.
I thought something about an asshole, and it cost me enough not to shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to being a pickaxe again, let alone a railroad clerk.
What would I feed two kids on?
And a built-up house!
I've been crying, but I've gotten over it.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief finished the audience and began to carefully examine the paper he had in his hand again.
I was subpoenaed at 11:30.
Everyone in the office has been there, and they've been asking questions about how and how, they're saying that it's gonna be okay.
Only Jožin bitingly uttered how his custom used to be, that they couldn't throw us all out, because comrade chief would have to do the job alone with his faithful, and that he wasn't in danger.
At the same time, the word "comrade " emphasized as if he knew what the old man wiped me out for this morning.
There was a nice gathering at the chieftain's office.
Comrade Chief behind his desk and at a long advisory table, other comrades who should have decided on my official existence or my absence.
Kádrák, Chairman of the ROH, Writer of Personnel, Special Purpose Officer, sort of contras in the army, and Deputy Director, my boss.
And the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from a long time ago.
An ordinary track worker, he was brimming with sleepers or pitchforks throwing gravel.
But also a former guard.
Rumor has it he wasn't used to be funny at the time, apparently, a pretty beast.
Bad languages said the school went out in seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up on the road to the pickaxe.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief instructed me to sit down.
There was a little soul inside me, an unswallowable cone in my throat.
Kádrák read the opinion from the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
So far so good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then an assessment from the street organization of the party.
He copied the report from the Civil Committee, hopefully they were both written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of long-time party members, refused to appear before the examination committee, and subsequently stepped forward from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked sharp at me.
Kádrák noticed and stopped reading.
The chief instructed him to proceed.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was won as a candidate for the party.
Regardless of the parents who stepped up from the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding other than at the National Committee at church.
I failed the trust of the party in the worst way.
That's why I was cut off from her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I gave a church funeral, although she was an ex - party member.
All of this shows a negative attitude towards the party's leading role.
When he finished reading, only tapping the chief's pencil into the table board interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating in my mind the "communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could fix the switches without some fucking background check.
But now?
The career of the railroad clerk took it as hers before it started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think so. I'm sure the chief will fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade here?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question for a cadre.
Well, according to a previous employment report.
Do you have it here?
Apparently, Kadrek wasn't twice.
On the scrapings of sweat, he blinked nervously, as if he were being examined.
He nodded jealously and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," the chief said, with a hint of jivia, which was often a foretaste of the storm.
At first sight all praise, taught with honours, graduated from the industrial industry, worked as a locksmith in the task force, fulfilled the standard on average to a hundred and twenty percent.
But the important thing is missing.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade?" he turned again to a cadre who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him and that he might not be a cadre very soon.
The comrade gave it to me when he came in.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct in the platoon," bled the cadre.
And there's no need for a test report, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were assigned to the technical function, this piece of paper was enough for you," said the chief.
The cadre blinked nervously and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss this later," the chief closed the matter and the cadre was clearly relieved.
For now, he's made it.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
He's calling me out all of a sudden, so that's it!
My eyes were dark, my eyes were hot.
There was a rush of remorse and accusations, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world that didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That by planting an incomplete opinion, I had misled comrade Caddy's reporter, and I didn't understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from the cadre at the factory.
I am also an antisocialist element who, at the time of building real socialism, supports religious darkening, even participating in them.
That, that, there was a lot I did, or maybe I'll still commit and pray quietly for it to end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I flew out of a mechanic's position.
I didn't care if they took my pick.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of comrade chief.
"That's enough, comrade chief," suddenly the party chairman answered and strongly interrupted the chief's levities.
Comrade here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did something stupid!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than shutting his door to the side for a while!
To open it again, it will have to prove that it has changed, that it is once again worthy of our trust.
An uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he so well-read or parachuted phrases from partisan training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must have a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young fellow, the truth, a somewhat misguided comrade, in his efforts to make amends!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
Comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she doesn't just punish, she does love.
When the chairman finished, no one even listened.
No one expected such a turnaround.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," the chief iced in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's the conclusion I was going to make.
Everyone nodded with their heads in agreement, but they didn't believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the function of independent care officer for basic means," I shrouded on my return to the office and then I started crying.
It's a good thing everyone was at lunch except for engineer Eva.
She was silently listening to my incoherent appearance of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I'd like some coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the stove and made cups.
In the meantime, she's been talking about currant practices.
As one opinion, often full of praise, is put in a man's hand, and the other, with all the dirt in it, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to end up, but on the road to the pickaxe, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he could eat or drink, and that's how it turned out.
"He's gonna get it from the old man," she remarked viciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Be careful with him anyway, he's vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a much worse chief, no humanitarian.
Zero from a pickaxe with great power.
The coffee water started to boil and the office then filled with the scent of just watered coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in the cup and shuffled a hot potion in silence.
I hope I'm out of the woods.
I'm not gonna get fired now, and I'm three years from now.
Anyway, comrade chief won't forget me today.

The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from far away because it is located on a 15-meter high mast.
People in the surrounding area call him "the fan on Chlum."
For the village 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal sign, which the village acquired for the occasion of the reunion of natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time and of course we wanted a fan on the sign, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum Wind Pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds people of the time when they fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
It wasn't until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided on a solution that was suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch of Číchov, they had a well excavated seven metres deep.
Three years later, they added a metal structure with a wind pump that pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě with a load of CZK 2,400," says the memorial sign on the ground floor of the mast structure.
After several repairs and windfalls, the pump served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the water struggle began to be written: on that day in Chlum, a new water supply began to serve.
The wind pump has remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and the local rarity.
The dominant got operational at this year's native reunion.
It wasn't until 2008 that the Chlums decided to repair the windmill again and put it back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel produced - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The bike was mounted on a mast, but it had to be brought down the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose suitable material and the wheel could not resist wind gusts.
Then the Chlum Dominant rested under the roof for several years.
Since this June, however, the wheel on the high mast has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of natives, the village had the replica of the wheel adjusted and repositioned it at the top of the iron tower.
But the bike only draws useful water from the well into an ambush-blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the well.
At least it was spinning empty-handed.
"In autumn we will disconnect the windwheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind bike entered the municipal sign, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole Highlands.
They have a similar element in the sign in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelena Hora in Vyškovsk, in Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice in Přerovsk or in the Police in Vsetínsk.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed to the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone else in my career," smiled 34-year-old Goian at a pre-match press conference.
That's when George Hagi trained us. It was a shame we lost.
I hope to score Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who has played 60 games for the Romanian representation, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a hitchhiker, he'll face the spartan offensive raids.
A few thousand people are coming, no hell, saying about the Greek battle of the Spartan Hybsh.
And he's got some idea what's coming to him on Thursday night.
I well know Fatai, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
That's when I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good assailant, which is why he went to Sparta, said Goian.
He did not name other footballers of the Prague club, so there was a direct question whether he knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a slightly annoying look he aimed at Czech journalists.
The clueless look on his face was, "Why are you asking me this?"
After a while, the silence went off.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of teamwork.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from larger clubs, one can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such their organizer of the game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Although Goian has had the best years, he boasts a very interesting football resume.
At his time Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester units of United and City, from Steauy but headed to Italian Palermo, also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're expecting aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European cups, fighting for victory in the Czech league.
For me, he's the favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group off with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalie Tomáš Košický, who is looking forward to the competition from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But I can say for the whole team that we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new mansion should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no factual impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the registered office of the group, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the prospectus of the security, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval shortly.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the associated transfers of shares will take the form of a non-public transaction involving only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or to new investors under this operation.
"The possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," said the company.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The Czech Television objectivity test in information on the migration crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the news of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time broadcast the main news session of Czech Television.
And how did she survive?
When they teach journalism at the faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today's Czech Television Events.
The migration crisis was devoted to about 80% of the news broadcasts.
Except for the first minute, when the ČT informed about the riots at the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers called them euphemistically out of patience - throwing stones and attacking metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already going - judge the names of individual reports themselves.
The criticism of NGOs - a great deal of space for non-profit organisations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Escapers wandering - ČT consistently uses the terms of refugees or refugees and not migrants.
The main thing is that the CT in illustration footage is consistently used only and only by small children and women.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part propaganda that has no parallel from communist ags.
I must say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I got up to a flat once, I soon stopped being the only resident.
My ponds moved into the umakart toilet.
Domestic fishermen, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not losing that transformation from caterpillar to beetle and cub looks like an adult individual, just tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I wasn't lingering to kill them.
First by hand and later by chemical.
Socialist drugstores provided some kind of blue crystals to dispose of them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But they were successfully wiped out.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs similarly.
A box of some kind of juvenalizer that the ants brought into their nest, and then he wouldn't allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I took a turn.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I increasingly leaned toward the view that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and can replace one pest with another.
The truth about fleas and bedbugs, I wouldn't worry about getting karma worse by killing them.
In the new home, my partner and I agreed that if we didn't have the ponds crawling around our necks, they'd eat the flakes of the apostate skin, some invisible algae and all that.
Their peaceful existence after a while was disturbed by a spider.
He was a common type of wanderer who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he was living off the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he mainly feeds on ponds and that his number apparently kept to a tolerable number.
We found it to be a female by intimate regular contact with every need we had.
Because we have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third less, as he carefully cries out on web fibers to avoid being eaten before reaching the desired copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move or respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought he was past it, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
Soon they disappeared.
They were eaten by mommy in part, and they scattered in part elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the great-great-great-resident of the toilet.
For some time, she carefully observed our behavior from the ceiling and evaluated our non-attacks as friendship by moving under the toilet bowl.
The numerous condition of the somewhat multiplied ponds fell again and the spider kept his usual activities calm to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
In the meantime, our daughter has reached an age when the use of a potty was already a disgrace.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've already eaten forever to spill its contents.
We encouraged her more and more to use the toilet.
However, her daughter found an excuse to maintain her habit in that spider, which she saw very well while wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider didn't take any luck in the house.
Crying and screaming, she forced her potty.
There was no choice.
There was a time when a spider had to be commanded, for the sake of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a jar and banished through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt awful after so long of living together as if I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the ponds would start to appear more often and begin to multiply with a geometric series.
Wonder for the world, a week, two, we didn't find one.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider in the ant pattern was growing there, that the bathroom environment wasn't as good for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were crawling again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found out that their connection to the spider must have had a cause for not seeing it, that it was hidden in some other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some sort of telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance caused some kind of alarm reaction.
All the more reason I don't have any illusions about their eyesight.
Some light showed shyness, but that they would react to waving hands or fast movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think she's already forgotten about the potty.
All that's left is to attract some spider again.
I'm already broadcasting my wishes on the air, and I hope they didn't forget about me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that B Cyclone.
The ten words of Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
Humankind may never cease to be fascinated by the words of a brilliant scientist of the last century.
He was able to sink so deep into everything that the figment was always a staggering discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
The consciousness of people came first of all with its special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
Its explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantising the electromagnetic field can also not be forgotten.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is so complex for many that it prefers easy approaches for closer acquaintances.
But it is not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: The watch near your lover seems to be a minute; a minute in the hot oven seems an hour - and that is relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing out of his whole plyad of famous quotes these ten, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius try not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No number of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one who can prove me wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If a mess on the table is a reflection of a mess in the mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what it's gonna be in World War III, but in the fourth, it's gonna be sticks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive myself not to mention Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are expecting changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success considering that all four remain in black numbers this year," said Captain Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of regional facilities at this time is about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher remuneration from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, constructions will cost nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
A long time ago, when we were shopping mainly for machines, it was over.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them the top health care cannot be done, the Regional Deputy Minister for Health Lubomír Nečas justified the plans.
They look forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, they now collect suppliers of the new internal pavilion for nearly 300 million crowns.
They have a dialysis extension scheduled in Kromeriz.
Uherské Hradiště wants to build a new intern for about 200 million this year's open central pavilion.
And Zlín's Bata Hospital awaits a long postponed construction of a new central income and an intern for which it will take three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said Věra Prousková, director of the hospital, for example, on the construction of the Vsetín interna.
The five-storey building is supposed to be ready in about two years and will offer comfortable facilities for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
More comfort for patients.
Changes, which are widely recognized mainly by patients, will affect all regions.
New buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, beds are inconclusive, windows leak and health professionals do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our inn was built 35 years ago and is now at the limit of its lifetime," said the director of Zlín hospital Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, in addition to new premises.
The same model is halfway through Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing and within three years an intern will be added to it.
"We will pay the construction from credit and partly from own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
She still has the highest profit and didn't make it to the loss two years ago, when the zlin hospital, for example, faced almost $200 million loss.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients in Kroměříž hospital will also receive improvement.
Within 10 to 15 years he will go to repairs, new instruments and reconstruction of up to half a billion crowns.
This year, the detention station will be repaired, then the dialysis extension will begin, or the building will be built for a new MRI.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Czech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that other countries are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
He also notes that no one has explained to him how he should keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came at the meetings of the European Union's interior and foreign ministers?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot function.
We can't talk about migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they've got relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to maintain migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive an answer, which is why we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border control, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But say quotas solve everything?
We were talking about 40,000 a while ago, now it's $100,000.
When will it be 500 grand?
And how are we gonna keep these people on the ground?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese people, and others who take the Czech Republic as their target country, are seeking asylum with us, but the interest of people in this migration wave, from Syria and other countries, is limitedly close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees didn't really want to come, but we've already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them this way?
We're committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border control, military operation.
Even with the 1500s, there are 1,100 people coming in to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we treat the ones we intercepted.
It is a big question, and we will be debating this with Europe if we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe treats it so that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
This means they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, we may not be able to keep the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will go back to Germany when they arrive.
If we can hold them off during the asylum procedure, we'll deal with them in the asylum procedure.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, then almost 98 percent of Europe's statistics have gained international protection.
Then they will be given documents that will enable them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are 400 people who will be resettled.
This is the second project that is currently under way, and there we have only made progress in debating with the churches the possibility of helping them to find employment, accommodation and so on.
But that's a run on a very long track.
You said the other states were unwilling to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But isn't it just that the Czech Republic is rejecting quotas, but does it offer no solidarity action to unblock the debate?
And what exactly do you think that's solidarity?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all Syrian migrants can join them, the report spreads within hours of all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This calls for another migration wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect external borders - simply to discourage those migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Definitely let them know they don't stand a chance.
Only last year, 50,000 Kosova came to Germany.
From a secure Kosovo where we pay for all of this state's sats, including police, courts, prosecutors.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, 50 percent of what social systems are spending on them in vain today could go on refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced checks, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day was twelve.
How far is this going to go to make border controls even tighter?
We were afraid of being captured by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we handle.
We still have several hundred vacant sites in stone detention facilities.
Of course, we will return all the people we hold back to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, it's complicated with Hungary, and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where's the break point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days, will exhaust our capacity enough to take on crisis plans.
Then I'm agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation were to arise, the government could sit down de facto immediately, and with one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police on the military, let's say customs, or prison service.
The regional option is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can come to this.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large amount of debt at the last minute.
They're trying to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid her debts.
The footballers got their money.
Soccer Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after Online Services from the Pacific Samoa submitted a proposal for it for approximately CZK 20 million.
Attorney Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzl within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And I have to say, she did.
One of the main arguments was that before last week, the new owner of Slavia was the great Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimána.
Apparently, money arrived from the new owners at the club at the last minute.
This is also demonstrated by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the Vršovice Club on Monday, just the day before the hearing in court, sent over tens of millions of crowns owed.
"Everything was paid between September 11th and September 15th," Slavia Mládková said.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, Slovak ex-present Milan Ivan or Czech backup Mario Lička.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday the club paid due fees of the city district of Prague 10.
The insolvency dispute thus leaves de facto only the claims that the Slavie contradicts.
According to the club, the liabilities have not been incurred at all, or there are litigations against them.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of losing these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can provide with a statement from the account," Judge Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that was overdue is paid," Mládková said and added that only outstanding or contradictory liabilities were paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts.
All evidence will then be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the negotiations to continue on 3 November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of top technology, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular design brings benefits and quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
From welding of structural steel to welding of special alloys as well as from welding of rough materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
An incredible amount of welding curves, simple adjustment and expansion of the welding power supply allows you to react quickly to change requirements, resulting in a decrease in downtime, the need to reposition the power supply and more productive welding.
FastMig X allows welding by top welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of welding.
No more time to waste and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty contentions.
The flexibility is ensured, there are fewer downtimes, more welding and higher profits.
It is this year's novelty, which was premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these honours very much, as they confirm the exceptionalness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameters, FastMig X belongs to the world's top.
There are certainly pleasant delivery times for those interested, which are around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic we have already established the first contacts, which will definitely expand after the Brno trade fair.
We have been his regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before him, stressing for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, the head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka was built so she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could have been beaten even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka Tunnel Complex could be built so that there would not be two slumps of soil in Stromovka Prague, claims the production director of Satra, who is the main tunnel designer, Alexandr Butovič.
He said it on Wednesday evening during a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will be opened on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a price-to-security compromise.
"Tunel could have been hit more safely, but the costs are rising exponentially," said Butovic.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all along, but the country fell only a few steps from where it began to travel by a safer and more careful method.
"If the measures were applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," said Butovič.
Blanka Tunnel fell three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land fell into the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Běhlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
The construction was intended to cost CZK 17 billion according to the original plan.
Adding to that VAT that has jumped twice over the construction period, you're twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
Adding technology, land purchases and engineering, valorisation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37 as he said,
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple update
A new operating system can be requested in Settings by clicking on the "General" tab and selecting "Software Update" (software update).
When it's ready, it offers you the opportunity to download your phone and then install it.
Some users dealt with the installation problem, namely the error message "Software Update Failed'.
One solution to this problem is to wait for an interest in updating or try to do it through iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the update process.
And this, including the need to uninstall the apps to release the site - this will not be necessary, because Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the whole process by using a special tool that will propose user applications to delete and re-install after the update.
Make sure your phone is loaded before you start the update.
If the battery state is low, Apple will not allow you to start the update, because interrupting the process could cause an update error.
Other messages: iOS 9 release has not been postponed, despite the delay of WatchOS; iOS 9: reviews exciting updates to the new version of the operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of the new operating system for iPhone

FedEx profits mixed, reduction of fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge decrease in annual profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the terrestrial division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period last year FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
Company shares dropped by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx reports that it expects a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook, despite an increase in interest rates of 4.9 percent on average, is reflected in January. 4, and higher costs for the land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company claimed that it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost reduction, higher income and growth in online trading.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of Fred Smith said that the company "despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade. "
Holiday rental plans were announced the day after UPS' rival company stated that it plans to hire between 90 000 and 95 000 extra workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales went up 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, which has caused revenues to stagnate in its Express Unit.
But the boom in online shopping boosted the results of the ground unit FedEx.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before opening FedEx's shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the 11th June record.
At their most anticipated meeting over the years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week seated at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table and decide whether after nearly ten years the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
Following them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to give the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be an X factor too close to the foreseeable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy has been ready to start shutting down from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data show solid economic growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could already frighten the cautious Fed by adding to volatility by increasing its federal funds reference rate - no more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour and inflation market will first and foremost be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the level, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances to increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raised rates only if politicians softened the decline by promising that further increases are not in sight.
On Tuesday industrial average Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.
The meeting was launched by the expectation that the Fed politicians will hold the rates in peace this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed had now raised the rates," he says.
If the Fed politicians had done so, "they would have to go to the extreme in their programming statement and hold hands with the financial markets so as not to panic. "
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm the financial markets, as it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slow tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the power of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that, through spring and early summer, she expected an increase in rates this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of a pickup.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, the Fed politicians argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, in view of the shortness of the labour market, " said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to topple at the end of last month after China devaluation its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones dropped by up to 16% below its record value in May when investors were afraid that slowing China's economy would go down global growth.
The market slightly bounced in this month and now Dow is losing only almost 10% of May's maximum.
The Fed's policy makers are given a comprehensive calculation of how to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and reports on China's economy's weakness in the last few weeks, this meeting would have been tightened," said Stephen D. Oliner, head researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on regarding the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
The health situation of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decisions.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint of Ben S. Bernanke's then president in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered spasms all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but they also consult other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, the head of the global strategy for the wealth-management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., remarked this month that "The Fed has a history of excessive movements in financial markets that seem to be inconsistent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the open market committee's policymaking, who pushed for an increase in rates, quoted the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0,75 percentage points during three sessions "Despite the limited identifiable effects on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prefer to worry about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England tariff committee.
The latest turmoil is not even close to this level, he said.
"You certainly do not want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets have become angry," said Posen, President of the Institute for International Economics Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/stock is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
Even the car part is available if you need a little motor oil.
The store is massive, and it'll take you over an hour to get through all the aisles.
If you are hungry from all this shopping, go to LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal business stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various sampling points.
What is in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
The limits of fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is large, such as fish - the employees behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezing section where you will find frozen carrot leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork guts, fish balls, regional sausages, free-market preparations and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Wide alleys come up to shopping trolleys and forklifts.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be occupied, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways stays the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h has been denied by the House.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum allowed speed up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to accept the Senate's amendment, which refused to increase speed.
The amendment to the Road Act will now head to the President.
President Miloš Zeman said by the end of April that the law allowing speed of 150 miles would veto.
The Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for this speed.
On Tuesday, before the Members supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-current ones, in line with the original government proposal.
The House first extended this possibility to motorways on which it could be driven in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
Senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, have also removed the authorisation of the transport police to have the last word in the modification of local roads, which the municipalities take care of.
The Senate version approved by the House also envisages that sewerage, water pipes or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally below the road surface.
The municipalities would save so much for buying land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and facilitate the handling of towed vehicles to which owners do not apply.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles which their owners would not register for within a six-month period after notification of the withdrawal.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of a fine even for forwarding companies.
The amendment also eliminates the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of existing paper stamps, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it saves money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí ex-primator is going to trial.
He's facing 10 years for overwhelming the welcome of the citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project Welcome to the Municipalities.
Police wanted to prosecute Commissioner Zuzana Kail (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not release her.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, they're both at risk for up to ten years in prison.
The main trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to State's Attorney Mandík and Macik, at least one million crowns of damage was caused, according to the prosecution.
The applicant shall rely on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city's management have, by virtue of their duties, unlawfully enabled the company that organised the welcome of citizens to acquire property.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then chief of the municipal services, education and culture department to address five connected companies in the tender.
When another company offered the lowest price entered the competition, the town hall canceled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the contract to the administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both accusations conducted in order to ensure the award of a public contract for Darothore for the organisation of the Welcome to Ústí nad Labem event have acted in a long-term and coordinated manner least contrary to the requirement for a proper economic care procedure, writes the prosecutor.
At the same time, they were aware that, following the acquisition of this contract, Darothore would charge Ústí nad Labem a price for the implementation of the Welcome of the Municipalities event, which would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid only one part, approximately CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was overpriced by at least a million crowns.
Mandík has previously rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this deconstructed case, said the former mayor before, saying that the city under his leadership only followed up on a similar project from past years.
Between 2008 and 2010, Roxy II provided the event.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," Mandík added.
CSIs originally wanted to accuse Ms Kailová, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it for prosecution.
CSIs have therefore postponed the case in her case, but are counting on Kail being charged after her parliamentary mandate has ended.
The welcoming of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns to buy children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly released a dog on a fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
The Hungarian police reportedly detained the AP cameraman shortly at the border with Serbia and forced him to delete the footage of a police dog allegedly knocked a fugitive to the ground.
But the Hungarian Government is questioning this accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through the cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
Police intervened against the refugees, and one of them had a dog attack a Syrian with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," fell down, says the Muzi.
The fact that Muze is filming everything, one of the cops noticed and didn't let him leave.
The journalist was not allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The police took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the footage.
The men thus lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt threatened because there were dogs nearby.
The AP agency sent a protest letter to the spokesperson of the Hungarian Government Zoltan Kovács.
The behaviour of police officers was unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and fear that the government will destroy the legally acquired material.
Kovács challenged the police report of Muzi's trial.
He said the cops just wanted the press to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they had a right to do.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't make him erase anything.
"Dogs can bark - they are trained to scare and scare a little bit, but they certainly did not attack," says Kovács.
The Unpredictable League of Masters.
The City win kicks us, trusts Juventus
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," turned Manuel Pellegrini's head, coach of home city.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic championship league game.
Not one team has created many opportunities, but we've had the ball on football for longer.
"The cause of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," Pellegrini evaluated the match, whose team collected in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last season Juventus was on the exact opposite side before the mutual encounter - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has only a point as defender of the title and a score of 2:4 is only on the 16th place of the table.
That is why the turnaround to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manchukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, hopefully we'll hit the winning wave thanks to it," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
That's what my players deserve.
"Before our balancing goal, we were able to collect at 0:2 but Gianluigi held us," said coach Allegri goalman Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances," regretted Yayu Touré, the backup of City.
We need to take experience from the League of Masters and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye, Angela, goodbye, old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media squeezing around is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies carrying on their parents' hands on dusty exodus roads.
And this automatically causes guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they don't just come here desperate kids, notice in the footage of the landing boats to the Greek islands that the children aren't that visible!
Well, we've been missing pictures of ships headed for Lampedusa recently from the French border at Menton, where thousands of young men lie on the beautiful promenade.
Mostly young Negroes.
And there's also pictures of Callais gone, where these guys eat and black men wait to see if they can make it through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's into it anymore.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of Eritrea did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.
There was too much fakeness.
So, when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of covered up that it's not just unfortunate Syrian babies, it's also secretive - for older people: fashion-fashioned - young men.
Whose musculoskeletal looks like they just came out of a gym.
There's only one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on a private beach hotel.
Regardless of the fact that it was private, a large group of cars arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And out of them came the young Negroes.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They walked into the beach, all dressed up in designer clothes and shoes. In their hands, of course, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they were not interested and employees - Turks, Muslims! - were clearly afraid of them.
They've taken all the deck chairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of a hat with nails, white and colored Adidas on the legs.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started feasting.
They cast tables around them, stuffed themselves next to sitting dark and white bar guests - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled the dining terrace somewhere quiet.
Incoming Negroes drank beer directly from thirds - as in series from USA?! - on the beach they threw empty bottles around.
They kept yelling loudly at each other.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight out of bottles.
They jumped into the hotel swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially those young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, mothers with children and pensioners ran terribly away and in half an hour there was no one in the beach or in the pool.
Everyone's gone.
Whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't get it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered: "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had, like, a 20-inch massive gold cross on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are those drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw them drinking," said the waiter.
Drugs don't smuggle or use.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
But the Secret Service and the top politicians should have known first.
They don't seem to know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, the European Union's main problem has been that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly recognized main forces in Europe - lie, lie, and lie - but not only they, but also EU leaders and television, including ours.
For example, recent TV pictures of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the August 1968 pictures of Moscow television.
Of course, there were a few sunmen at the station, but mostly - the ancient German - Muslims welcomed their comrades.
For weeks, they babbled on the news on Czech TV, saying that according to some research, the Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
Of course, who was only in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by further information.
For example, famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association public television companies Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs were talking about.
However, they withheld what burst in Germany the next day: that in the poll vote for the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago: "Our efforts to achieve a multi-culture were totally unsuccessful by the company. "
She then said: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society. "
"All efforts to live together like this have failed completely."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, according to her, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating. Today they live with us and for some time we lied to ourselves that they would not stay, that one day they would disappear again.
That's not real.
The multicultural approach, when we say that we simply live happily next to each other, has failed.
Totally failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, a Member for the SPD, the only one who is supposedly not even a senior in the European Parliament - yes, that is the one that Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said could play a concentration room from a minute to a minute - has shown himself more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last statements made by German politicians, that Germany exceeded the Rubikon.
Let us note that, apart from some, most European politicians do not support these statements, statesmen of countries that have been victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have spent years trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their horrible past as aggressor and murderer millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is planted in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when all his strength was stopped by attempts by the Great Germans to control the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say that Germany's great German idea would be destroyed?
I guess he did.
When they shut it down, the preparation for World War I began.
The idea of the Great German who led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives probably came back in a different form.
After an attempt by the Marxists to dominate the state, such as the Rote Armee Fraction, and after the failure of the GDR, new German ideologies began to develop in Germany based on ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main ideas of Nazism.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving alone all those fighters against the atom, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi motto Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy restless young people everywhere who want to do something different and better, they fully leaned to the side of the warriors against the heating of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic stream that sees all Slavs as a difficult word - since Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as Schulz and the German minsters' last statements show, the idea of Germany as a leader openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states.
Which needs to be listened to without question.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we involve the fact that immigrants are a highly influenced group of voters, we have what we have.
And as always, capital is behind this, especially the German that suits it, which is because Germany actually controls most of Europe's states through banks and the Union.
The pseudo-belief of the sunmen first led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it brought them home and may even bring millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by siren voices, soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and start to rebel.
Once again, Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force, once again, a part of its population - but it seems that a smaller part - can become ideologically infatuated, but eventually, reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
To whom will Muslims come to help for a long time living in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, engage in fear of Islamizing their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and even to Germany, when people rise up who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-over-human Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has sparked the support of solar ideology in Europe, i.e. the ideology of elitist and basically totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of insolent conduct against disobedient democratic Germans and all inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy dealers: scare them to death.
Just knock and a sturdy knock on you in a way that a weaker nature may not stand.
A lively head will wipe you out nicely and drive you away stiff, accompany you (or rather drive you away) a persistent salesman and animated statue.
Perhaps it's a pity that a talking knocker can't be bought even in reality.
We could use a lot of peek-a-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-bo
Juices (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it is located among the outside tiles near my residence.
On 16 September 2015, I took a picture of a beautiful plant, which is part of the expansionary weeds, but it gives a beautiful impression in terms of flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's erratic, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a dryer environment, easy to adapt, modest and easy to do.
Although it creates leaves with chaotic compositions, it is worth watching and taking photos.
The beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment are still under the small view.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Society SPRS has come up with a shocking way of trying to convey to women the importance of a good diet while breastfeeding using pictures of children sucking out of their breasts painted with an unhealthy meal.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic formation of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have negatively affected the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead on the Today Show.
By fleeing Karel Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry to cover the costs of leaking the liberal leadership, we have not been able to create enough ratings for Today.
This morning's Nine show screened from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage is stuck in London as part of a week long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance did not seem to matter so much to Aussie TV viewers because it recorded 397,000 viewers in five major cities in averages compared to 330,000 Today's audiences.
Today recorded a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the Sunrise gap in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than just parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has on average a very impressive 1,219 million spectators.
The critics wondered if Thomson himself could tighten the TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven kept a strong 1,136 million spectators, thus smoothly defeating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30) introduced by Andrew O'Keefe' had an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the other half of the incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in the second night's review of The Chase Australia, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will win at 5:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a Million Dollar Minute that couldn't beat the McGuire show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secrets revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who was going to win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay standing won't reveal who's the one who's gonna get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's finale.
All three women were lyrically chanting why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
Anyway, on the question, "If not, so which gets Wood's final flower?" their answers could work as a co-conspirator about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one best suited to Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared an easy relationship from a certain day forward.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt that they were compatible enough and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," said Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're fine and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visit home, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," he said.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, to look mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snezena and Lana indecisive.
Bachalor is airing on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after moving him to the United States, and a lot of teams were asking for his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit down for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was the convert of the Australian rugbi league at the first pitch kick in Tuesday's 8:3 to Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing up the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only take care of another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing when he left the field after the mistake and later told the Australian Hamish & Andy radio duo at 2DayFM 104.1 a worse career start in the NFL couldn't even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared awkwardness to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goal area led to a threesome of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin will meet in a debate on homosexual rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested in gun pointed at the Siberian runway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S. stood up for emigrants who sought compensation for property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989 it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the Act on Out-of-court Rehabilitation.
The Court of First Instance first granted them the amount requested, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by granting them only less than CZK 90 thousand, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation was determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants stood up for the Supreme Court and gave them the original amount of the defendant.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to complaints about the US.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - even if it constituted an adequate compensation in relation to the immovable property withdrawn - is now only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot be a burden on the secondary participants as part of the restitution of entitled persons who have claimed their rights since at least 1995 and who have not been able to obtain compensation before," explained Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, the rapporteur, why the ÚS took sides with the emigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly stated that the general courts should act in restitution cases in such a way that possible irregularities are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation should always be achieved, i.e. the reparation of property injustice caused by acts of an earlier totalitarian state," added the judge.
Evita in the musical Studio TVA will now perform Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, by the way, became world's youngest Evita, when in 1998 she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perónová in the first Czech performance of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timeo Rice in the Prague Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, he says: "Today, Evita's intensity was not equal. "
Because Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monika Absolone for the role of First Lady of Argentina.
I saw Monca three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring to me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm quite a fan of more modern modifications, but this one is just particularly good.
"Ondřej Sokol's direction is original, lightened and contemporary," Fišarová notes.
The imaginary handover of the musical sceptre between the two singers will take place at the Monika Absolone's Birthday Concert on September 27th at the theatre Studio DVA.
Tonight will culminate in the compositions of Evita's musical.
The experiences will certainly include a joint duet of Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In the limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also take a leak from the overhead counter when he represents Karel Roden as President of Perón during the filming.
Due to public interest, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita presents the theatre Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondřej Sokola the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolonová.
Karel Roden appears at her side as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenachik.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who has already participated in the first performance at the Spirál Theatre.
4 people killed after police officers shot rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protestors against the proposal of a new state constitution, said the official on Wednesday.
There was violence Tuesday night in Rupandeh District, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district officer, reports that more than 1000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resorted to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, reports.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in Western Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the emergence of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent encounters, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week in Kathmandu on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials state that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We certainly mustn't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of the Championship Litvínov you did not even a home duel with Sparta hockey players (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly catastrophic entry into the extra league as a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.
Honor Folk.
NHC predicts a 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde's southernmost islands is likely to be 60 percent in the formation of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday the National Hurricane Center.
Another well-defined low-pressure system around the middle of Cape Verde's islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 percent probability of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added a weather forecast based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it is launching a campaign aimed at raising 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states fleeing war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on his blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted a message on her blog based on personal experience as a seven - year - old fleeing with her family from Kabul.
"We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," said Masoudová.
I was lucky.
But more and more families like mine are willing to help the worsening immigrant crisis in Europe.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made via google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million will double.
Europe has been facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, torn by a four-year war that only drove 4 million people out this year.
Many people also flee from the war toppled Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery weight loss than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data last long to be displayed," claims Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery uses different methods to reduce stomach pain.
Lowering hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the relation of the weight relative to the height, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate overweight and people above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan have used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastricectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatments in people who were slightly obese.
According to the study, the average BMI among those undergoing surgery declined from 31 to 24,5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent of the patients and only about 2 percent of the patients were fully resolved for comparison of diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," found by the authors.
Researchers also monitored the patient's blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflects the continuous blood sugar level in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, reports researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the treatment group, however, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reached greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3,1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a higher probability of diabetes remission (46.9% versus 16.6%).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studying stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who had a bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chances of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a soothing result for people with BMI below 35, who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," he states, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the drop in patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to show people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that link their bodies firmly to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the near east.
The Tibetan leader of Buddhists has called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech during the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, a study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that, under the current circumstances, the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable as it was, was inadequate for the refugee crisis in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria's efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11's terrorist attack and claims that "the US's violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent journey.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have been ingested by an sanitation agent over the last 4 years
Toxicological centres around the United States reported an increase of almost 400-percent from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years old, which swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the toxicological centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia's Toxicology Centre, the number of ingestions of sanitation agents in children under 12 years of age reported to the poison control centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who must be taken to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink the sanitation device deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
The YouTube videos show teens drinking an ambulance for cheap fuss.
Teenagers reportedly mixed an ambulance with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the medium.
"Children don't think it could hurt them," said Lopez.
A lot more attractive (sanitary devices) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitation agents with a scent of strawberry, grapefruit or oranges are available, which are very tempting for children.
The ambulance contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, a few sips may indicate alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 Station in Kansas City medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital, Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey lie around, either, but people leave these ambulances outside, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six - year - old girl who recently at school ate up to four sips of sanitation agent with a strawberry scent and was taken to the ER for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be a drunken adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah pronounced indistinct words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because a girl fell over alcohol and hit her head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaijah.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended the use of non-alcoholic products to parents and teachers, or to arrange for medical devices to be out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some medical devices were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing an ambulance that contained a toxic, undicted ingredient.
The paramedics believed that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth year students in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by deploying antibacterial products around the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to medical devices and forbids their presence in the room.
The police assessed the failed plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Rumor: No discrepancy in the Celtic team
Griffiths has been racking up rumors about a discrepancy in Celtic while Deila admits that Hoops is in the wrong place, but he's gonna turn it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons up their lead on Celtic by 5 points
The penalty from the first half of ADAMA Rooney's administration secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittrodrie, which gave the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtice.
Griffiths denies talk of non-compliance
This situation has provoked rumors of a discrepancy in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in the preparations for the Dutch League's leadership.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Deficiency in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former backup Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, currently Ambassador of Ajax, states: "The Netherlands no longer shows the best of Celtic matches, and why? "
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the old company's games, and not just the people of Scotland are watching these games.
I'm gonna turn things back to good. He's committed to Deila.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic stumbled a little bit, but the Norwegian boss made a commitment to turn things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent fallout from the Champions League was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has been through bad times and will rise again. "
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about what's happening.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about January reinforcements.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, Head of Rangers Mark Warburton is worried about the great purchase of reinforcements and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
Brentford's former boss states: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window. "
Players who come in the summer have a whole preseason period to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there is more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target suggests retirement
Swansea Michu's attacker, who was associated with Celtic in the transfer window, suggested that he could retire after his contract with Swansea.
The 20-year-old shooter has had problems with his prone ankle for two years and hasn't been able to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1, when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - the third red card issued by Judge Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands up for his claim and states: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance. "
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting that he sang a song with a text aimed at former player Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn region of Edinburgh before Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a heated moment," said the attacker and continues: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in the Celtic jersey."
Council in Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in correcting the situation by the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boy for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCinnes likes to win "ugly victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately hold against Hamilton Accies in order to win the seventh league win in a row and a five-point lead before Celtic on top of the table thanks to the penalty of the first half in Adam Rooney's submission.
McInnes states: "There is no team that won anything, whether cups or league, without winning this type of game. "
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while UK's overall unemployment rises
NON-EMPLOYMENT in Scotland remains unchanged to 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scottish unemployment rate 5.9 percent was above UK (5.5 percent) as shown by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number of workers has now stopped to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the British average of 73.5 percent.
In a commentary on the latest data, David Mundell, a secretary of the state of Scotland, said: "The long - term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy. "
It was almost exactly a year ago that Scotland had made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market, and Scottish employment has increased, while unemployment has fallen.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I'll be watching a man get killed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a browsing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison death chamber and seeing Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who witnessed his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm getting worried.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will be watching the execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visitation.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm just gonna have to memorize all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have phrased it better, " but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could take me off the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist ready to tell a story on the ground.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help with anti-death procedures.
Kim Bellware, Huffington Post journalist, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the podcast series I created.
I'm not gonna repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I'm gonna be watching him die.
I can't say I'm being really objective.
To this end, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die an unnecessary death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after he rescued a man from Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrhu to run away from the police didn't come out after he got into the shallow muddy water just meters from a policeman who tried to talk him into returning to shore.
The Canning Vale police were summoned in an incident beyond Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come get me'," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't exactly want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use safer tactics and that police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
Soccer champion Ben Cousins sets a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the races.
Peeter Moody accused the organizer of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatening to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizer and integrity department of Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratch on Lady Tatai's maintenance day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin's positive cobalt swab, which he cannot explain.
He bit his tongue on espionage charges for 18 months, and he didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it will all come out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.
Previously Moody launched a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
" 18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out about the things that are being done in my stables," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they have completely failed.
Robert Roulston, former RVL Chairman, David Moodie, current Chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a pair of balls and arrange for people outside the coaching position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now will give them material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really made me sad.
I'm gonna push them, and I'm gonna carry a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The levels of frustration of the coach have increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratching has made him feel that he could "have his license on the table for hours."
Mood, the most famous for preparing undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after applying clay or mud to horses' feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for the treatment of the tile on the day of the plant, for which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobra driver who got away was arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram this weekend and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia himself confessed to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains stable in the hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy strikes back rivals for wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' actions as "plan setting" by two NRL favorites of premiership.
Trent Robinson, head coach of Sydney Roosters, said that the referee allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, Coach Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly shrouded note at Strorm after his team won the qualifying finals over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "show" rugby league and according to him two of Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' interventions and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his confidence because his team is being criticized by two leading coaches, which may mean that they are afraid of being defeated by the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," he said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed any of our defensive systems and techniques in the last year, we've just put emphasis on contact during the procedures, and that meant a turnaround for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and apparently he's been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like this always come at this time of year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetov's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that he finds exciting, especially his young backup men with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd like to play if you had this type of player at your disposal.
This view said in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two backups like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about the struggle against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that in Storm and Roosters match more goals fell than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and not scoring experiments interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we'll definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm is taking a break this weekend and they won the right to host either North Queensland Downboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man got $200,000 bail on a drug charge.
A man who faced life imprisonment for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland got $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilograms of solay yacht drugs that arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Comero in August.
Maksimovic was spotted in a meeting with the defendants in the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for possession of cocaine of commercial quality, Lawyer Maksimovice argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop by accident and innocently.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic had escaped.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
He lied to the police about where he lived in the Crown Case.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovice jointly offered a deposit of USD 200,000 for his release.
"After reading both persons' sworn statements, it is clear that the deposit of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their own efforts were obviously inadequate because the accused did not appear further in court, warned.
Maksimovic was given bail on condition that he surrenders both Australian and Serbian passports, will report daily to the police and will comply with curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then applied to her online chat room, where he had a lot of rude photos of children sent to him by another user.
Then the girl woke up and found out she was missing her phone and then found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytic computers found an address and discovered a "disquiet" search on the web using expressions for finding immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was to "lead pedophiles" on the Internet before he "pretended to be a police officer and scared them off."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson said for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer search, but he claims he just wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was questioned about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them
He claims he went crazy drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shivering and crying.
She saw immoral images on her phone, and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of bringing an action for the acceptance or supply of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the terms of bail on 25 January and failed to appear in court on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sex offenders because he can argue that there was no "essential sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October for reporting social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody prior to hearing other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sex offenders before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tainted by the claims of opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats of killing that warned them of Mr Mugabe's beating during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
President of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), Innocent Gones, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is named 'death'," he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and as soon as they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "absolutely" regarding threats against Members.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolishing 25 000 to 30,000 jobs as part of his efforts to restructure and save the cost of business services to the company.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, according to HP's statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will be head of the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of business to help businesses switch to a new business style," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have the company's annual income statement of more than $50 billion and will be "focused on providing unrivalled integrated technological solutions" to companies.
In 1930, the company was founded by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called "Silicon Valley birthplace."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of America's largest technical companies, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialised company has better results.
Captain of the Mikel Arteta Arsenal says the teammates must get behind the wounded Jack Wilsher in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also emphasized to Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next summer European championship is obviously uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury doesn't endanger your career," Wenger claims.
It's a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he had suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he only played in 65 league games of the Arsenal out of 157:
From a broader perspective for the Arsenal it means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two clubs of the Premier League, who lost most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but the Arsenal believes that improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a contest," Wenger claims.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he'll have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begins the campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Artet are likely to get in.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite of the F Group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after maintaining the "invincible" campaign last season.
On Wednesday night, the stadium shook with an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter.
That was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks the Arsenal learned from last season's Champion League, when he surrendered against Monaco, and he has a distant hope of leading the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is immense," Wenger claims.
The Arsenal never happened.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is striking in the eye, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicide among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserally (CALM) marked the year 2015 as the Year of the Man, whose aim is to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of mental problems.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it must be reached first.
In this communication through social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker recently explained, money doesn't really buy better luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this idea to him.
None of the characters was defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all come from knowing that yes, men can also relate to it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."my role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be seen as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He emphasizes little moments in male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come closer, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend organized by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central Station from beginning to end - full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored during his debut in the Champions League and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with the ultimate comfort victory of 2-0 against Malmo at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League, and this PSG player sent the French champions for victory, but then threw away a few chances, until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal head in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and therefore team Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for elimination rounds, but on improving their journey to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of the Laurent Blanca team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal before the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win outside or at home in the Champions League, so winning 2-0 is causing our opponents problems and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve with the season progress," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team, which at home this weekend took a draw of 2-2 with Bordeaux in Liga 1, but was in the fourth minute overshadowed by Di Mario.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who would move the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from Manchester United last month, and showed why, when he ran into the pass Marc Verratti for the defense of Malmo and sent the ball behind Johan Wilanda's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected it to start a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, joined with 9 internacionals in the basic lineup and five defensemen and two drawn backups were a heavy opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjice's shot, which just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with bad passes and a lousy ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimovice, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing a chance for his teammates and it was from his pass when Di Maria sent a spinning shot, which ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan put his head behind the line already the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic passed him the pass from the left wing by Maxwell.
This put an end to all the ideas of Malmo about the possibility that they could benefit from the match, and only Wiland's excellent intervention from a close range thwarted David Luiz's hope and the score remained unchanged even when Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was not recognized at the end of the match.
The team coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place last December."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualification matches aren't enough.
Hat off for Paris.
It was a wonderful match for them.
Glenncore made $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
The mining giant Glenncore, based in Switzerland, who was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, earned on Wednesday $2.5 billion from the sale of shares under his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glenncore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with the rewinding of commodity prices, as China's slowdown in the economy reduces demand and ignites sparks of destruction across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glenncore stock prices to the top of London's stock market in early morning stores on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77% to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glenncore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion share sale was part of a wider plan to reduce their debt of $30 billion that accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares worth 123 pence per share, which marked a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the prolongation of Chinese growth reduced the iron ore price by almost half, and coal, copper, and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on 25 September in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the President visited in November, reported.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife, Peng Liyaan, to a state dinner that will take place after the interview.
"President Xi's visit represents an opportunity to consolidate relations between the US and China and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address the issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber-espionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis swept the Schengen area.
An emergency flare launched by Germany has far not cemented the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote Le Figaro, a French daily.
On Monday, the European Union decided to tackle the refugee problem first: it will be more systematically sorting migrants and asylum seekers as they set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees by quotas on the basis of quantities that are increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, asked 25 out of 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the ministers of the interior of the Member States changed priority.
Rather than caring for the final destination of refugees, it is necessary to filter those arriving today and resolve the fate of those already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for the management of migration," the text discussed by ministers on Monday in Brussels emphasizes.
After the crisis in the common currency, the EU finds it in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases its pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power makes it clear that no free movement in Europe is possible without it.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with different intensity.
Hungary has come to this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and Hungary for those who have already gone inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented hard.
According to unofficial statistics in Italy, two thirds of newcomers have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others, so that there are no camps left on its shoulders where refugees would accumulate on its behalf.
Greece remains the real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as they have arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after going through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil, waiting for a new government, has laid its hands in its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of now common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the inspection points will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has given no number or date.
"The challenges faced by Greece apply to the whole of Europe," the EU Interior Ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore about deploying the intervention teams of the European Frontex Border Control Agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers' reception and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"A reasonable financial resources will be needed," warns the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the emergence of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is close to that.
However, the new emergency situation of the 28 pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which had already been raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year, which Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande strongly supported.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was preserved on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the trial is adjourned.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the hectic EU summit, is concluded by Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, three of which supposedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also the only woman who survived as a disabled eight-member group.
Previous media reports said it was Polka.
About a 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a severe leg injury to the femur area.
The dead, according to AFP, were mostly 40s.
"The rescue was over, the victims' bodies were also transferred to Briancon to be identified," stated the Prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department Pierre Besnard.
The accident happened around noon in the mountain area Pelvoux below the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 metres wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, chief of paramedics.
According to him, an eight - person group of about 1,900 feet [3,900 m] of snow throbbed.
The weather service today did not warn in the area about adverse weather.
Trpišovský before the fight with Braga: Finally, true Europe.
During his premiere in cups, coach Jindřich Trpišovský and footballers Liberec managed to pass the European League for the first time into the basic group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
Slovan will welcome the finalist from 2011 to the main stage of the competition, and according to the coach, he wants to impose his game style on her.
After all the nerves in the elimination battles, when each goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every score, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by just a double fight.
"I am looking forward to this and it is a true Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
He thinks of Bragu as a top team.
It will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be even harder not to have a name like that, but he has a player in his caddy, who I believe scored three goals in Manchester.
"It is an excellent unit at the level of top teams," Trpišovský said.
But he doesn't consider Braga to be a clear favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have also shown in the home competition and in the pre-rounds that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels this season just the opening Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can even force Braz's style.
We've got a team that's gonna be strong on the ball, and it's untypically disciplined for them.
They play from 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field," Trpišovský said.
We studied a lot of opponents in the pre-rounds, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted to training.
"And we definitely want it, although it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," said the coach.
Student films take over Písek, the international festival begins.
This year over 350 authors from 51 countries have entered their works into the competition of the 15th International Festival of Student Films in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which the commission composed of students and educators sent to the finals, will be screened from 15th to 18th October in the cinema Portyč.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said the speaker of the Jakub Charvát festival.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which depends on the festival theme.
It's a detective story this year.
The director of this year's festive evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student works - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, including the winner of the last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers like every year prepare an accompanying program.
Wattian Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turbošanson group Let's fly?, playful band Zříní or Petra Hapková with recital Life on the bar.
The festival will host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first one will be brought by the graduate of the sand film school and the winner of prestigious awards, including the one from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašebrennerová.
The second exhibition will bring the atmosphere that existed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will come to the discussion with the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber and the sandy natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný by his new book by his 3 friends from the town of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences among themselves, and develop joint ties and film crafts," said the speaker.
Pitching forum, where students can meet with film professionals, will certainly help to perform several job auditions at the same time and get a job position.
The festival is connected with the creation of the Private Higher Vocational Film School in Písek.
Its founders, Vladana and Miloň Terč's husbands, organized their first year in 1997.
It was held every two years until the sixth year.
During the bankruptcy of the CK, the insurance companies are required to meet the client's claims in full.
Insurance companies should meet the client's claims in full when the travel agency goes bankrupt.
It was decided on Wednesday by the House when it approved an amended amendment to the Act on the conditions of business in tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee according to the draft that is heading to the Senate.
Insurance companies with an obligation to pay clients' claims even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on adjustment, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to put an end to the insurance of travel agencies against the crash if the amendment pays.
The proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they either have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for YES) pointed out that the cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not eurocomform.
It pointed out this year's decision by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, emphasized Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
He says the bank guarantee won't work because no one's gonna give it unlimited.
"Travel offices will have to end their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousek's concerns based on a survey among the CK members.
"Stop showing us the lobby of insurance companies," he said.
According to Okamura, Okamura does not consider the comments made by the insurance companies to be relevant, there is no official written observations made in this respect.
But they say they're finding out if travel agencies will be involved, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of the Czech Tourist Agency, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about lubricating stairs to Czech travel agencies, warned about the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.
The House did not approve its motion to release the disputed passage.
Nor did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) march with the proposal to return the draft to the committee due to alleged conflict with the Civil Code.
Filip warned about travel agencies that he said could threaten consumers.
The rapporteur for the draft Martina Berdychová (ANO) withdrew her proposal in view of the Constitutional Court's verdict, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that insurance claims would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum four-million-dollar insurance limit for travel agencies offering air travel tours, and a million-dollar limit for offices selling bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 percent of planned sales of tours.
However, the limit on insurance benefits will have to be such that, in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency, it will cover all customer requirements.
Even after adjustments, the standard provides that travel agencies will have to newly state which travel agency organizes the tour for the tours sold.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, inter alia, data on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information on insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with information each month on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for tours sold and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations towards the insurance undertaking, it shall invite it to remedy or prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
The amendment is also intended to adjust the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the mountain service subsidy on the basis of its application, which it will submit by the end of April for the following year.
The request will contain a report on the use of state money last year, a financial plan of expenditure and a view for the next two years.
According to the association, however, the law promoter did not think about what would happen if the insurance company canceled the CK contract.
She won't be able to organize tours, and clients who bought the trip before the insurance was terminated will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer significant losses and may fail even though its management was in good shape.
One way travel agents can cope with such a situation will be to sue for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and then we will act only as agencies on our market, said the Vice-President of the Association Jan Pope.
In his opinion, the draft amendment also contains a bank guarantee, but so unthinkable that it cannot be implemented in practice, because the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in the practice so far is de facto unnecessary.
Within a period of two years, the EU's new directive will need to re-work the entire law.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are now operating on the Czech market.
Only three CKs have ceased their activities this year.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion each year.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to reduce the arrival of refugees in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced this after negotiations with the German Prime Ministers.
At the same time, it again appealed to the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU, among the Member States of the 28th.
We need to help more countries where refugees are leaving, or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will put up with decent conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which higher financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations could be such a signal.
"The Clave countries also support the German Government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis into European countries," Merkel said.
Country Prime Minister Brandenburg Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke also voted to speed up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for the authorities to get started faster with the integration of foreigners, said the Prime Minister of Branibor.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees must also be used to integrate those who have the chance to obtain asylum.
More teachers will be needed to make the refugees speak German.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners can integrate, they can be an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon's playing diversity in the movie.
Matt Damon confronted Afroametic filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's HBO episode, Greenlight was interrupted by an actor in the Brown series, highlighting the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not by casting a show," says Damon.
Shocked, shocked Brown reacted with distrust and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay." when the comments about the Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with a famous producer named Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will treat the character of Harmony," said Brown at the beginning.
The only black character that's a hooker that's being picked up by a white pimp.
The producer of the Dear White People promoted finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off the fact that their director "may eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was aired, social media exploded in dislike with Damon's commentary.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing a video, "Matt Damon jumped into conversation with the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is so white that it hurts. "
Tweet has won over 5000 retweets and 4000 likku since it was published.
Damon's comment comes when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After Michael Brown, a teenager, was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter took national action and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February the singer Prince made innuendo of the movement, while he presented nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the question of personality Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hateful group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," said the manager.
Damon was recently reported to the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has his first winner"
The professional climber and piccolo Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and took home a million dollars.
In the competition, which had just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men fought their way to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb over a 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to climb in the set limit and became the first to compete, which in American Ninja Warrior surpassed the debilitating 4 stretch, however Caldiero surpassed it by full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the news! News right after its hard-earned victory and it was recognized that he was still in shock from winning the main prize worth $1 million.
"It feels amazing, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to my winnings.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's gonna be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed interviewed The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and why Britten won't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the course.
According to the rules, the money belongs to whoever finishes the track the fastest.
"If more contestants participate in the track, the best-time winner will win," said Weed.
Although winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he has a grudge.
He's glad he managed to accomplish what he did.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me, "If there was to be someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will start shooting in spring 2016.
The Tigers of Detroit just walked right past Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For Detroit tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are currently in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just turned away their defeat when they defeated Minessa in Tuesday's game with a close result of 5-4 at Target Field Stadium.
The twins wasted their chance to get close to the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the words to Z which for them during the second half of the season was so elusive.
"Winning is always fun and no matter how," said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took the next in the sixth and ninth shift.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 shots and 3 circulations.
It was his third good game of the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," said Simon.
"It's hard to put yourself in a fight when you're sitting on a bench a lot and that's why I want to get into the game."
Tiger batter Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 circulations and his first downloaded point since mid-August.
For Martinez it was the first three-point match since the last June game in which he hit four times in the match against the Seattle Mariners.
"He's got himself into it," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at practice, hitting a brighter one, and managed to get it into the game."
Thanks to three circulations at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance of getting back into the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won shifts thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Aaron Hicks got a point with the bat set, and Simon struck out with Brian Dozier before Blaine Hardy's left-handed man replaced him.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and he had Miguel San's batsman in front of him, hitting the ball and running two bases and leaving right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two baseball players and a chance to draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send a third baseman over two bases.
Pluffe has already gained 27 circulations over two bases this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit held the ninth inning, Mauer scored two downloaded points, and Bruce Rondon scored a 5-4 for the Tigers.
Anyway, this right-handed guy knocked San out for three pitches.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes' game.
Tigers gained three circulations in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who joined the game after more than a month's pause due to back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift, I felt that I was better at pitching."
After resisting the first inning, Hughes dropped one point to the other, Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for the right fielder J.D. Martinez was brought out by Victor Martinez, who first rounded all bases.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was thrown when he tried to make it to third base.
Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose scored two and, in turn, one point and 3-0 on the final board.
"That's what got us in our knees," said Paul Molitor, the twin manager.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he put him in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up in the third inning with no points and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, got six hits and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right Tigers pitcher, ended the match with pain in the right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007, will take care of him.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of wounded due to stretching muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should be on Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and take up the twins.
Since June 30th, when Norris was replaced with David Price's left pitcher, he's scored 1-1 after 4 games.
Since August 20, however, he has not yet played because of the stretched muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) the Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to a wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping to a group whose task is Tuesday's management reform.
"China should be involved in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," he said about the 16th session of the Central Head of the Group for deepening overall reform.
The promotion of opening up during the birthing reforms will give new impetus and vitality, will also provide new space for economic growth, reports Xi.
The Head Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the liberalisation of border control policy, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The declaration shall state that a negative list shall be drawn up identifying sectors and undertakings which are outside the limits for investment.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will provide the market with a greater role in resource allocation, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, stating the statement.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegate to companies and make sure that the companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In order to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to optimization of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Providing the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
New beds may be created in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
In the region there are also possibilities to extend care.
For example, a surgical department could develop a center of one-day surgery, where, according to the set concept, surgery performances are performed that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals the workplace focused on one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
The skin department of Karlovy Vary hospital could create a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the emergence of an apaolic center that would care for patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, are post-care beds, especially beds Léčeben long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and should mainly closely follow up on emergency beds.
Part of this facility should function as beds rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN beds, recommended concept.
As he points out, post-care beds are mainly missing at Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There you could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, social health beds are absent in the Karlovy Vary Region, focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are in short supply throughout the Republic, so they could also serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's Center.
Hospitals should also be prepared, as recommended, for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds for which European funding will be released.
"These are beds that will follow up on the disciplines of vupe specialist care and will create space for translation of patients after surgery, for example after cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplant or other surgery," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
