Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, combined with 29 percent
The significant weakening of both sides of the current large coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties brought about the early Sunday parliamentary elections in Austria according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molter is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29,8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes against the 2006 final elections.
Even worse, ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these big parties in Austrian postwar history, and especially for the folks who called for early elections, literally a disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when ÖVP resigned from the coalition, the folks had a considerable lead in their preferences over the SPÖ.
But the voters evidently punished them for letting the government fail.
Speculation about the possible resignation of the party leader and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molter was already expressed in the initial responses to the results.
Observers consider that this could happen on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party's Bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the increasingly likely exit from the electoral outcome, i.e. the restoration of a large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) received 18 percent in advance, and BZÖ received 11 percent of the votes - but the Social Democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999 when the People's Party agreed with populists (then FPÖ was united, in 2005 it split off from BZÖ) to a common government, which even triggered sanctions by the European Union.
Haider is clearly betting on this development, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna for national policy.
The Green Party also made it to Parliament, but it was easily lost and fell to third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties clearly exceeded the four percent threshold and did not make it to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of illegal beetle collecting in India could not be solved, Karel Schwarzenberg's Czech Foreign Minister said that Czech-Indian relations would be cooled.
The minister said so in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji.
"If this had not been resolved, yes, then there would have been a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on the Czech initiative.
After the hearing, Mukherji said that powerful power could be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he stated that, in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of charges and punished by a fine, the central government could deal with the local government in Dárjiling whose jurisdiction the case falls within.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukherji to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself at the hearing.
"Recommends appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicted party, said the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help was already provided by the Indian party.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the Czech News Agency said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister avoided the answers to the question of whether he had been given the Indian side's promise to deal with things.
"I have been given quite enough promises," he said only.
Czech judge the fight for the sea floor
It shall proceed to a wall-based electronic map showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent sea floor.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a 30-member team of personnel of the United Nations Division on Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and sometimes completes it.
There's work spirit and enthusiasm.
The bottom of the sea hides the still little known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores, and other minerals can be found here, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key, for example, to developing a cure for cancer.
The bottom is bigger than the land
Today, coastal states have begun to apply vehemently for new underwater territories.
According to the UN Convention, they use their rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it is exclusively entitled to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"Simplically speaking, the continental shelf is the part of the sea bed and its basement, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the border of the coastal sea, often beyond the limit of 200 nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone" explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf shall be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical dossier based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The world's response has recently been recorded by Australia's success, which was the first to substantially expand its underwater grips.
But he also acquired New Zealand - the surface area of the sea bed that the commission gave him last week - is about 1.6 million kilometers square, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits that they will have in the future from using the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other States will submit their requests gradually.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the " Montego Bay Convention."
Where the continental shelf ends, the region of the ocean floor, declared "the common heritage of mankind, " begins.
No state has an exclusive status here.
The right of mining in this area is granted by the Convention established by an international institution.
"But there is no Klondajk at sea bottom," says Director Mikulk at an exaggeration, saying that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined"."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the sea floor now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
It was acquired in 1991 under the Convention, as well as by investors of several other states, the status of the so-called "piper investor."
He is authorized to mine in the Clarion Clipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian islands and Kiribati.
The investor surveyed the area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, it's a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be extracted on an area with a total area of 75,000 kilometers square.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic contacts containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian worker of the division Rober Sandev brings one such concretion.
He reminds of a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a fabulous shem who, according to legend, revived Golem.
The German special deployment units were at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government requested assistance from Germany - experts - when dealing with the hostage crisis.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were prepared, but the deployment did not occur.
Other details of the circumstances of the 11 liberation in Egypt of European hijacked tourists are gradually being brought to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, the special forces of Germany were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the ministries, both the experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of German police GSG9, squadrons of the Federal Police, Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were on the spot of liberation.
However, according to another communication by the two ministers from Monday afternoon, there was no need for German forces because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
According to the Egyptian Government, the aid offered by Germany was accepted as a support force for action on the spot.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said one of the spokespersons of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19, in the south of Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages were moved in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the liberation or possible payment of the ransom.
They are now safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the liberation of the hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of his release.
There is no information yet available in Berlin when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" all five tourists should fly off with special forces one of the Airbus German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of US Congress left a $700 billion bailout for the financial markets to fall to a tight majority.
The Dow Jones index just fell through.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and both sides' leading politicians, most have not been found for a programme that should alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
Dramatic action was desperate to convince critics of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on the Member to give his consent before voting, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
The reason was investor concerns that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose, so that after the announcement of the crash, it would fall steeply again.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the consent of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents are recording the increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, travel bookings for the next month increased significantly by more than 30 percent compared to the previous year - even during the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the appetite of the Germans remains intact.
For winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Survey Institute, even for autumn months, increased reservations are already available.
Thus, according to DRV's statement for October, turnover was about 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results are the GfK numbers, which evaluates reservations from 1200 German travel agencies every month and interpolates them to the overall market.
Reservations of tours were included in this result, which took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak rate of the dollar, it is mainly requested to travel to the US, said the DRV.
For these trips, the increase in reservations is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable targets for the Germans.
First of all organized tours are on course, declared the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising expenditure on energy and food, the cost of "for the client is easier to calculate than for individually organized vacations'.
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was said to be very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
An endlessly repeated beer, beer from tuplaks and prominent in costumes from famous designers.
First time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, TV host, and she wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we haven't even three minutes on a beer meadow yet, and photographers are throwing themselves at us, and memory cards are agile - that flatters me, for my first time on Oktoberfest.
That's how you can make friends.
Looks like my cheap costume has done its job.
I'm here as a tourist, and I live north of the sausage equator, so my comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwies, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's costume or leather pants; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Only my apron reaps strange views at the banana stand in chocolate.
A Munichian warns me that I did not tie her well: "You are free on the left, in the middle of a virgin, married on the right, widowed on the back. "
I'm gonna sneak the bow from behind to the left.
"Okay," he says, and laughs.
Others do not care so much about subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats with the words "To drunk to get dressed!" and stick out on passers-by naked butts.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous" with an extended "oh."
That's what he tells me after he's relieved himself of his just-drinked bacon.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks they're garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the dreaded Wildbieslers, as they say in Bavaria in public for free peeing people.
Others are not lucky to get rid of this kind of alcohol.
Around 8:00 p.m., they run around the area where Oktoberfest takes place, a bunch of paramedics who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors beer meadows: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarp of this coffin of mercy is not visible.
"The soy that can't go on," one of the paramedics will call me in response to my question and disappear into the crowd.
Police have released the name of the victim of the accident
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson from the local Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, Europe's powers longed to penetrate deep into the Turkish lockdown.
On the east bank of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in Neo-Renaissance style.
Well, that's what the tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits circumstantially at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the facade, looking to the indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the vaulted cash register, you can no longer doubt the size of the business whose most western gate the station was.
The station in August 1908 was opened by the German consortium Anatoly-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, which became involved in the game of empires lately, intended to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East using this railroad, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their dorms were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular units.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by frozen Cold War borders, is gone
British and colonial forces advanced from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news also came for Hydarpasha Station.
In 1917, the bombing of the ammunition train destroyed her sophisticated roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually crumbling and history has been circling it.
But today, this gateway to Anatoly and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Party Justice and Development - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding areas, created by frozen Cold War borders, is gone.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is getting involved.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to Ankara's Turkish capital, where I was to meet one of the leading AKP experts on foreign policy, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride along the tracks, which reminded the old-world rhythms of the famous Night Post document, I arrived in a Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Otomanian past.
However, the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
She raised suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main tent of AKP, an ultramodern stone and metal building, deliberately built in the developing suburbs, surrounded by half-built business houses and handle shops to power, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to do early morning business.
Suat Kiniciloglu could easily be a central-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry, too.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its lockdown.
Today, they must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But surely the moment will come," I asked, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "it did not wish for such a decision to take place."
Then he emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to said almost by heart: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are equally for the benefit of Europe and the United States as well as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go east to Asia and the Middle East on these tracks.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of the two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Cona who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now be, for the most part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the port for the ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a guildford musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district musical plan, he founded a year for this excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was to be up to 21 years old, but by the time Proteus sang his last song in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to embark on any music that was presented to him - whether madrigally or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
Musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often astounding, always exciting and all thanks to the inspiration of the only man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself"?
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it! "
His baton technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he conducted Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "took one or two soaked stones around the world"
Many of us will be missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff's notes by the author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff crossed that part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the Jose Vicente Resina exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was attracted by the simplicity and powerful charge with which the viewers were affected, and by consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda strikes with his bestseller for the second time
In the month of November Honda will launch the sale of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single space vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers even more spacious interiors.
This is joined by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this single-space vehicle.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period than other producers to rejuvenate this model.
Although Jazz is a less famous model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
It has been in Japan that nearly a million pieces have been sold since Honda Jazz was launched.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims to increase new Jazz sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 pieces of Honda Jazz, in 2009 the estimates count 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, which means 6.7% of the total Honda sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation of Jazz is concerned, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units a year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will enable Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The company's management thus de facto expects the end of the year with a total number of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of his next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid of a compact size with a length of 4.37 metres from which Japan's company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 units a year.
As far as markets are concerned, according to Japanese producer estimates, 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be divided between the old continent and Japan.
Honda Insight sales are expected to start in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased all dimensions.
Its length increased up to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and axlebase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
Enlargement of dimensions also increased internal space.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Jazz Honda.
Also, the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - has increased to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of the luggage compartment in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with the engine 1.4, as the volume of the luggage compartment for Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement besides external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of a glassed panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the angle of opening 80 degrees versus 67 for the first model of Jazz.
In the second generation of Honda Jazz, there are new engines.
In the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time as high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine shall have a power of 90 hp at 6000 rpm at a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of Jazz - has a 5.3 litre consumption and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, the current engine will reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"Car Bee" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan inspired the development of technology to protect against accidents in nature, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes on the pattern of flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robotics developed the prestigious Japanese Tokyo University in cooperation with the Centre for Advancement in Scientific and Technology Research.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of public relations for technology, research and brand development, BR23C is presented as an extension of four zones of the security shield Nissan.
The robot's task is to strengthen the ability to prevent collision in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
Most important, however, are composite bee eyes that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles located up to two metres in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"At the moment the obstacle is noted, the robot mimics the bee movements and immediately changes the direction by turning the wheels to a right or even larger angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are absolutely instinctive.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction which is allowed by turning its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as for bees.
Nissan therefore also used the rotating function in addition to acceleration and deceleration to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and it will be maintained according to these data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can function without interruption with only two dozen kB memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't talk about the giga or the mega in memory."
This is the first step in developing new technologies for immediate prevention of precipitation, a technology for which Nissan predicts use in serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the finish and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy your fear before you take a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury, apart from having enough capital to give out injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages from banks with dubious solvency, it created a popular-leaving game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or "Hotel of Bad Credits" or a misguided hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look bleak so that once, twice and three times you can think about whether it's the right time to apply for a loan.
And especially where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than for the entire public.
And what happens when the game is over?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, 'cause I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley is opening up his MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley Bank House announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to raise 21% of its capital, was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's current shares at a single price of $25.25, which represents a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG Bank invests another $6 billion in obtaining convertible securities that will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average uniform price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock still lost 6,79% and got to $23.07 around 17.00 greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a bank holding," explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to enable him to disperse his activities, but it also places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest aces to take a more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan merely announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, in Tokyo, "that our participation would consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to limit the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley's securities 7% less than its book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the share profit by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange price, i.e. roughly $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the group spokesperson refused to provide specific information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After an investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15% of Tier One's solvency ratio, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan stated that since the end of August he has reduced his balance sheet "sensibly."
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group, because its exchange rate has fallen by half, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have increased sharply.
On Monday, these costs took on opposite developments, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" from Wall Street's large investment banks, announced after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establish a republic around the Socialism of the XXIst century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointed person submitted a proposal for a new Constitution for voting, following the model of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished because 64% of the electorate, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
To accept the draft Constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit of the polling rooms and the calculation of the NGO predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, with them between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, after all, demanded the victory of his draft Constitution from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil governorship, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received a congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the Organization of States of America (OEA), took place calmly, covered the text on 444 points building "a new socialism" promoted by the President.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over economics by reserving it with the "development planning" of a country living primarily from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The Correa-sponsored proposal, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution strengthens the principle of free health care and education, which the President began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it envisages a ban on foreign troops, thereby ending the agreement between Washington and Quite on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
19 hostages were liberated in Chad
The Egyptian commando took the attack of 11 tourists and their eight-man escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were brought alive and well into the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, an Egyptian commando was liberated in Chad.
Hostages arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft to the military base of al-Maza, closely adjacent to the International Airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transported without being able to express themselves in the press, aboard a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the peripheral residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers" declared Egypt's minister of tourism Zoheir Garrana on the runway of the airport.
Since its capture on September 19, during the safari in a four-wheeled vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hideout to the other by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of Aegyptous agency, organizer of safari.
A leader of Egyptian security forces suggested that 30 members of special forces who approached the site on board two helicopters set off on the trail during the night just before dawn.
"There was a gunfight, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of Egyptian special forces from the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is currently located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, from special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that a ransom would be paid.
On the eve of the Sudan army, she reported that she had detained a four-wheel drive vehicle on patrol, on which the hijackers were on board, six of them killed, including the Chadian commander, and two of them arrested.
The military claimed that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - Silent majority of the resort culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of the newspaper with inch headlines and is the topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to pillage poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national memorable places that starve to death?
What politician dares remind the federal government that they're ignoring their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government spends three and a half million euros to restore the mere Chronon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it says in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organisations, in cooperation.
In Quebek, a federation of companies for Quebek's history, at least 40,000 volunteers are working together in 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy to spread history, preserve a pile of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments that are driven by hopeless protests when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we finally gonna see the bleachers for history and monuments?
Benelux Government of the State Part of Fortis
The Benelux States will help the Belgian-Holland Bank of Fortis, which was the first to get into trouble in Europe because of the widespread effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partially nationalisation: three countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has capital participation in Hungary, with a sum of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition, have agreed on this at the highest level this weekend.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to have been in a major crisis in the international financial markets, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made in this case could be considered precedents from a certain point of view.
In the sense of the decision that was born on Sunday night, all three states will redeem almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets there.
The bank will sell with absolute certainty part of its equity holdings, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis' shares started to fall sharply last week, and by the second half of the week there were already serious signs of a crisis in the constitution.
But analysts agree that with their 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it fail.
The company's securities fell by 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year minimum.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's total market capital value is around €14 billion, but according to the company's leaders, it is unrealistic.
Moreover, the management blames the collapse of Fortis shares in the overseas market for the adoption of a $700 billion US package plan.
By Monday, the stock has risen slightly.
On Friday the new CEO Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer no one has yet claimed.
The Belgian Government has previously announced that investors need not worry, they will not lose their money.
There hasn't been a panic among the bank's clients, and branches haven't been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also purchased several leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with a candidate based on people's drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme which binds the use of drug prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the henhouse to the fox," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
Insurance companies shall make insurance premiums and the amounts paid in the event of claims dependent on the health of candidates and, if the risk is assessed as too large, they shall neither close the insurance with them.
Previously, they sent the person concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number of the customer from the pharmacies, he easily finds out what medications the person has bought in the past year and a half, from which the program itself produces the disease and its health.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering drugs, it refers to having virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts him in a higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of them also determine the risk coefficient, so there is almost no work left for the insurance company except paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
The drawbacks are that many medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are useful against migraines or hot flashes, but are also effective against depression.
These constitute a significant risk-enhancing factor for commercial insurance companies, whereas the first mentioned difficulties do not.
In order to request and process data, special companies were created to request the patient's permission before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacy.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so, even though they have not been punished for their negligence so far.
Some companies have recently been working on the results of laboratory tests, which connect with data on the medicines used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, while controlling their use will become increasingly difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to providers of health services and insurance companies.
The draft law, which gives the authorities the power to control companies specialising in data provision, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his programme in such a way that the transfer of data is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that he can hardly deny the permission in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are somewhat dependent on the fox's good will after all.
The Global Marseilles Menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are mutual leading business partners, this topic was dominated by other, mostly global problems, by the agenda for the ninth summit at the highest level.
There will also be a French-Indian summit today, which will primarily involve cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak into international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at yesterday's ninth summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as current President of the Union, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double trade turnover within five years, or increase to more than EUR 100 billion.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were legally aligned to this sign, so air transport was also green in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - both parties condemned it in all its forms and called for an accelerated UN conference.
They also concluded the Doha round of trade negotiations, although both have a major share in its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as would the fact that at the next year's climate conference it would be necessary to conclude a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent rising food prices and support the call for an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister will arrive in the French capital, where he plans to conclude a trade in the peaceful use of nuclear energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will receive a mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Great participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international Frankfurt book fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171.790 square metres of fairs with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) - at 264 square metres of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a meeting with the press at Room Structure Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives as regards the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is still decreasing in relation to total Italian production, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while crossing the desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the Mammoth Lakes region of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aeroplane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, scattered the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying in on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff thus stated that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Security Agency (NTSb) announced that a team was sent several hours after the wreckage recognition, which finally identified the plane: Bellance 8kcab, missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Service, cash money and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of alone flight.
Three years later, the world flew around the plane without landing.
Among his many records are also flights at a height of 15.445 meters above the Andes, although with a copilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" Jeeps of the House of the Star, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a vortex of news into this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional processing will be unexpected and unconventional communication, which will accompany the launch of Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign accompanying the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the automobile brand.
The project of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan's business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will feel that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be enlightened at various moments in all its little things, so that it will then fold again into a single painting.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of automotive communication.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
Now we know who Italian hooligans are.
Trivenet, they're risking Daspa.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the Ultras Italia group, which has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years and which has never, in fact, caused excessive problems.
She's never even met an opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
Founders come from Trivenet.
Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campanie and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags showing cities of origin involved: they were removed on Saturday night in order not to be identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc gave Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in name, i.e. easy to control.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with Dasle going on, no one who would be forbidden to visit stadiums.
Four blue fans who had prior offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and no match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Dasp for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riot.
International Daspo, which forbids visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will never set foot in one stadium again.
To luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means that more than 150 will be added to them.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not justify those who behave in this way" is confirmed by Viminal.
So, "right eyes open, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday at Lec"?
There's a small core of backers in Puglia right now.
Tomorrow Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday, Casms, who can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
"Congregation Leader-Führer and Stretch Arm during the Mameli Anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a very little happy way) who is the director of the Viminal Osservatorium for a few weeks (captured a place that was previously Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Quaestor in Trieste, where the core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that it is not a crime in Bulgaria to celebrate leaders, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds Osservator's number one - crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far, this group has remained within the limits, now let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
However, let us also discuss the whistling of Mameli's anthem: it is not even a crime, but if you will allow it, it is rudeness..."
