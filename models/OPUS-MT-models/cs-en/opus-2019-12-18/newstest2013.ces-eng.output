Republican party strategy against Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
However, Brennan's Center calls such fraud a myth, with election fraud being less frequent in the US than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states are responsible in the US for organising federal elections.
And in this spirit, most American governments have been declaring new laws since 2009, which make the process of election or registration difficult.
This phenomenon saw a boom after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were added.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were submitted only in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the periods for elections in advance, nullify the right to sign up on the electoral list on the day of the elections and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State required the voters to present a photo ID document.
The first State to introduce this request was Indiana.
The US Supreme Court confirmed the constitution of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this procedure to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states to force voters to present identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, they do not own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age who are able to vote, no ID issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, he does not have such identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the purchase of the required identity card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young, minority and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age therefore do not have the required identity card with photos.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters by their inclination to democratic candidates are not entitled in several states to use their identity card with photographs issued by their schools.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer Republican candidates to use cards issued by these clubs during elections.
By 2004, no state required proof of citizenship in elections.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at reducing the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
Republican legislation in 2011 supported in eight states laws abolishing electoral registration on the day of the elections.
Moreover, they have reduced the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, the electoral campaign helped register some 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican legislators then adopted laws in the next five states aimed at shortening the term for elections in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, the African-Americans accounted for 33% of the voters who voted in advance, even though the African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They formed only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, the white people, who represented 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the approval of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
They managed to reduce the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card.
However, the new rules introduced will make the exercise of the right to vote completely difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics are primarily talking about the bias of approved laws and consider them to be a clear attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Brennan Centre shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral body necessary for the victory in the presidential elections.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Discovering prostate cancer: undergo examination or not?
The PSA test has sometimes produced false results that have been incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, resulting in unnecessary medical procedures.
All this increased the hesitancy of men who were already so reluctant to be examined at all.
Get examined or not?
We've asked for two experts' opinion.
Studies conducted in the USA showed a high level of contamination between the tested groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, noted a different mortality rate between patients who had been tested and those who had not been treated.
This study also demonstrated, after 12 years of distance, that those who fail the test have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
So I recommend a 50-year-old or 40-year-old examination if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
The more menacing group are also African-American men.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are indifferent.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the extent of the hazard of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to cure prostate cancer that has no impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active control of the disease.
Today, a number of men diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their kind of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Rather, we will propose active supervision and, in the event of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
More and more often and with greater precision, we set criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment and which one does not.
However, I recommend you pass the examination.
However, it is important to conduct an interview with a doctor and to determine whether or not it is advisable to have an examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, Movember created a tool that allows evaluation of pro and anti in connection with PSA's examination.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research, it seems to be the best means of reducing the risks of disease by adopting healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided if everyone ate healthy food and moved well enough.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian cancer research company.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes heredity.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for the Canadian cancer research society, although the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely damaging to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," André Beaulieu, the spokesman, shakes his head.
Encouragement: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer deaths decreases by half.
Weight
According to the SCC, the body and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout his life," the report adds.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, colorectal cancer can lead to an increased risk.
It is appropriate to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet brought clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are inconsistent according to the SCC.
Although one of them says there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks rather of an increase in prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated either.
Mr Beaulieu continues to insist on the importance of discussing his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Submitting examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs boson examined
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate disturbance last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by a standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto are more likely to confirm it, but all data are still missing so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, suppose it's the Higgs boson, because the risks of error appear to be small, and let's see what it is.
In this world, there is a completely indisputable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be avoided - and do not try too hard, or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that there is a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find decent citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow Pauli's principle.
And at the other end, there are bosons, mean anarchists who don't appreciate anything - certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The article Adventure, in Berkeley labs: mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and "power particles" by which great natural forces spread and with which Higgs' boson is probably related in some way.
It must be said, however, that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light " that is the "carryer " of electromagnetic force.
When particles with an electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they "disrupt" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbing" will result in an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "power bearers."
More stable field
It's also with the Higgs boson, except that "disturb" requires a different field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; very high energy values need to be achieved to excite it, as with the frozen surface of the pond, only a very large boulder will begin to eat.
For this reason it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as an accelerator in the laboratory CERN - a large hadron accelerator with friendly bundles is a circle with a circuit of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to us to clarify the relationship between Higgs and mass.
All particles and all materials are not responding to the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the fridge.
And yet, with the Higgs field, all the particles do not respond: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as photon, let's look at it) do not.
And Mrs Nováková wonders what all these researches are for, what will they bring us?
From a scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between observation and predictions of SM.
Moreover, few physicists literally want to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, it does not provide any clarification of gravity (whoa!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of space matter (whoa again!).
However, CERN has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Responses
The responses to these researches in Mr and Mrs Novak's everyday life can be very difficult to predict, but the mistake would be to think that there would be none.
Behold: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers did not have a laser in Bell's labs, nor did they have any idea of the revolution that would trigger their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said this - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the lab".
Just imagine...
Moreover, application can result from all the tools that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle initially did not plan this at all, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and awarded him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that you never really know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... © Le Devoir
Through his Dignity Dying Commission, Quebek has recently been involved in delicate questions about the end of his life.
The debate should continue shortly, while the bill is being drafted.
There is still much work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to take a closer look at this question.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him gave him a two - year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," he says, without emotions on his bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the bathroom alone or just eat himself.
He's resignedly looking at a delicious-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, brings him medicine, offer a bath.
Courage for an ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confesses.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In all life, one learns that men pee standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Going back to the baby's stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person" whether he accepts the return, claims the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people dealing with palliative care, the crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients entering a home with palliative care of Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is three months tops.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs A., 89 years old, it is the worst fear to die "in full consciousness."
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no more wishes in my life," she says, and then she will allow us to put her breathing device on.
Yet he is still looking forward to his son's last visit from Italy in the days to come.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers provides body care with the help of nutrition.
This is the palliative care that comes in if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec there is one bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all gonna die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi can be provided according to taste.
Diabetes may no longer guard their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
They were carrying Mr. X's beer last night, who later died last night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, days go one by one, but they don't resemble each other.
In addition to a 37 - year - old man who rejoices in the last encounter with his family thoroughly grounded on pillows while toasting him in his honor, a tragically 36 - year - old man surrounded by his parents, his wife, and two young children dies after trying out all the possibilities to survive.
"There are always three to five beds for people with cancer up to 45 years of age for six months," explains Dr. Christiane Martelová.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with Access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to alleviate suffering as soon as the sick reach the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize in more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this crucial lack of access to medical care in Quebec that many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of the euthanasia law and assisted suicide.
Since October, there has been a manifesto in circulation signed by peaks in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure access for all persons to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in enormous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
They are concerned that patients should not be asked to be killed because they do not receive appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
The hope of Hélène Richard's survival was quite minimal when she left her demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die thank their attendings for not fulfilling their wishes when the team of palliative cunts eased their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care in the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal area, patients resist pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either shockingly or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who will not be relieved of pain will increasingly have access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not sedated always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to take away my pain."
The implementation of this report enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, construction entrepreneurs and public works, political party lobbyists and Italian mob experts are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters mix.
This "branch" came very expensive to Quebec taxpayers especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has crumbled since we took major action," says the ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
Thanks to him, there was a scandal in 2011 based on a rigorous investigation aimed at embezzlement of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved after long delays.
The "Duchesneau report' confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque financing of the parties and corruption of civil servants.
"From the start of the 2010 investigation," says the Department of Transport, "only saved a billion dollars in contracts," when some people kept their instincts in check to get a share in them!
Charbonneau's commission "has already brought two mayors to the demise, " adds with the hope that it will be able to "discover the cunning of some people. "
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption established in 2011
The permanent corruption-fighting unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, police officers of the "Marteau Group" who have since 2009 ensured that Montreal's "money bank" greatly mitigates the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a number of inspections and charged with fraud and corruption with a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb town.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He's suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The formal accusations were also received by transport engineers from Montreal and by Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
Lino Zambia caused a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
During these years he himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he acquired in Montréal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambia was generous to all parties after 2000 and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money lines whose prices were higher than those
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very actively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in detail before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to tours, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money lines for which he overpaid the price.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had paid their wages for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-work.
Martin Dumont, the mayor of the mayor's party, then accused Tremblay of turning a blind eye to the parallel budget that brought dirty money into his cash register.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, putting Montréal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, she has advocated the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and sold to... 1.6 million promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of money in election campaigns
Regarding the investigation that will finally be initiated, he says that "he pulls strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system of a watered ant to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
According to her, the process is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to establish our own investigation unit in Montréal and ensure that these dubious practices cannot be reversed.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars, " but he is particularly concerned about the role of "members informed of this deceit " if they have not been involved in these scams!
He estimates that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and he adds with irony: "I have heard that it is only a weak decoy of reality. "
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to $100 to parties, but it does not solve the situation: "Until there is a strict reduction in electoral spending, the money from politics will not disappear. "
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public procurement and financing to parties: "We can no longer fall; if we courageously focus on the substance of things, we can rebuild on stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance with the laws. "
If this story blackened the painting of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all who mock him to look at his own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You and PSG have set a whole new pace this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day, I get on with them.
The tech team helped me a lot too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier to fight.
Everything's going really fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in prep school in INF Clairefontaine to transfer to Saint-Etienne, I've always shifted by individual degrees.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
Backup from this summer is used to playing matches on a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makele, who used to play in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he does not have equals in the first league and he is one of the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's got a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a soothing conversation with him.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you view the first part of the PSG season?
In the first league, Lyon took our front position.
But we're staying behind.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have advanced very easily to the eight-finals.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away from here as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a heavy opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group before Port first, so we can play in the rematch of the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to implement this plan.
And would it be a great failure not to win the first league like last season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We've been missing a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had the power to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think we're gonna make it this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are looking for the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect much from us, given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is, if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home, and there's still something in the papers that they're saying, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what more people can ask of you.
Of course, you can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the League of Masters, we have proven that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't fought for the eight-finals in the second season, and they've invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you'd be expected to have a 15-point lead in front of the others!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not do very well last season, have moved the new PSG to the next stage.
That shows how amazing the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and think that despite all the difficulties we have succeeded in winning.
It seems that PSG relies on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovich in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's a "dependence on Goldman."
That means Ibrahimovich is very powerful and he scores a lot.
That's why he came here to prove he's the star of the first league.
Everywhere he passed, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
On our team, we respect both man and player.
Even he respects the people he has around him.
What he has accomplished is truly extraordinary.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defensemen in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with French representation?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've been there, and I've come out stronger.
Today I also play good matches in the representation.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves a debt to make our appearance exemplary.
How do you view Didier Deschamps' first months as head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We're in a good place at MS qualification.
Coach picks strictly, he's close to the players and he's excited about winning.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved its goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) from October 16th in Spain a solid starting match?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a struggle in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true in these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euro...), and secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows file exchange between partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers involved in the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as means of payment.
The bitcoin course first reached a maximum of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $2; today it moves to the limit of about $10 (the course overview is shown on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's not impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin calls it "the most successful virtual money," "the competing dollar and the euro" and "the form of ordinary money."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for a video game that one can gain by playing or buy (and sometimes exchange back).
Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all network nodes are the depositary of a book of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The file of information relating to this transaction is electronically signed by the double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the eligibility of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that replaced bitcoins exist in the public book of current accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It takes place by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is a phase of file cutting, i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then "chop up" the whole.
The aim is to find a number that provides a specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then displayed indestructibly linked to the string of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user wanted to pay twice the same money in a row (within ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different fingerprint.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided into a hundred millionths, so the margin area here is...
The difficulty of the task is also increased with an increasing level of calculation.
The network has seen its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stolen by stored bitcoins.
"The used loophole does not concern the protocol itself," Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, assures the real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls money laundering options through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, as a platform for WordPress blogs, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins are not around.
"Great discounts " were launched in November.
"$30,000 has been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to turn bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the teaching book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but he uses a Bitcoin system to verify transactions that make it cheaper.
In addition, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up with traders where no new terminals or software need to be installed.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, Pierre Noizat states that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and to move towards more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin gets through, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages a re-evaluation of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in Afghanistan's countryside, which we punished, suffered the greatest damage because we thought they were terrorists.
And so have we, for we have lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Now they are experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of French troops from Nijrab's foundation, which I watched from the peaks of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, was done in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without assault on a helicopter's air escort.
Since the end of 2014, Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed considerably since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty, and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkening of these peasants, which was completely dominated by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state land, which they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaign, people want a government that won't make thieves.
A number of youths want to leave the way those who have been able to take advantage of America's generosity want to leave: capital flight is considerable.
The young are tired of war and associated ideologies.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world and were intrigued by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25; there are currently 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given work, they no longer want to return to the darkening of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish TV shows the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in her forehead be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation along the lines of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so that the premiership, which has existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964, has been abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and early years.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam works, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
A private initiative has priority.
In a country destroyed by three decades of wars, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
And that just fueled the feeling that the Western states were only here to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without resources to transport raw materials across the mountains, no extraction of minerals can take place.
The Chinese almost left Mes Aynak copper mine and left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) an opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist complex to preserve the role of the most important employer throughout the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large proportion of imports and exports depend, will also need to resume normal relations.
The departure of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys' lyceos, Departments of French Universitys, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "get a heart and soul" has worked to try hard to reconcile aid and military activities, in which the Ministry of Defence (Cimic)'s "civil-military action" service, which was abolished in 2012, but has achieved many achievements in the area of common interest and agricultural reconstruction in dozens of mountain villages thanks to the innumerable French NGO.
These works, involving a number of local workers, helped to dampen up the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the cultivated area.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2 000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, they claim that they want to achieve a minor civic aid for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and touched directly.
Difficult work in the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Morsi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the declaration of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, he decided to play the Vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of everyone else, that the Constitutional Assembly will approve the final text the day after tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave the meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, which weakens the country's constitutional stability and leads to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's divisions.
From the opposition's point of view, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," continues to "break his word" and" trample on justice."
However, its supporters assure that this is a means of making the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should take place in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the Egyptian text's purpose to clarify the article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is rejecting protests.
As he confirmed in an interview for the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people ahead of the ultimatum: "You will either approve my text, or I will retain unlimited powers" which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday 85 Members of the aforementioned Constitutional Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most liberals were absent from the vote.
In the middle of November, not long before the constitution was announced, they blew up the door, not having the opportunity to assert their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their step.
In order to reach a quorum, 11 replacements were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles of the Constitution have often been voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to pause over the fact that one of the few disputes revolved around... a prayer hour that day, when some members of the committee held that the hours in the conference room were not properly adjusted.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law'.
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term 'the principle' with the term 'rules', which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
" Hypocrisy," the liberals argue, who only see it as a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
In particular, they focus on Article 220, which entrusts the University of al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular on matters relating to the control of the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to an expert on Egypt, Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "persons called to comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The beginnings of theocracy can be seen in this."
The concern of liberals is even more fueled by the fact that the next university rector should be less moderate than the current one.
"There has not yet been any particular religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulama, but university workers, many of whom have studied in French schools," Alexis Blouet's moderate concern, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because in it the terms used belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, notes red.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on it".
In addition to the religious pages, the text approved yesterday is very critical of the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, civil proceedings will not be prohibited in military courts, as requested by the Human Rights Association.
These associations speak of their doubts in relation to the text which they believe is against freedom.
The criminal act of blasphemy is preserved and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to perform in a television address last night, there are scheduled demonstrations for this afternoon.
The leaders of the state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel there are holy places, the belly of the world and the sea from saturated salt solution waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The promised earth combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and nature's pristineness.
AaF identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bow to Holy Places
To visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God's mercy will descend upon all who enter this "bath. "
And Galilee - instead of Jesus ' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming down the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here will walk through the Path of Pain, or Jesus Cross Way (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio - Pretoria - where judgment took place, passes the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's Grave on Mount Golgotha - the place of crucifixion, the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian belly of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which they made the cross for Jesus ' crucifixion grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews - the wall of lamentations, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different religions leave notes with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Make your way through the vertical
The ruins of Masada Fortress remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
The ruin is located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who engage in climbing can get to it with their own strength.
The others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m there is a famous ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the foothills of the hill.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit everyone on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (the Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition are his screens widely represented impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which presents to visitors several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of spa users and spa caregivers from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the unique private museum Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenirs.
Admission fee is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in - and you find yourself in total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa centers of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, delfinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can also swim in the winter months because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
The dead sea is, by the way, the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest land point on the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily maintains on the surface even people who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using saltwater - brine, and medicinal mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure your nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous maritime road connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The mention of this city is found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they shared a long and happy life.
Indeed, tourists love wandering in narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press against the walls of your "sign " alley, happiness will favor you.
In the Jaffa, you may encounter newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarea - King Herod's city - you can walk through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully renovated theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word.
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now $1 is approximately 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city to the upper.
It's basically an underground cable car.
Traveling through all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, which can be moved 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it stops working in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get kosher meals: except pork, seafood, fish without scales and meals, which contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various kinds of sauces, ground chickpeas balls - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of the cities of Israel.
But there are very many fat cats that are graciously "wanted according to their taste. "
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Predatory cats love crowded places, and they like to go into every goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine have come to know the country and rest.
The promised country was visited from January to October 2012 by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" announces it to Moscow: emigrants save money on their tongue
While MEPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language testing, frauds have already appeared in the country selling "false" certificates.
Every year 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December the law entered into force, according to which each working migrant will be obliged to pass the test of the knowledge of Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the SMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend a work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
This law is not even subject to people who have successfully achieved certification and obtained an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia.
Members of the State Duma and the FRS (Federal Migration Services) also supported the initiative to promote testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the question in the press many times: what will it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and the visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration service respond - this will allow the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labor" to be reduced.
Today, many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explained by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Russia in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise with unemployed immigrants, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev with conviction - the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide "a voucher" to horrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others like him will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive, they cheat them, seize their passports, do not pay the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Main Tajik Administration of Labour Migration MS Tolib Šaripov.
Don't swear!
The less so that many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who intend to go to Russia for work acknowledge that they not only know the language of the country they want to get into but have no experience even with the work.
Of course, it is not as much their fault as it is a misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to obtain at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, worn and equipped for school.
As children grow up to be productive, they have to go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language it is difficult - admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, in view of the law on language testing, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even pass the exams or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally as they did in Russia.
"Welcome, or no unauthorized entry"
Many of the incoming workers claim that obtaining official status in our country is not easy.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police employees know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - he shared his experience with journalists by a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be mean, buy a painting"
On the first day of validity of the Language Act, it was found that fake documents are not only for migrants to register.
SMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the language examination.
Falsified documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they didn't get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants in the hope of facilitating the problem of passing the tests paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times the amount of the official test: it's going to cost three thousand rubles for migrant workers.
The main task of the nearest future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, in which both government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, the government can promise foreign workers who failed the tests for the first time the time needed to take a course of basic Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealings with people are not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not release illegal arms market into circulation
The proportion of criminal offences with the use of legally held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia is presenting a proposal for tightening the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is a reaction of government authorities to recent events: the incentive was the shootings at weddings that went without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow's attorney Dmitri Vinogradov, who resulted in seven deaths.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption of Irina Jarovaja, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by means of "pulling screws."
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - require the rejection of the "insense tightening up" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasili Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms offences were committed in six months 2012 by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand offences were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the legislation on civil weapons will not force the perpetrator to move to the "black" market.
According to their words, any weapon at a low price can currently be found in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says the colonel retired Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the departments of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot sites that accept orders of weapons
The first - "army or military journey" means a weapon that was stolen during fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and caucasians themselves," says Baraněc.
Another type of "black weapons" is weapons stolen by criminals in the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement employees.
Illegal "mainly" are being sold from military warehouses.
There are often explosions in many military warehouses.
"Some fires have been established deliberately - to cover up the manka," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, weapons manufacturers also make their contribution.
"At present, private arms firms that are not competitive on the international market are being created and they are eliminating the weapons they supply on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of guns and automatons come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in small-scale production, and a mafia was created that organized their continuous production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up the approximate share of individual sources of illegal arms supply to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Designing of Public Administration.
Specialists discussed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, reported by researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "by officials whose work is related to weapons, " says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons are from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases involve theft of weapons in their production, 5% being "black archaeology."
A salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores who asked us not to mention his name is convinced that weapons found in excavations by black "archeologists" are no longer bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, salesmen go to military warehouses for new shipments.
Through the Ensign, the interested party buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he'll sell it over the fence.
"He will take her to town and then sell her for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever a plan starts to burn in the light of criminal offences, they will carry out checks on illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"Like a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their known ones.
I visited websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Experiment" platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the "petition" where we would negotiate with each other.
The most important thing I've learned is the price up there.
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, tells the salesman - a consultant.- I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him fully.
Sellers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that my daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I'm gonna get there through a guy I'm sure of.
He'll only deliver them to me because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he processed the paper on this topic.
Schematics didn't change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album that said "everything you thought."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to the words of Baraněc, does not offer a rabbit in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, I just don't buy - we go to the woods with the seller and we build a target.
"They will give me the opportunity to shoot, and if I am convinced that the gun is firing well, we are beginning to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa container
Search engines will bring you on the Internet to websites and groups on "Vcontact" where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes."
No documents or personal meetings are needed for this.
"Just have a set amount of money," says the ad title on the website "Buy a Fighting Pistol or Automaton."
On this website, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the letter is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moskva" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently blew up a vast network of planted websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can scrape a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military dignitary Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The Buyer will make the payment through the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions on where the gun is hidden," says the spokesperson of the NGO Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When you buy an illegal gun, it's estimated that experts will pay a sum usually from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO, "Gun Rights" you will purchase a $100 to $300 Makarov pistol.
You have to wait a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from warehouses for long-term storage through storage facilities of a medium article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7% compared to January - October 2011 and amounted to 22.9,000 cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers are on strike
Working at the "McDonald" office till a quarter of all American teenagers pass
In recent days, America has raised a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of the ninth, or whether it is destined to vanish soon.
The whole share is supported by trade unions and a number of leftist social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries received by ordinary workers in Walmart and in fast food systems, protest organizers aim to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually intact by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday" when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, captured millions of inhabitants and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, who work at 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and leftist activists of multinational companies of commercial chains, whose goods are intended for people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage employees in Walmart stores only shop at work.
The availability and range of goods have made the Walmart chain one of America's largest companies.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply partly because they pay little of their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or hand-held scanners.
Demonstrators called for an increase in salaries on the "black Friday " and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't match the cost level, says the staff.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises an average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is an average of 1.1% more than this company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart moves wage increases fully to the shoulders of consumers, every visit in the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend approximately $12.39 more than today.
Walmart's defense attorneys point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and that society should not cause virtually any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight on the following day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, its cashiers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "black Friday."
In an interview for Huffington Post's left-wing website, a representative of Dan Fogelman said that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that protest was all "another media sensation" organized by the trade unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not the Walmart department stores (the ones in the advanced city mentioned are not very popular and therefore almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick leave, and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaan Williams, a city council member in New York City
At present, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal laws and New York State regulations.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their regulars in New York receive $8.90 an hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after part-time school and live with their parents will go through "McDonald."
Few people see this as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I am constantly meeting with "McDonald" workers who complain that they must live off this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
At 6:30 a.m., protesters started on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast food businesses begin to receive at least $15 an hour, which is more than double their current minimum wage.
They also requested that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
American laws prohibit administration from preventing the establishment of trade unions and punishing union activists by bullying and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is also difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food businesses for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high fluctuations of employees.
Disagree
On this day there were also noisy protests in many other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of this event was at noon a meeting at "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, especially a member of the Jumaane Williams City Council, who said: "McDonald" says that he sells billions of portions, and then does not pay you sick leave and does not pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor's candidate for Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must come forward together to support fast food workers so as to achieve the fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described in the New York Times, it was the greatest event of its kind in the history of the American Rapid Refreshment Area.
But only a few hundred people attended, although by far not all of them were employees of fast food that employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event becomes a spark that ignites the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far the brain has been deceiving on average"
Among the fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular theme of expanded reality; recently it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, Google presented the work model of this novelty at its annual conference, and in November it was announced that Microsoft also applied for the patent.
An interview with the head of the interactive 3D technology group in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi shows that glasses are already a thing of the past for the scientists of this company.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in general what your research group is dealing with?
- We deal with human interaction with machines, but at the same time we're trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, mostly touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all there is a very interesting possibility of control using gestures.
- What else can we do in the future?
- Regardless of the fact that Kinect has transferred interaction to physical level, very many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow has not yet improved separately.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
You need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Surely it cannot be regarded as a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because we do not always want to inform others about our activities and intentions in our neighborhood.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling equipment in public places, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not about swaggers, just those swaggery, short ones.
At the same time, the gesture would not be taken by a camera device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to get the user to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at any given moment?
That's not necessary at all, but it's bonding.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
This can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or anything else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can bounce off in our three-dimensional recognition work.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's the matrices and the depth.
At present, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the velocity, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me at work, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful, I just don't need so many touch-ups, but I need some extra shots per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras isn't necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, play with the curve of camera location and see how it helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think that it is one of the most promising platforms when it comes to the daily use of advanced reality technology using special glasses?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding a smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful option would be the "transferable" form of expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones at any time from cloud platform to projection screen and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in this is their strength (private things see only you), and at the same time weakness - the expanded reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man" but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands can't feel anything!
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that widespread reality - that's the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - using the other hand as a kind of background for displaying.
Excellent way to record compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibleity to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of several directional ultrasound rays at the defined point where the finger is located, triggers a tactile feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you were blowing on your tummy fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects nerve endings in the fingers - also promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
So he thinks he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here comes another challenge, which will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically located in a very cramped space to believe that they are walking through an open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (not at all as in clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a goal, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes virtual reality work so attractive for researchers - many things are in the beginnings.
tasteful instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the "Petrohrad avant-garde" project dedicated to the people who are in charge is an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were important figures of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without reaching universal fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who's all dressed up in red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, the one at the Summer Garden, the one at the fashion pubs and the openings.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they're exposed, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of Petersburg, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - he is a striking man of the Petersburg avant-garde late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets makes people smile, it makes everyone feel better.
He recently took the flamet and became a Saint Petersburgian flametographer because he has matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town all red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I chose a red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and the public.
Although, in general, everything that is a little different from grey is arousing aggression and awakening bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists crossed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonenevian, who led us to "Pushkinsky 10," and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to the theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the word.
- And it all merged in your art-clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of Peterburg culture, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I took the post at Pushkinsky 10, and before the reconstruction there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of Petersburg's bohemian bohemians.
Many were born there:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how they brought Snura with the project "Ucho Van Gogh."
Snur and his friends sang under the plywood of a light song, dressed in tight jerseys, among them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programs of Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, which started his big career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137," club "Gribojedov - this is the reverend of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and permanent guests left off.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture still meant something.
In 2000 the survey was organized in the press, the special prize was "People in our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year," I was appointed, and that was the end of my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and penetratingness are captured.
I'm gonna have a program show called "The Russian Clown Museum."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, it's painful and awful to be like that today.
But in clowns, everything gets wiped off, tragic.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the order.
Today, people meet by clothing, orientate themselves to external mechanics, not inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We've seen you recently as a town organist. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who would be if I wasn't?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are falling apart.
People used to meet in the crowds, and the bohemians loved one, the simple other people.
Today everything broke into a micro-companion, today it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
You need to think about who you're gonna like tonight.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators are coming to Stas Mikhail's!
- It's where the fans come in. It's where the sexually social sphere gets involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural grounds, and 10,000 people don't come, and the result is less management, money, everything is fading.
I've got fans, the main thing is that nobody fools them and breaks what's in the past.
When I was young, I painted pictures that were hanging from a collector on the wall along with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say, spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no consumer culture, it's from somewhere else.
I am a man of culture yesterday, and I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money to draw paintings.
And I'm all for that culture.
Cyril, what's the shortage in Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is such a concept: an actress through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
During the time of the proper Tsar, it was not so in everything, the Tsar may not have understood culture very much, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
With us in St Petersburg we have people who could be experts, but they are tucked in somewhere in the corner, because they need great experts who properly appreciate these experts and will guide them on the right path.
Today, tasteful thrives.
The same Erarta, but they differ by honestly saying that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburg is?
- Peterburg - it's not the capital of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right ground.
And art thrives miserably on our decline.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers here today than there are readers, which is wrong.
There are many people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to shows, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable business, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented for St.Peterburg grant
To give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of spaceships with Earthmen on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in weightless conditions or on a given substitute planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars," says the senior scientist of the State Astronomical Institute P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus they reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It's only possible to live there at high altitude or in orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists with flora began to address the questions of reproduction in space.
A half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was delivered to orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check on the development of an embryo in a weightless state.
We're getting an absolutely normal bird at the exit.
But then trouble starts.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find support, it must stand on its own feet and begin to move," says the head of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't find support, the birds fall chaoticly and make a wiggle.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds have completely lost their instincts.
Birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was they just died in four days.
"Twice we had birds hatched, but then we rejected it because it is simply impossible to work with them there," comments Vladimir Syčev, the failure of an experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
But in biosatellite "Bion," there will only be one-sex beings.
There was an experiment with rats that were being broadcast into space already gravitational.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts must be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground, the cosmic rats were born offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction in the universe has not yet been reached.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instincts when they lose their usual environment.
Human, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not performed.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The Téreshkovs were in greatest danger.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Tea flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would last a flight to space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," says Veteran of the Vachtang Vašnadze missile-space sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after a flight into space, Valentina Tereshkova's first female cosmonaut gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son of the second wife-cosmonaut Svetlana Savická was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in an open universe.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts born after long years and growing healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbital years," states the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia Valeri Poljakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new ways in terms of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, cosmonauts are learning the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable, but in a way a strange environment, it is a natural element for young children.
Little ichtians seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the child being on average 9 months in his mother's amniotic water and that it is easier for them to adjust to water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the time of the first bath, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little to make a child forget anything," says Marina Aksenova, a new-born swimming instructor.
In short, if a weightless condition is more natural for a newborn baby, then the inevitable gravity, an attractive force, is more natural for women.
In a weightless state, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, drop the ability of the body to drive the fetus out.
We can leave that aside if muscle activity stimulators work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's body expelles the fetus.
"And what next?" asks Valeri Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If Earth's attraction doesn't affect the organism, it can't properly form a skeleton or a muscle system.
Newborns in orbit cannot be dressed as adults in a special suit with a load in which to train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs to develop.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," the head of the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Bioethics Commission predicts.
So the birth of children in space is just a theoretical question today.
One day, however, a time will come when the earthlings will become a reality and set out in their ships on a faraway planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
The head of the SAO: Švarcsystem has failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it is limping in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think is missing," Kala comments.
Similar conclusions also suggest a joint inspection of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, he cites Peter Nečas' approach to the so-called "shvarcsystem."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with their controls - is it forbidden or permitted?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it forbids anything, the Prime Minister can't stop the office from working, which has a duty to control and enforce obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, where legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement, followed by national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all of this together, and although the control is not yet over, we have seen very interesting differences - in general, legislation may be "more strict and perfect" in our country, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to continue to create more precise rules, but it is necessary to pursue the application of the law itself.
What exactly can this project do for you, what does it mean for you?
Such a joint control could help us to stop making efforts to refine the laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price in order to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal behaviour.
But by reducing the limit of contracts, we don't necessarily have to achieve that.
Maybe the system's gonna be flooded with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in that system are gonna be more easily drawn from it than if the limit were to remain higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office here similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, like the SAO, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, is only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed in a similar way.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has these accounting courts at the level of individual Länder - in this the system is a little different from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds managed by regions and municipalities are controlled there from the level of federal accounting courts.
As far as the legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better at everything.
So is it necessary that they have better controllers?
I certainly don't, but I say again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it has to be said that even the countries that we consider to be a role model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
With regard to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean to your Office, do its implications appear in any way?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet shown in our monitoring actions.
Because we're doing ex post checks, there's a certain delay to be expected.
We are only watching this so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new "risk of inefficiency" tool, through which we have driven almost 14,000 public contracts through, and we have analyzed them - there will of course be changes, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
Therefore, do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
A problem that may occur here, that she will "strengthen" the rules and will not be able to follow them.
Already under previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it worth tightening up the law in this way?
I don't think that's the way.
The system must exclude those who want to assault and abuse him, not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will only put greater pressure on bureaucracy.
Then how do we get out of it?
Let's see where the road doesn't go.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs by checking the so-called "shvarcsystem" - and what does that mean?
The Švarcsystem is forbidden or permitted?
The law must be set up somehow, and if it forbids anything, the Prime Minister can't stop the office from working, which has a duty to control and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We're gonna change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're gonna act like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are relatively strict rules on how what is to be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the best bidder is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what I think is missing from us.
The roads are sometimes frozen, but mostly mobile
In several places of the Czech Republic the roads are frozen and snowy.
Most of the time, though, the roads are mobile, somewhere with caution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary Region this morning the roads were mobile, but sometimes frozen and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but should be slightly warmer during the day.
Snowfall in the region has ceased and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there are about 30 centimeters of snow.
Places were also less visibility due to the fog, resulting from the data of the dispatch of regional roadmen.
Speedways R6 and first-class communications are now mobile in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is appropriate, for example, on some bridges where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also mobile.
However, in some sections there are still remains of frozen snow and some of the snow.
Especially in higher positions, attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of icing, in higher positions and on the mountains there can be a layer of snow on roads, informs on its website the Road and Motorway Directorate.
Road drivers warn drivers about frost, it can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysoké Mýta, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is mainly on roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlické Mountains.
The snowy layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia it is most often clear to some extent without precipitation.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Plzeň Region are mobile this morning, but with high caution and the ride needs to be adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures are between three and nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication may thus be frozen.
The driver must count on fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It's based on information from the circuit roadmen's dispatch.
The D5 motorway is almost free of restrictions, but caution is advised by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
But in southern Plzeň and Tachovsk there may be frozen sections.
The communication of the second and third classes is damp and in this case also the warning of frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent roads in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc Region
The snow mash on the road must be expected today by drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region.
After chemical spraying, she remained on the Červenohorské saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videlský cross.
The roadmen were driven into the terrain by snow at night, in Šumpersko according to road managers they snowed about three centimeters.
In the other parts of the region the roads are mostly mobile without restrictions.
"In Šumpersk lies in the highest position remains of snow.
The drivers must count on snow mash on the Červenohorské saddle in the direction of Jeseník," the Šumper Road Administration dispatcher told ČTK today.
Their colleagues set out in the field at night on Jesenick, the roads and the highest positions are now, according to them, after chemical treatment bare and wet.
On Olomouck there are roads that are free of restrictions, but in Sternberg drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the roads remain wet.
Ústecký kraj, Liberecký kraj
Several difficult to ride places are reported by road drivers in the north of Bohemia this morning.
In addition to several places with snow attack or iceberg, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústecko is closed.
Temperatures are also held in lower positions below zero, so the ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Central Bohemian Mountains, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
Operational complications are not yet reported.
The iceberg is reported especially by roadmen from the Štětí area.
According to meteorologists, at night the conditions were ideal for her - rain and melting snow during the day, bright and frost at night.
From the main moves are reported adverse conditions on the road I/13 on the border of Ústecký and Liberec region.
The shutter from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent branches of trees that bended under the snow to the road.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we people like to catch on to.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make more fun of it, and we say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also organize an absolutely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a nationwide fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the Mayan end calendar announced at 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before 20 December from 21 pm will take place simultaneously 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to consider, together with the public, the state in which this world will be passed on to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world called "the end of the world."
Is she very popular on YouTube today, will she also be at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in a complete conclusion, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't come...
It will be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
Hymns are also connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the video played by Tomáš Hanák, sings in it also Xindl X...
How did you come to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of fundraisers and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
Turns out most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What are the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world?
To the equipment of the wheelchair-free educational centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in Jedličkovův Institute.
Students of the Jedlička Institute regularly run out of lecturers and engage in activities that entertain and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go as teachers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
As part of the construction of Jedličko's Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, into which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We've been trying to put together a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic actions" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are already in the USA, would like to connect it to a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these paths logistically and organizedly?
It's not as bad as it looks at first sight.
We have five members in an electric cart, her carts must travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we carry with us a large number of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, ČSA and British Airways have been excellently prepared for us, that I have wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how individual differences differ in barrier-freeness, public access to handicapped people and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than us, we have seen in Russia that everything is still in the beginnings in the east.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move alone in the city center.
It doesn't even apply for granted, like you prefer wheelchairs in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
On the other hand, how do we still have to catch up with more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In both London and Madrid, it is common for people with severe disabilities to move in public, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in which we are a bit ahead of The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-freeness is one thing, but only when we become prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things really change.
So far, these are rare cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years ago what made you start it in 1998?
I started as a tutor at the Jedlicka Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play a saxophone, among other things, so my colleague and I set up an interest music club.
And over time, as our host Láďa Angelovich says, things have gotten a little out of hand.
But popularity hasn't come in years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped when we began to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We realized that work that wasn't visible, basically as if it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is crowded with things where one mimics the other.
It is logical in its own way, everything new is accepted carefully and takes a long time.
Things that are rare are very few, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression in a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But the regret is completely useless, because people with disabilities aren't suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just for them, it's for the whole company.
Did being a strict boss, as many people have marked you, also help this success?
When we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising in many matters and require discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic image and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, enthusiasm leaves them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, there's no stopping that.
Whoever has the will and taste always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 o'clock
It will run in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fleda and Ostrava with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will join the telemoste in singing the song of The Tap Tap "The End of the World canceled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multi-functional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at the Jedličkovův Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free tickets at the Bohemiaticket presale
Poland and cosmos.
Last week Poland was accepted as a 20th member of this European space agency as a second country from countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years thereafter participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I will mention a lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entrance to Astronautism.
The ideas of a young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award for Entrance to Cosmic Science in France.
The recalled Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautism.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautics and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925 a rolling dressine was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to start the dressage or to brake it.
Information about this dressine is only known from the period print.
From 1933 with missile missiles began to occupy the Polish artillery.
The research was provided by Komórka Techniki Urmaenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustawe Mokrzyckiegi.
From preserved materials, it is clear that research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, the arrival of German troops was interrupted by research.
In 1937 a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket was made in professional print by engineer Rohoziński and in the following year the work of Rakiet - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza by Leliwa-Krzywoblocký was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of military use of rocket technology were addressed by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity its activities ended the start of the war.
Further work on cosmonautism appears in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of Polish astronaut society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a reference to the company in the November edition of the 1954 issue of Problemy, in which there are four more extensive articles devoted to astronautism.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowice, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautism.
By that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has tried to join the International Astronaut Federation (founded 1951) and already in autumn, PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first Chairman of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronaut Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of a very successful weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later an improved version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledov desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should have been able to really scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have reached 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, further developments were suspended in 1962.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965 became the successor of the first RM rocket.
The rocket was designed as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed which differed in size of space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was a 0.4 litre space, a 0.34 litre meteor-1B and a 0.62 litre Meteor-1C.
Maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket development took place at the Aerospace Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to carry out a useful load of 10 kg up to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later are still to be mentioned.
Poland was also involved in space research in the Intercosmos programme on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works.
The resolution raised a lively discussion in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, nothing unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the considerable differences in labour prices, the price tension (strength) occurs.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer tries to compete with imports of cheap goods by "undermining' the competitor's price in order to bring down a larger market share and thereby increasing its own profits.
On a mass scale, it means either translating production abroad or buying or disappearing cheaply for most entrepreneurs.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for the unemployment generated by it, the social expenditure of the state is growing.
The whole situation is enhanced by the total unwillingness of business owners to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social social damage that they have done in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that no specific statistical data need to be provided.
In individual economies, reckless private capital practices create a situation where national governments are forced to enter into competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to their own population regardless of the social downturn.
This is reflected primarily in the changes to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept a price dictation of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This is both a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and a restriction on workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with an increase in differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food outlets for poor people for many years who cannot feed on their own work.
The number of these people is already going into millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are very common cases where properly employed people receive such a wage that the state must pay them to the existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity of virtually all the southern states of the EU is undoubtedly leading to the same situation where people are forced to either emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in the social level as it was in the 19th century, or to live on starvation wages on the outskirts of society in the hope that private investment capital might come to the country someday.
But here it is necessary to ask where it will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan or Egyptian are still working for a fraction of Europe's wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state cannot participate in its own economy in capitalism, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists on the opinion that the State must not intervene in the economy through management intervention.
Then it must be asked whether private capital does not affect, now it actually governs politics and thus the whole state in its own self-esteem.
Here's the definite answer, yes.
The evidence is the existence of virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, lawmaking, where virtually everything is criminal but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is that the state ministries for lack of funds award drafts of laws to private law firms that are densely related to industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western-type constitutions say, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracy is now quickly in a situation as described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disintegration, and the authorities have occupied themselves with violence.
For bribes, illegal gain of favor, and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant without any inhibitions, and the people went to the polls with a previously sold voice" ..."the characteristic people did not apply for office at all, so one day as a result of this disruption was the state without consuls"..."It was indeed started to talk about the fact that the only cure in a bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man." Appianos thought of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who changed to a democracy to self-government.
Conclusion As in the antiquity, the current company is based on the ruthless preference of its own benefit regardless of the social interest.
Private capital, by its very nature, is no longer able to understand and apply the social benefits.
The result is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform deeper.
Therefore, we must look for the causality of the onset of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At present, the demise of these systems in favour of liberal-type democracy can be regarded as a sort of break with the expectation of the next round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of deaths, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure of competition both at international and intra-European level, the government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms, which will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing comes out of violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza's belt, as always, a lot of reactions have arisen.
One is behind Israel, they argue its right to self-defense, and Palestinians play the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racist state of Israel, the genocide committed on Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fits the role of terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the recurring waves of killing and who victims, after all, today's people of Israel, including self-governing territories, are born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
My point is to offer readers a view behind the curtain, a view of who is primarily served by 95 years of stress (counted from Balfour's Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the historical facts available, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who virtually which group of people is the main driver of modern history events.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of struggle for power.
In every era, we can track down some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were completely autonomously directing their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who was directing their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not occur in the life of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one, which could be considered the head of an octopus (if anyone is still standing above them I do not know, but I do not rule it out) - Rothschields.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
The first printing agency (Reuters) was bought in the 19th century to stop linking their name with highly criminal acts in which they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the world's central banks and countries where central bank shares do not have to be waged or fought (it was 7 countries before Afghanistan was attacked, five countries after Iraq was attacked, only four were left after Gaddafi was overthrown, but in the meantime Russia was subject to the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank of Rothschield's Bank of America, began to issue his own (know government) money during the Civil War and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the FED, was murdered 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power in 1859 - 1871 led to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war was designed to remove large monarchist states in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule especially the Great Britain, and the third was to lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is sufficient and do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prelude for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of wealthiest families led by Rothschielda works is to initiate a crisis and subsequently offer a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crises like those that were created in 1907) do not recur.
So after they managed to assassinate Habsburg's successor, R-U to the throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, to start World War I, they destroyed Tsar Russia by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended in a sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (no longer needed war for the destruction of Tsar Russia) and then the break-up of Central European power, Austria Hungary.
To facilitate the start of World War II, bankers allowed politicians to create a latently conflicting situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating a presumption of radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then just slipping them the Germans sufficiently strong, culprits indicating and simple solutions offering the Fuhrer and further creating a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also playing, the fifth column function, when starting a war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschielda encouraged the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
Balfour's declaration has already created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first conflicts with the local Arab population have begun.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler fell off the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or everything he did in the plan is difficult to estimate, however, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created a prerequisite for accepting the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations of Germany, World War II, a third outbreak of war was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, like the other, will now be victims in the front line of the fighting, together with the Arab or generally Muslim Middle East population.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also on an international scale (let's just take on how sharply people are divided into supporters and opposers of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice produces injustice in an endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power stood at the beginning of everything?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers only plant their own candidates on people's choices.
The current prime minister of Israel, the Hawk of Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascinating, international bankers loyal, a policy that does everything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to grow into a global conflict and to control Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, which travels 20% of all world oil (the cruise corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
What light does David Rockefeller now have in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order. "
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every new born individual is implanted at birth by a chip that makes it a completely controlled being.
"And he compels all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, that they may have brands on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the numeral of its name.
This must be understood: who has the sense to add up the numbers of the beast.
That number marks a man, and it's the number six hundred sixty-six."
Movie Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah of Muhammad Réz Páhlaví, who after the revolution fled to the US, who have been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive basis - the Shah could not afford to be thrown overboard because it would fundamentally jeopardise trust with allies in other countries.
But in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was unable to achieve the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco's attempt to free the hostages by force.
Inmates were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
In Iran, Debakl contributed significantly to the loss of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by Ben Affleck Argo describes an episode of the history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was filled, six employees fled.
After complex peripetia, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped with an extravagant cover story - they went to Canada's passports as members of the film crew, who was in the country looking at locations for the filming of a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert on "exfiltrating" Tony Mendez also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, there were press conferences, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been classified for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, at the same time called "caper movie," the story of a successful piece, a betrayal - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film, moods take turns - on one side, documented sequences from Tehran (in the subtitle sequence iconic contemporary photos of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film are shown - there are no big differences).
On the other hand lightened passages from Hollywood, negotiated with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck's career rebooted in a remarkable way.
He became a respected director of a ridiculous actor, and even his acting stopped being the subject of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that elevated the director's older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is also showing it in Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and inquisitiveness that occur when history moves somewhere out of the blue.
Affleck and his co-workers achieve similar effects in stage fiction (false crew on Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that the story doesn't actually offer much in the movie sense of exciting scenes.
He's been working very successfully with it, sometimes he thinks something about reality - everything doesn't work out so elegantly there (the scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport turns away the call in America and the runway chase seems far too far-fetched).
But the weakness of Argo is the tension resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the role of Hollywood co-workers, but their characters deserve more space and they're far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film kind of loses its dramatic pull, it is a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciate the realization and retro style of the evoking thrillery of the 1970s.
But it's not gonna tear it down.
As a reminder of one way of living history so far, as well as proof of the exaggeration of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, it will suffice.
Rules for balloon inflating, bananas and circus
The server www.bank's fees.com, which annually announces a survey for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop."
"It led us to this last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the poll.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court to unify the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have benefited from life insurance because they are objectively less risky to insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulation also includes mandatory incorporation of biofuels into fuel, which is detrimental to nature, and a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances or a directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Critics were also faced with a factual ban on the use of butter spreads or the elimination of classic light bulbs from sales.
Quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimeters
The Union's apparatus often decides under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic is now also a threat of theorem promoting the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to be at least 14 cm in length in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomaly curvature'.
In doing so, the European Commission has defended itself by merely harmonising the existing ununited national standards that have complicated trade.
Despite the resistance of some states, EU standards on fruit and vegetables have softened with reference to the fact that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation may also be a candidate for victory in the poll, according to which it must be mandatory for sold inflatable balloons to notify them that children under the age of 8 must not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed here to American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of death of children to suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14.
Curious ideas are born at home
Quite absurd is also the rule concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has an official office in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must speak instead of it about the FIROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire nominated for the survey in addition to some of the above absurdities, the Union regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food stocks that could have been in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
Survey organisers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea of granting subsidies on request for a subsidy.
However, these ideas were not created in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said former Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument he argued that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of so-called intervention purchases it should have become full of warehouses which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic's continued port.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, administered by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically to write a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily targeted in the Member States, EU regulation efforts and, at the same time, more effective functioning and development of the whole Union deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, drawing EU subsidies on projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have forced Member States in budgetary negotiations.
Emotions among the Czechs also arouse the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, and it will not always succeed in this match.
After a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs defended the marking of Olomouc shapes, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed homemade by our producers.
Only cane distillate products and not sugar beet products may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered EU products in the company of world-famous feta cheese and gorgonzola, marzipan from the German Ljubljana or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary crackers, mountain and cherry carp and zatec hops have already found themselves in the company.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and fire pipes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If it works in our country without any problems, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer see the country robbing for the last 20 years, the thieves running around, people getting more taxes and retirement.
I shouldn't have been an ambitious politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I was forty years old and I'm an independent non-patriot, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but soon you set off for Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle based on the result of the Senate election.
I later stated that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, the function is a tool how I can realize my visions.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest possible mandate.
However, the problem is not only that as a nation we curse at the tavern and television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
This will be accompanied by media that degenerate a person and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to be bribing journalists or being an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
In the fight for the Castle you set off with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the return of property confessions over twenty million.
You have to change the law to do that.
But as president, you don't have that kind of authority, and only the Senate as a whole can design laws.
How are you going to handle this?
As a citizen, when I lobbied for free trade to be a guide, it succeeded in asserting itself.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, they deliberately reject it, and it delays citizens.
As an independent non-scoring party, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My priority is that without party labeling and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more right-wing or left-wing?
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people put me to the left.
It doesn't matter to me whether a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose the wrong idea.
You go to hell when someone says you're a populist.
But you're not proving it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about already work in the world, or important experts have spoken about them.
But without Parliament's support, all you have is passwords.
And you can't handle that in the long run in politics.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to impose criminal and material responsibility, for example?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push for it.
If I was elected President, there is no problem to organise a live television broadcast, where I will ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to impose material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
If he is a strong person who will name the bad guys, he can push the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, that was the credit of public pressure.
Frankly, I'm an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I have only just begun in politics and will try to get majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things on my own if I can't, I'll be done in six years, and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, which is why I've been around a lot of famous people to see if they'd also run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So, at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenc, who was spreading scams with light fuel oils.
I've been running for people to be really unhappy, but now I'm on the fence.
Sixty percent of the people didn't go to the polls, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have elected the Senate to make it difficult to promote change.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or captains.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to look into every potential sidekick's clean past, and I don't even have the money.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign. There's only $20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land worth about 25 million, a ten million apartment, another eight million apartment, a collection of artworks for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant to women and fought against bad things and bad things.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million worth of property, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
Am I gonna get in debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program may not be so interested.
And I have no obligation to pay for my campaign.
The campaign costs will basically cover what I'm going to get from the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't make it out of him, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd shut down these activities?
But that has nothing to do with the amount of salary.
As promised, I've reduced my activities partially.
For example, the travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live off of something.
How much were you used to taking a month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'll take from here.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You'll find the whole interview on Saturday's Law.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not take place only in the head - such as Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"This building seems to me to be cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, means, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I wonder what else we need a library for today.
They all have Internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-fashioned libraries are volunteering anymore, are they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own jobs, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councilmen realized that there was only one way to become statistics masters: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely bold bar graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with normal tranquility and appeared at the competition meeting in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still looking staggeringly around and shrugging its shoulders, the cheeky Maas was raising his presents to himself by the size and his activistly justified speech ended with the words "Dear Town!"
So this is my proposal for the Mount of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a mountain worth 30 million euros was raised.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an extremely ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, makes it richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of its existence.
Long way to the book
First impression: reading Eldorado under the cheese hatch.
While the lift runs through the massif of the mountain, you will discover real spatial and readative passions when you walk to topography.
From all sides the glass interior is bright and neat, the floor of the burned convertible and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally stands shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly uncool and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the reader's space out from the inside.
The interior of the Mountains of Books is handyly used: on Wednesday there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and control room of home technology.
The black shelves for books, which are one lining of walls, one sill and other times by railing the stairs, are a special delight.
The appearance, structure, and smell are foreign.
Even the architects and construction engineers swore their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the magazine Standard.
So one day, we stumbled upon an appropriate agricultural waste product in a French farm.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimetre fleece made of synthetic matter has been used as a foundation under the roots.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
Thin textiles last one, two seasons, and then it's ripe for throwing away bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in this amount - was pressed into boards of four centimeters thick.
By causing heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and weighty material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 stairs, you get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 metres long journey you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but especially the correct humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a demonstration project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
It's heating up and cooling off the earth's heat.
Although the mountain of books stands under the glass hatch, the sun shines only briefly in the sunny days.
The wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glassed facade, serve as a shield and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can handle fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg "the long awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: each city dweller was invited a few weeks ago to open a book from his personal fund.
This should first fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently accounts for 70,000 pieces.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, everyone now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
The MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated she is.
That's the starting point for identity after all.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in deciding on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Szaboa is balancing Berlin on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first indicated at the beginning of the week that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
But now Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think they're gonna support America's position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, of course, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in setting up a no-fly zone.
It was finally pushed through by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, in the direction of the US-led policy, so to speak, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still settling in, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, as they do in France or the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It shows the readiness to take positions that are independent of US or European partners in the event of national interests.
I think German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests have an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public but the elites in Arab countries.
Anyway, that's a big deal.
But I wouldn't want to attribute too much importance to it, it's not exactly a one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany's relations with the US been damaged when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great deal of understanding for the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as it was on Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This signals that they must be considered as international players and their interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the US has made itself clear to the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of America's internal policy.
I think that Obama's government may have a very strong understanding of the European position in secret.
But as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, be held publicly.
I think that differences in opinion really aren't as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama isn't very happy about Netanyahu's politics at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it hard for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not happening.
Thus, they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead move things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even because of its relationship with Israel.
That's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is Germany's leading role still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a larger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany takes a greater role, anti-German sentiments arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all kinds of neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The US's influence in European politics is now constantly falling, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Target Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a designation that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it uses protection as long as the actual brand owners do not sue them.
And even then, it's not clear whether they can get their rights.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
It takes a few extra letters for the forgers to sign up for their brands.
For example, Gucci will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prado, they will register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch is opening a file folder with a record of a stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had a brand Zegna DF Puma protected there. An artificial name, which also parasites at Ermenegildo Zegna's fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey commercial houses where counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
But Pattloch's cases are different. Under the authority of his managers, Chinese companies are quite officially entitled to use a label that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
That means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging business, we have to fight it," Pattloch calls.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive status disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and judicial costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market per year.
However, the deletion of questionable records in the register of brands is difficult to achieve and costs something.
Driving can stretch for up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the name in question became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff's bad luck, he has to pay the plagiarator because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
Known cases also relate to graphic items.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machines Sany, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
Thus, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the star of the Mercedes.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of Lacoste fashion goods lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO acknowledges that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too little staff and space.
But last year, it was said that "the process of working has returned from an emergency to normal"
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million brand protection applications were delivered to CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China is running a list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected on fees.
Easily, each log-in costs 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
To start a dispute against this is worth several times as shown by the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarizer for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitation car parts has been abolished.
However, the forger continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have forgotten this ourselves, as the surname cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanna Wentzler, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The stamp office of the CTMO then also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
Although Freudenberg has been able to exercise his rights in the other two instances, the opponent is still fighting in the dispute to this day.
You need to be very careful.
The matter is now under discussion in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "Control is extremely expensive and it costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves. "
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the archive of the company they even had to examine a hundred-year-old file to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered a "high six-digit amount in euro" to the counterparty in vain in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what this means to us," says Wentzler.
There is a threat that Europe will also be affected by the danger from the Far East.
And that's if the impersonators get unprotected tags.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
He gave up this business area long ago, yet managed to avert registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch both advise German businesses to be very careful in trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international stamp rights. Strangers should rather "everything worth protecting in any way, registering in China" says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of his drama, then he will probably have to pay the counterparty license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Stomping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir testes - and in Swaziland, orphans of parents who died of AIDS are delighted.
The story of a connection that transcends much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is stomping: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's loafers are looking for a tact on the dance floor and they find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise up, mom and chase each other.
The 29-year-old conductor of Fiete Hopf almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he joins the voices with his wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is testing a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years of age, from human genetics researcher to janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different text, and in addition in a very foreign language - zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to Self-Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of that, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland from parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans from parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second-degree schools.
A patronage can be taken over for 15 or 20 euros a month.
Guarantees a child's tuition, school uniform, and one hot meal a day at Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story teller " or" praiser " in the Zulu language.
No one in this space can speak but sing.
For nearly ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an airy distance of 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, there is an Esitjeni village in the northeast of the Swaziland Kingdom, which is dependent on the massiveness of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or strawy huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjeni, you can see in small, what the whole state of Swaziland is: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of male foreskin, which has proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity within themselves. There is no rarity that they die at less than 30 years of age.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. First of all, members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but completely everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, they have no chance in the poor country at all.
At first it was still a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed the child to go to school and give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, the "Voices for Africa " association, which has been taking care of orphans from parents who died of AIDS, was established almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Muffins and scabies are part of the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis, gonorrhea, and human papillomaviruses are common.
HIV is spread relatively little among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV are included in this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, there are often human papillomaviruses among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syphilis infected, according to the Institute of Robert Koch, more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIV has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of STDs?
Infections can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, so they will remain undetected.
How can it be protected?
The dangers of infection can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
For the origins of sexually transmitted diseases may also be partially transmitted by infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnosis it is possible to cure most SPIs and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, philanthropic donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir earns by singing throughout Germany will gather some money.
"We have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni in total," says Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the very village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
He also cares for orphaned children to find shelter, such as some of their grandmothers.
Gogo, as they call old women in Zulu language, is the support of the village.
Some of them have taken 14 orphans, placed a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children arrive on time every day in school uniforms.
Children who no longer have anyone go to Khanyisila's shelter, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school, built two henhouses, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had had a HIV test taken.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
The King With 14 Wifes
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because she has something to do with sexuality."
It's actually pretty weird in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his uncompromising lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life also bears, among other things, the guilt that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But even many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To promote cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi Corps travels once every two, three years together in South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, fighting, trust in the future and confidence of the blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of black people - such appreciation brings not only mood and joy, but also shed tears in many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Even if you can hardly find this village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the river Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," people say.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is a crow flies 8733 kilometers from here, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that Mercury's ice is on the planet.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even if it is located nearest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as it follows from three studies published on Thursday by the expert journal "Science."
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters strong.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps even from asteroids that crashed into Mercury.
But let's not add ice to the existence of life on this planet, said the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, discoveries could help us to clarify how water and other basic elements of life came into other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved earthlings, participate in exploration of the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, little windows to endless distances.
The film comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides that dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new conceptual definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, harder to identify are pink-colored "newborns" in the birthing room of stars.
This area where stars are formed - scientists unromantically call it W5 - discovered the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This changing heat of a dying star captured Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The muffin ring consists of a material that the star has thrown out during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid nebula, which is 5400 light-years away from the Earth, a new star emerges from the gas and dust.
A photograph of the galactic "cradle " was taken by Spitzer's telescope NASA.
The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors are better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to an observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away from the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity to the earth's continent brought out this nebula of the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of extraordinary coloring.
This "baby" among the stars was able to scan the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope in full beauty.
Saturn and his rings: how they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of Hubble's biggest and sharpest images: the vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies, according to their color, become real works of art.
The shot published by the European Southern Observatory shows a few thousand light-years distant Trifid nebula in the shooter's constellation.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triclonal) because the dark streaks of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar obstetrician into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonoš, astronomers photographed a portent of cosmic precipitation: at 400 million light years away from the Earth, the cores of the two combined galaxies take on each other, and there must inevitably be a collision.
This birth of the star was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy of M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical shortcuts can call it the Southern Windbreaker.
The photo from Hubble Space Telescope shows the cut-out of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefea.
This 1400 light-years away nebula consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual home dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It displays a ring from black holes, which is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810 scientists.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever new additions.
Also, these star clouds, connected to the Rosette nebula, are still giving birth to new young stars, which are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only shortly after the Big Bang when hydrogen was mostly in the universe.
Our Space Views: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the insights they convey are getting deeper.
The world's largest telescope was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
There's a Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, U.S.A.
It allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its average is about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of cheap construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its peculiarity is a high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, compares to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the radio telescope in Arecibo (Portorico), scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
When "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner who makes his computer performance available can help.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observation centre in the Chilean Andes.
Very Large Telescope stands here honoring his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should be full of 42 meters and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be expected first in 2018.
Two Keck binoculars on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space with the Subaru and IRTTF telescope.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a 30-metre diameter of the mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
But the most significant impressions from space provide us with Hubble's space telescope.
He has been providing us with shots of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Space Telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been detected since the mission began.
Last preparations are documented in the picture before the Kepler Space Telescope is launched.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be fired into space on board Ariane5 rocket at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that there is ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, as Messenger circles around this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have been showing for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many live to see the Bible's age.
There's even a museum of longevity.

In southern Azerbaijan, many live to see the Bible's age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Ride the Talyš Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The marrier rattles along the road with many corners along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything's green and juicy, it almost seems like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the caucasian ethnic group of Talyshes, which is not very well known, except that they speak both Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and live to be very old.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is somehow not suitable for the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. The arrival from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The fairy-tale wealth for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulaev (48) is convinced that Lerik has the power to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prize in May - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva says.
She's the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented life of nearly eight dozen Talysians from the area, who are over 100 years old. Fatulaeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who was said to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, Müslüm's age seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
This man was reported to have been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he said he still had a daughter.
So he was right about Müslümov at his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of elderly people in Central Asia.
"Apparently many people of old live in some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, " says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men. "
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the registers are missing.
Each day a glass of melted butter
The fact is, however, people in the area around Lerik live to see the Bible's age strikingly often.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why, then, do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talyshes.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatuliev Museum believes that this is about nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of Talyshes, who love meat, bread and mainly dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy does not seem to be quite credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, Ruba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a buttercup that he clings tirelessly.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both grandparents long ago.
There's two little kids jumping around.
Tea is prepared in the kitchen for guests, which is served in typical abdominal glasses of "armad."
Mirzayeva's white teeth form a perfect line and under the scarf she hides long dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look like it and kept the color.
"I never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
A month's pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven't even bought groceries in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his husband who was in the army.
It was the worst during World War II.
But everything got better when "beloved father" Gejdar Aliiev took over the oar.
Propaganda sounds weird from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
His son Ilham was in power until 2003.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan aren't in need.
Mirzayeva receives a pension of 230 managers every month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the amount of money from which to live.
And perhaps the long - gray son of Mirzayeva is right: "Old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture. "
They live in the midst of a large family, loved, cared for, and happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is lacking in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The devastating demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country's deep divisions.
It is strongly debated about a future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president didn't spare the pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for doing so, I am responsible in front of people and in front of God," he said on national television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All those who have so far hopelessly quarrelled in confused opposition are afraid.
Fear of "God's State " at the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost apologized for saying that he temporarily restricted the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "save the revolution."
But what the 61 - year - old engineer, who has the degree of a doctor at the U.S. University of Southern California, really wants to save, does not make the world clear.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs, which the head of the Constitutional Assembly with the supremacy of Islamists quickly approved in the 15-hour night marathon, are partly causing concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does "the principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it can be feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and associated legal space for stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least this explains the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Shari, it is necessary to consult Al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in a country with great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
It may not be, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over legislation, which would result in the justice system's effective withdrawal of its right.
There are many interpretations in the draft constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's governments to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As the proposal stands, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values. "
This is legally formulated so inaccurately that the state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature by means of this paragraph.
In an understandable language, it means nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no paragraph in writing defines explicit equality between men and women.
Yet another paragraph prohibits the reproach or slander of the prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
However, it remains unclear what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
Similarly, the wording is dubious that "insultation of people" is forbidden.
In this case, is the President's cartoon or a joke on the account of law enforcement experts already sufficient?
The matter of interpretation, as much else in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the outnumbered Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual convoy on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to pay.
"The revolution has come back and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who placed third in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej stated that the draft constitution belongs "at the junkyard of history."
Through Twitter's short-message service, he accused Mursi of wanting to "run against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Yasir Said, a member of the opposition.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," said the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Khalid Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared resistance to monstrosity, but out of caution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
It was attended by many shrouded women and Salafists who cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law. "
They called on Morsi: "Clean the earth!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, on which it all began, would probably trigger a similar state of civil war.
Apparently, Morsi's followers didn't want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opposers and supporters of the draft constitution were loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which way the country should go.
The majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered to be certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, calls for Hafiz Abu Sa'da.
Eighty-four-year-old human rights defender, and the chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR), defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or were in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
For that he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now there are no words of 'human rights' in the new constitution, "he complains in an interview for Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's expansion of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the President strengthening civil society, he actually abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get back at him.
A demonstration in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control. "
Norwegian Raffisk: The most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's success be linked to a local appetite for an extremely stinky fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it down for a week.
That's how you get the smell of the paralyzing stench of the coffin, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, a beautiful view - and there's a ubiquitous smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to stink.
As it gets dark and it gets cold, the Norwegians are starting to meet here in Fagernes at a festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, the most captivating meal.
"You will eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General" who is responsible for the course of the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat small dice of fish and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit rather than raffisk," says Havard.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it is not so bad - it is similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus journey.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when poverty was in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators, the fish dunked into airtight barrels with water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - no doubt their senses dulled with alcohol.
Only once a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country looking for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to a large amount of work, high earnings, and a large system of care.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival who was a long time ago much richer than Norway, are streaming to the country for work.
The coffin is viewed as something important, indispensable, even though a relatively stinking part of the Norwegian past.
They are among the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will come out at £9 ($14) per piece.
Norway often does not get into global news - and it seems to suit the majority of the population.
The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here by people with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called "the July 22nd event."
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970's.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic prosperity.
We're, as they say, considerate people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show off, we don't like lavishness.
Norway is handling its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else spent money that they didn't have in the years leading up to the global financial crash, the Norwegians had tight strings on their purse.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and take trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat a raffisk," he adds with carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of the coffin.
I'm sure a moose burger like that is something else and it's beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the stinking fish is back here.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where a raffisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live television broadcast with a news anchor and a bow tie surrounded by plates and a casks.
It's like the Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man may fall out of his chair, perhaps with an aquavit.
Or maybe fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the nation's leadership.
He's facing a challenging task.
Mexico has done well economically at the time of Felipe Calderon's resignation, but the country is in the clutches of a drug war that has already been estimated to have killed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US President, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, a populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
In the rural city of Valle del Bravo, for example, they remember him well.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These motorways are a huge improvement compared to the leaky and bumpy roads that were here earlier.
Boards with its name also hang on the walls of modern sports centre and impressive interactive museum with climate change theme.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a political ally for President Pen Niet's party, the Party of the institutionalized revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so urgently needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vincent Fox.
Member Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, many are expected from Enrique Pen Nieto inside the party.
And he refuses to express his opposition characterizing the new president as a man without substantial content.
He's a very straightforward man, very biased with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, contrast with paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways, it resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called upon to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, the critics of Pena Nieta say that he failed to deal adequately with the problem of women's murder.
And worse, his leadership is accused of closing their eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irine Buendia shows me photographs of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were post-mortem rigors on it, and it's already started with post-mortem rigor.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice."
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, troublemaker, and whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there are so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
Over the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor," says Mr. PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of mistreatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to disprove Bradley Manning's claim to be rude in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's military detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the gross treatment of Manning in prison.
Private is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified material in US history, has missed many of the opportunities to complain about the gross treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor has it. Ashden Fein, in cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during the nine months of custody in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination which took place during the hearing made on the defence's motion to dismiss the case against Manning due to gross treatment at the time of detention, which in itself is sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he was considering suicide in custody.
Military Intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is charged with theft of thousands of classified documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online at WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, the military prosecutor Fein and Manning went through the forms that the officers filed after meeting Manning in Quantico Prison, where he was held in an increased security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was regarded as "excellent" and the overall treatment in the facility was regarded as "very professional."
Forms show no complaints about mistreatment, even though Officers Manning directly asked how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why she did not complain about the treatment of her person in January 2011 when meeting with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed a few months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" mode.
The military indicated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under supervision on a suicide basis) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to the detention prison at the base of the naval infantry in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait, and one day he fainted because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was going on in the outside world was very depressing.
"My world only shrunk to the base of Arifjan, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, a band-aid, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against regulations.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side last night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint regarding the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made on Thursday's testimony regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other cellmates in the morning counting.
Manning testified that he wasn't allowed to cover himself with his blanket while counting.
During Friday's interrogation by Judge Manning, he stated that, by order of his guards, he had decided that he had a blanket to cover himself up, but he admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his underwear to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear was removed from his cell that night, his necklaces and glasses.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, she will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense stated that he was planning to plead guilty to lower crimes and that he was going to fight other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon has stated that Manning has been held in accordance with the regulations on all arrests in custody with maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence documents on the Internet, transfer of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If he's charged on all counts, he can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities there were.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone away; they remind of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico's capital, I barely broke through the crowd and arrived in the area for the immigrant agenda, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Aliens").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life I was called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic shortcut, same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
So later, I ended up with the term "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And there was no need to use shortcuts in my grandfather's homeland.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have a native speaker's vocabulary, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and put myself in line for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when President Enrique Pena Nieto, the newly elected Mexican president, visited President Obama in the White House this week.
On the agenda, they had common issues to discuss when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the same probability is that Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they will travel to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war on drug cartels, even though he didn't give any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under threat of weapons to rewrite half of Mexico's territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So one minute after the U.S. representative says something a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear a complaint in the Mexican press and among the elite about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will set foot on the warpath.
Yet Mexico is the real challenge of its relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers possibilities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, possibly a parent or a grandparents who had been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origins from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living the American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty isn't.
It's to the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and view us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left him.
And we would not now be found trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans do not like it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best from both countries, but you don't have roots in either.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "temporary ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and pressure political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans aren't ready to forgive the United States for their dealings with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel uneasy about how they were treated by their family members in a much closer past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
Ending the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such action is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary conjecture about who started this, many buildings were turned into ruins, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza fell near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the region's chaos.
Maybe it'll make their fight more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be not many reasons for optimization at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21 lasts, the battles of this week strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Hamas's leaders, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that they forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most pitiful and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently run by its hardened rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a revived regional power that once was Israel's closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, as did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering Hamas people say that the Islamic crescent is circling Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party/mile rule, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism can demolish Bashar al-Assad, up to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.
Above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and crucial Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is Hamas's cousin and its leaders are more influential public opinion.
Hamas may appear in future diplomacy as a player who cannot be voted out by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel's hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back into the box.
Israel's Iron Dome missile system has proven its worth and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever, and many European countries also blame Hamas for starting the last round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, particularly under Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the missiles from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, it has been relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that is interfering with the West Bank, the main parts of what may be a Palestinian state and protects Jewish settlements, which are still growing despite their unlawfulness against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party contacted an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
The hardline supporters may win, but the Arab spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than the cost of all its four Arab neighbors combined.
The launch of a new war with local superpowers will hardly help new Arab governments heal their economies.
The fact that President Morsi was working with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and could be the beginning of something new.
Israelis too should view the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates a denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination of a barrel of gunpowder, which one day must explode in the areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
At present, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is making this situation worse as the Arab population grows.
Bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need incentives from outside.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world, and the following newspapers: two states where Israel will pass on territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that the ceasefire will give pressure from the outside at least a little bit more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must act to stop the supply of weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a 1967 Jewish state with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from the outside must also push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual sovereignity at the UN to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has his share in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first parliamentary term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back at the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's pathetic nearsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarettes have come into force
Unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, show warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging, the first of its kind in the world, came into force, and brand logos and colors replaced the universal olive green boxes with nasty pictures of sick parts of the body and the display of children and newborns sick from smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between boxes is the names of brands that are printed in the same small type from Saturday.
This is the strictest regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by removing this habit from its attraction.
He relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking until they're 26 years old, there's a 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even in very small children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product," says the Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette wrappers, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal to the Australian Supreme Court law, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesale retailers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible setback, experts present the popularity of social media in the demographic group targeted by the plan.
After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and demanding that most retailers hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a tobacco marketing worker and you only have this small space to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Mrs Freeman has noticed an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza."
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to deal with new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries trade significantly with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected to be taken in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has had talks with other governments that are considering similar laws regarding packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and stick the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box of photos of a tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that the single boxes make it harder for him to level the shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "OK, that's it, let's close the store," he said, and he threw his hands out.
It's not so bad to be bored in a world of constant connection.
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are getting more and more bored with praise.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don't have a chance to enjoy boredom.
Should we support boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of Boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boring has a long history," he said.
A Latin inscription concerning boredom was found on the walls of Pompeii, originating in the first century C.E.
And then it's also a question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing research literature and showing the idea of a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was unable to do so. "
Boring differs from apathy by not being involved in anything, but wanting to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything with apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "the disruption of the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slowing time. "
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape that the person read from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "such as finding the wrong components on the factory line, distracting music can help you not to get bored. "
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and scribbling, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to wriggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored - late for my flight, humming speaker, especially a long movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of being bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the Boredom Proneness Scale.
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so much interest in not having time to do them all."
Using these scales scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodenovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in terms of the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said that they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said that they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he doesn't know whether the percentage of boredom would now be higher or lower, 21 years later.
But he said that he knew that "sleeping is a peak time for boredom, " which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boring good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to play gambling, or to abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodenovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Team is a way of telling you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your kid gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate trial is passed from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of constant grinding of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of needing to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise shuts down."
There is no guide in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law
A 19-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a university and a footballer from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and pipe he used for her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he drove with some friends in Lamar on the plains near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was given a summons for possession of drugs and drug equipment - minor offences, with a fine of USD 100 per fine - and a court date was set.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on legalising a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends more on the ground than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana possession have already been abolished here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults of 21 years of age and older for possession of small quantities that will be legally authorised after the law has come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts of Colorado said they'd continue with existing marijuana cases, and they're still blaming people for possession.
At the same time, several cities from the outskirts of Denver towards the western mountains vote to prevent the opening of new, licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Controllers in Washington are also gossiping their heads.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all until December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State liquor licensing board.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent for us to follow," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but a legal hold.
And there are some difficult mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the State Directive on "appropriate access" to licensed cannabis with its prohibition of trade in cannabis within 330 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will be more difficult to place licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Legal Cannabis Centre, a recently established research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates from Aurora sent his officers an e-mail telling them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute crimes for possession of a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over 21 years of age and that the police would stop "with immediate effect" accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug dealers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a tighter view.
After the vote, he declared that his office would continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way of pushing users to seek treatment.
Currently facing charges of holding 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, although many of them face additional charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences at the time they were committed," Buck said in his statement.
The response was complicated in places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer accuses adults of holding small quantities.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to reject all ongoing possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the Colorado voters supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed deep divisions among local officials with regard to this great state green experiment.
For district attorneys it is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver representing the defendants for possession of marijuana, and a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still cannot actually accept that it is legal," he said.
Colorado and Washington are on their way to becoming national testing cases for drug legalization.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several arrests by marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients who use it, who have attracted attention, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to break down the door to pick up a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will resist allowing state-controlled recreational marijuana trafficking permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser for President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities aren't waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments have approved moratorium on any new marijuana business, even if it will take about a year before any trade can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the West proposed a six-month ban and it is likely that it will enter into force next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where we license someone and then we will have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative. "
Today's university students are not the only ones being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest seat of knowledge, a modern vignette Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of taking up Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, pack my bags and go into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard said I gave up because I objected to the love of students in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson blurted out that I had left because I was forced to drink from beaten cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask me why I'm bringing it up now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students on the right from the center suffers similar persecutions.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of Younger Years (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and shown not to be welcome. "
They ask for a position in the University Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they can communicate their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary programme called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student political events that Conservatives described as weird and neo-Nazis.
Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who was a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "sacrifice lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Twenty - year - old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservation Association, told Sunday's newspaper that "the leftist influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
A 21 - year - old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unpleasant" while the 19 - year - old president of the OCA, Stephanie Cherill, says that there has been a deterioration in the JCR's approach to the people on the right from the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I started in September 1986, 18 - year - old and cripplingly shy.
Hate against the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse the honorary title of former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding higher education.
Even Stalinists would tremble at the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students meet each other and with professors, I got a taste of the wormwood that was to come.
I found that not only do professors silently approve of teasing conservative pupils, but they are also interested in participating in them.
The policy of the mining strike, privatisation and resistance of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was introduced into the wood-covered auditoriums.
My first lecture related to the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty hard.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake dough, was very biliary.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were giggling.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I was devastated and returned to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a light tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly said.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I tried to cowardly pretend.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (what irony) went to Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig. "
You're infected.
The other students didn't mention him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before liberal legislation from the 1960s.
Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to associate with similar-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a laborist and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years have developed before me as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an advisor to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one who writes her speeches.
He was barely there.
He hated the place for its provinciality and pettyness and for its propensity to a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he joined the position of professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940 ' s, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes were drooling.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the course of teaching, when another history professor said in complete seriousness that I was "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing with shame inside, I confessed to having my "parents brainwashed" and called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-term.
A nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammered by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week for Murdoch's paper.
My door was locked.
I ducked inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snotty wimp.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poisonousness in an educational institution.
But even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but also hiding to this day behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of fashion creation" which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascalová, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszová and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabel I. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of fashion creation" which represents more than 130 models of high fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but without his honored clients could not be written.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which will last until 3 March, overflows with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from Voghera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international "Bohemian elite."
There's nothing wrong with loving a royal family.
"At least they don't put a cigarette in a great carpet like some beautiful pop-music celebrities," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy ample and elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to glory.
He's still a star."
Valeria Mazz performing Valentina
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazz doesn't forget the charisma of the designer.
"It's been many years since we went to his house for dinner after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every little detail of his apartment, decorations, food, music, everything he reckoned and felt his spirit.
All invited people could feel important and loved," recalls the top model who started working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"Never goes out of fashion because his designs are artwork," he concludes.
A Parade of Nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly reciprocated love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was converted into a distinctive 70-metre-long passage that offers a role-changer: a visitor turns into a model and marches through a passage to observe the "generality" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces wearing as a dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti wore in "Night" or a coat made of wool and fur belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience of mannequins glow names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norwegian, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "can't be forgotten"
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, a gillette vest and an autumn-winter jacket from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity and great love for women because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Ferii.
"I really like the colors he uses, they brighten up a lot, and they give a spark to his face.
The proportions are perfect."
Neither Princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovanampaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentina first dressed.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be full - time and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
She finally got to the end of the '90s.
"I bought my first Valentina dress to celebrate at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with a call, a rag and a strapless top.
It was a dream that came true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life develops between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has saved the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that have inside them"
"King" fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Pavel Greece in 1995.
To create these silky dresses of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a train of four and a half metres long were needed four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialised press, this dress represents the milestone of the late 20th century's high fashion, "the return of clients from high society."
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elitist "savour-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honours in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated by the Order of Honorary Legion accumulates as much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, peace, a well-designed and perfect look," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum a month ago.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was great. Time left no trace of him."
If the princess says so...
The hardest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, they gamble carriers in the area of Indonesian volcanoes with their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are people who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anta Wijay, one of the 400 miners who earn a living conquering sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of Java Island of Indonesia.
Because of this, they have to burn every day to the bottom of the crater, where they escape sulphur gases from the inside of the Earth, and when they contact the air, they go into solid condition.
After cutting out large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, it carries them on its shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2 386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to rise at the rate of turtles, maintaining balance and carefully considering their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur that they mine
When they're upstairs, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they tirelessly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has benefited in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for making matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar whitening.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (EUR 3.8) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The miner's daily wage is very high here. For example, 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) per day are paid for collecting coffee and two million rupees (EUR 167) per day are paid for 14 days," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (EUR 6.2) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's coughing, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already taken its toll on him, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's coughing, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases leaking from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to reach his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," promises more than decent English.
This likable and intelligent young man affected by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead does the work of a janitor.
It shares a filthy wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop rising at night and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows dark.
Despite the darkness surrounding, Anto burns into the crater and illuminates his way through a small lamp that is attached to his helmet and bought it with his own money.
About 400 racks on the shoulders of the crater crater basket
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanized sulphur extraction for cost savings, nor does it provide any means of delivery for self-employed persons and with such effort, any equipment.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) from the photo supplement, which, together with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), selects natural park guards from tourists arriving to photograph volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, not for people," objects Madrusin, a massive 42-year-old carrier who has worked in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can keep working "as long as possible" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and it stings in the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches miners in dense fumes coming out of the volcano, miners are so claimed that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
At the age of 53, Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can load only 50 kilos.
Each day, he and his colleagues dig up 15 tons of sulphur in a volcano, and then three trucks take a steep road between the thicket and the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik, opening wide mouths with a few teeth missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, the 30-year-old, also earns by mining sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore's looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans seduce that they have no children, no careers, no stress, no cost of living and no education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy commercial, but still - or maybe that's why - the video spread to YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local references such as "let's put a chick in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, who created the video, hopes that they will be able to highlight the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill their "civil duty."
"This is exclusively a matter of the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that it was a subject that we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying to expand perfume with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, such as the composition of rap, to solve this problem."
1,2 children
Whoever doesn't take it too lightly is the Singapore government.
They spend USD 1,300 a year encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich urban state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The rate of birth in Singapore with regard to the layering of the population is currently 1.2 child per woman.
Last time, the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Bureau of Population, says that this is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"People thus have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it is not just a wedding and a family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of single people and delaying marriage and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this caused resentment among the local population.
On some Singaporean websites, unhidden xenophobia is seen against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and little commitment to integration.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government of Singapore recorded its worst electoral outcome since the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, efforts were made to address the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rate has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many little houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had a great success in sales.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can promote a bachelor's lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the EL Developers developer company, claims that their shoeboxes are sold much faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, by selling them days to weeks faster than houses with larger size.
That is why they are much better for our cash flow."
However, it admits that new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed out.
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the birth rate of a nation, a conversation with Singaporeans working in a financial district downtown suggests that they will not have a great effect.
"People are always stressed out, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people put it off," says the young clerk.
"Let the others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, it's the Singaporeans who have the last word about starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal nature or "a private life area that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption. "
What is privacy for a man under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he's posting matters on the Internet that he certainly wouldn't tell anyone during normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "completely own" in a personal way and as "user name and password" when it came to social networks.
"I wouldn't publish my biggest secrets," says ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice photos or pictures of us playing on the FB.
I'm also talking to friends there.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would mock someone," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on the FB and his nine Twitter supporters.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up an account on Twitter to express my views and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer, I'm just putting them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and at the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I am not afraid because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them put him up to anything or asked him for an address or phone number.
"If they urge me or require me to do so, I simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his Twitter recommendation.
This boy is not a stranger to experience what is now called cyberbullying (cybershikana).
"A friend of mine was being blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was," he confirms.
According to Jose, the victim didn't check out of his account.
"She just activated the private regime."
Then explains a series of steps to safely set up the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I'd do it if I didn't mind or if I just felt like it.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of education and teaching, considers that children and adolescents in social networks need to understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
It states: "The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed. "
Marrielos Porras notes that an academic worker named Marc Prensky, a graduate of teaching at Yale University and the author of the article Digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born during this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that this is a difficult subject, "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature. "
Also, to be - as far as surroundings are concerned - discreet, at a time when what they desire most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is, asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do anything doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, "Would you like it if someone posted your picture the way you posted your friend's picture?"
Do you know what other people are publishing about you?
When you refer to the person in the photos of the party, did you ask these persons for permission?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to make them realize that they have to behave in the environment of the Internet as well as outside of it.
It's the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be done on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-level teacher, and an educational counselor explains that it is essential for parents to read the rules of social networking carefully.
"If they understand every sneaky thing, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences that an Internet account can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional "do not talk to strangers" rule.
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without a statement from Lima being issued, which was announced and allegedly signed by seven presidents present.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State or Government of Unasur, but representatives of both the State Department and the Presidential Office, who initially determined to publish the document after the summit, stated that it would later be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
They also stated that the contents were published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in a few brief press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the Presidential Assembly without sound was transmitted in the press room with a message of "confidential meeting, audio transmission prevented"."
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present but not by the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, which led to the disapproval of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it is just a statement from President Humaly, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the third South American and Arab summit (América del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, although the press was eagerly required.
On the official website of ASPA it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure a broadcast for all journalists, but they completely prevented the supply of information.
The summit ended, inter alia, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the Hague Court, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President of Chile Sebastian Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday by hearing the defence speech of both parties discussing the dispute that Lima initiated against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a verdict that will resolve the dispute that we are debating today in this international court," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," added Piñer and greeted President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice decision was published after Colombia adopted this week by the Bogotian Pact, thereby expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered that this decision was completely incorrect.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the recall of former President Fernando Lug and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was entrusted with the opening of morning talks and the conclusion of the Lima Summit shortly after noon.
The President has read the final document stating that 16 agreements have been adopted and 31 projects have been planned between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR member countries will take "important steps towards the objective of South American citizenship for which residence agreements are being extended'.
He informed that actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, better access to medicines and cheap Internet in all parts of South America and common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters" were supported.
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) does not have a winning essence, but it is meant to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future, " said Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between different South American locations, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries can be better connected and create new economic links," said the President of Peru.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concern a better connection with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return it to the Union of South American Nations" from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before attending a regional meeting, said that he hoped to meet with his Nicaragian counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully discuss the International Court of Justice's judgment concerning the maritime border dispute, which is called into question by Bogotou.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor is the Treaty with Nicaragua requiring negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate form possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta there.
In the context of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers have provisionally gathered to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the area.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Today, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must really learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared on State TV that the Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, it defended the project for the creation of South American citizenship, which Unasur members support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still backward areas that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
Among other things, the President of Ecuador has stated that he agrees to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," he referred to Ecuador's founder, WikiLeaks, to Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at that time "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange might be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process ".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice system, which asked him to submit to an interrogation in Swedish territory for alleged sexual offences, "with the Swedish legislation making it possible to conduct an interrogation by videoconferencing a call that could take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London'.
Correa said that there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that he was having minor pulmonary problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But there is a risk that his physical and mental condition will deteriorate because he is locked up in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
This would affect everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the asylum solution provided to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks have taken place with London in order to solve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzon is leading a series of proceedings in various European instances," he said.
He stated that "if Great Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over"
And if Sweden listens to Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation allows, without a problem, and as has already been done in other cases, this problem will be put to an end tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as defender of freedom of the press and made it clear that he certainly does not tolerate "under-averageity, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, the vicious and degenerate politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that no such journalists, "no bankers, no hegemonic countries, no bourgeoisies control Ecuador" and said that if he was reelected, "there will continue to be changes in the right direction and direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue the veto expressed by Paraguay on membership of the Union of Unasur at least until its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunisticism and coupism wrapped in legality" because it in fact "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, Ecuador's President stated that he considered "quite appropriate" the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries now, after the judgment of the Hague International Court, which he ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not accepted at the moment.
"This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed wide in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed his hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute at the same court in Peru and Chile and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to take a judgment, no matter how harsh it may be".
In connection with the possibility of running for office in the next presidential election in Ecuador to apply for the third mandate, he noted that he perceived this option "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
"I have never personally been interested in power, but such unfair situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, I get the same thing.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Madure, who says that President Chávez has left for a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the President's health," he explained.
Today, the head of Ecuador's state attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning had struck me," he relates in the memory of the moment of truth that the doctor tried to "a little lessen" but apparently without success.
The boy kept it a secret from his family.
He decided to take his own disease on his own, and he started to find out about it, with such commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most recent HIV units in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several fights with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and greater stigma.
At that time, even the director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut. "
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their disease and who are losing it when the virus has caused the body to destroy and has exhausted the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years after AIDS disease or at least the first documented cases occurred in the world, "is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people " said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital, with this information being confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication this April.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full life depends on the degree of disability in the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, while those who do not use drugs are better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live for up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells for up to 50 years.
To put it simply, the person who is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can "live without problems until 75 years of age " according to these findings.
To highlight this progress, it should be recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4862 in 2011 (UN/AIDS - UNAIDS Joint Programme yearbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since AIDS was discovered according to national statistics.
Only in the state of Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and by May this year, so far 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
Why do people continue to die from disease?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the supply of medicines. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of the disease, or in the late stage of the disease."
It adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection has already occurred. All we need to do to influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier and therefore to offer large-scale tests for the detection of the disease to all those who ask for it. "
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to be tested in a private laboratory just because it was done by his friend, and despite his low age, he had already developed AIDS disease and also suffered from Kaposi' sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm gonna die, I'd rather go out three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for the better, healthy eating, practicing, taking medication."
To this day, his parents know only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I look out for myself and for the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted the call to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO daily to motivate those who are afraid to testify today on World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested, if they risked it, let them know if they're HIV positive, it's better, and if they've already been diagnosed, no matter how much they realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarizes the motto of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guatemalan journalist who is researching information on HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this "really increased condom handing out, used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacies and medical staff who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution, let the condoms not only be behind the counters, but let the hundred be found in the dispensers in the public bathrooms, in places where the young often go.
"It's not support for promiscuity.
It's not even about paying them a beer and a motel, how Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
There is no such sexuality. It is best to make condoms available to those who have already led sexual life," he remarked.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV) were reported.
This is the fourth place in Mexico in new and identified cases of AIDS and the 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the infection occurs by sexual route, 6% by blood route y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, since there are four to five people who do not know about the disease on one registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt by a bankruptcy in Mexico, gives an unfortunate precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the restructuring procedures of firms that allow Mexican laws do not appear to apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale at the bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves, in practice, Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of confiscating their assets on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the door to the United States Supreme Court for the main Mexican glass producer, referring to three irregularities.
It must be said, first of all, that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinationals.
In essence, a United Nations model law was created for this purpose to unify international commercial law, which is determined by an arbiter by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of branches from the internal corporate structure, when Vitro's parent company's debt to branches is recognised, the required majority would not be reached to approve the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws allow this possibility.
The fact is that Vitro's case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexico, for whose in-house debts the Federal Bankruptcy Institute has guaranteed.
Furthermore, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of the branches, creditors - who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. the "dup" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convertencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach the majority.
In the vote, they would have reached about 45 percent to 37.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, Vitro blames the difficult situation that it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has struck the United States.
In the meantime, the family company González Sady will appeal for a new assessment directly at the appeal court in order for the assessment to take place with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because initially only three voted.
If he fails here, he will demand, as an appeal, a revision of the process by a higher instance, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
The case is serious because the court forgot the document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae, in which Vitro's procedure under the Competition Act is described in detail, pointing out that the company has made it easier by leaning towards agreements signed by both countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States insolvency law.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for both Vitro and the State.
Overall rating
There was a criminal report by Mexican aviation unions against the former owner of Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent conduct for several months, and according to the pilots' union, the vessel has already overflowed.
An instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstructing justice.
In its view, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, in which it withdrew 198 million pesos from the F/589 Fideikomis from IXE on behalf of Mexican aviation.
The funds were probably directed towards the purchase of shares in the Professional Management of Hotels (Administradora Professional de Hoteles).
As we know, Azcárraga Andrade is a major shareholder of the Posadas chain of hotels.
Siege of Dragon Martu
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of an association met at the Universidad de Caribe on the weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Marta in Kankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution centre with products from "a country with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Already before, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industries de Transformación) has been able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to oppose a monumental complex that would partially devastate the protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of issue with ACTA document
The request made by the Senate, which the Government failed to take into account and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicono de la Propiedad Industrial), expired.
As is known, this has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of calling it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world traveler Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor has "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was enthusiastic about this sport for more than 60 years, whether he was a younger category player, a BSN national basketball league player, Vaqueros de Bayamón's owner and coach in the national basketball league, or the President of the Puerto Rican basketball Federation.
"I have played a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including a few at the same time, as when I was the president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the general director of the national team and the chair of the Federation," Reyes recalled his faithful wife, who lived in my home in Bayamón, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and souvenirs from his long career, testify.
♪ Bayamon in the heart ♪
With the greatest movement of all, he guards those who recall his presence in the Vaqueros since the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to participate with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967 in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the championships - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here, and at that time worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me: "I have a two-meter-long player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me the quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamon the championship victory, Gausse would contribute to the next."
He enjoyed the championship when he played Gausse for the Vaqueros team, but only remotely, because in 1988 he already served as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we finished the neighborhoods, but we should have had bronze if not for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final pitching," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the National Team in the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and hit the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that blew out our bronze at the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fic López and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
The team, which may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was a team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in the Argentinean Neuquén.
With roster players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players voted out for a fight in the Pan-American games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was Piculín Ortiz, no doubt.
His international tournament numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his involvement in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work very much from the young.
What is your success in the Federation that you consider the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the National League of BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What didn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as dividing youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the contribution in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistants of referees and referees.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
I listen most to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, world famous for John Ross Ewing's leading role, more known as "J.R." in the TV series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as a predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series Dallas, died in the 1980s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new series Dallas, died according to the official announcement of the family provided to the Associated Press by the production company Dallas Warner Bros, on Friday afternoon on cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was his wife's representative in the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in Dallas hospital," announced Agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," said Linda Gray in her announcements.
The Hagmans diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he had a malignant tumor found in his liver, and Hagman had a transplant.
Years before the Dallas broadcast, Hagman was famous on TV as a decent guy in a light comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when she meets an attractive girl (genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were broadcast briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in films included roles that were well accepted by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was up to Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R., which led him to the stellar peak.
The CBS Dramatic series on the Ewing Clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot Jayar?" that was supposed to arouse expectations about the work full of emotions, when Hangman's character is almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of spectators worldwide but also the risk of millions of dollars in tight offices.
This also helped this episode to achieve a record in the audience.
On average, 41 million TV viewers watched November 1980, as Dallas became the second most watched entertainment programme of history after the end of the broadcast of the MAH series in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin fired on J.R. (who was played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and a cheating husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be locked into rehab.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his tombstone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen. "
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The filming of five parts of the second series has already been completed and the sixth part has just been filmed," the TV station informed.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the show would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martinová, who shined in classic works such as South Pacific musicals and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950's, Larry tried to be lucky on the theatre scenes in New York, and then from 1952 to 1956 he served in England in the Air Force.
There he met young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, who he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published an autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or hurt anyone," Prensa Asociada told the agency.
After a liver transplant, he started promoting organ donation and volunteered at a hospital where he helped fearsome patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
The course that explores the "end of the world " begins
Every week students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course about the end of the world, he knew that it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the "long" Mayan calendar to come on December 21st, many people seized as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charme, however, had no idea what was ahead of him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call "Luhový Armageddon," and the growing conflict in which Israel was drawn, a place where, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for the apocalyptic-minded.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last one in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is holding a course called "Mediums, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are discussing why these ideas are spreading over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students are analyzing movies with apocalyptic themes and exploring how different they are from real life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have come together to organize a course called End of the World.
"We don't add "2012" because we always count on the possibility of organizing the course again if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite "dangerous destruction, " students must study, develop projects, and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very evening of the expected end of the world," Restall said.
Courses have become pretty popular.
"He expanded within two hours," Restall said about his high-average course, which he applied for.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester we received questions by e-mail as to whether there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden, 23-year-old Bridgeid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Thus, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which to teach it before," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the date of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan predictions and in some ways we disprove it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused the boom of these speculations.
"People don't think about it anymore," he said.
It happens in the vast majority in the English - speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about a course on "the end of the world," answered quickly.
"Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception to the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final judgment were mentioned, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven - year period at which the world will end.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Several have said that they intend to go to the festival "the end of the world. "
"I think I'll call some friends to laugh together," explained Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
