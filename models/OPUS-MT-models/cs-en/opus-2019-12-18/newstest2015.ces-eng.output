Petr Čech: Last-minute transfer?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance won't come in winter.
Petr Bohemia, currently Chelsea's replacement goaltender, now does not sit over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Smíchov NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is preparing for a Czech rehearsal with Americans and then also for a sharp start qualification about Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In the goal of Chelsea in the new season Premier League takes priority Thibaut Courtois, the Czech first time in ten years in the London club became an alternate.
Some time ago it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup at the beginning of the season in duels with Atlétice and couldn't even make it to the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He pulled two wins into the French league season and two draw, shot up St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pushing boot club AS Monaco.
He's got 1-1-2 in the league so far, and he broke up with Lille at 1-1 this weekend.
News popped up on the tabloid English website today that the Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, the Czech departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet set a course of four to one on him.
Peter, is it possible that you'll still change your jersey in the last few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100% in football.
Maybe there'll be an offer during the day that can't be rejected.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(CHUCKLES) "Well, I don't know yet what such an offer, which can't be rejected, actually looks like.
It would have to be a consensus of all parties First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position whether or not the club would have dealt with the offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you're in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new assignment?
That's not what I was thinking.
But there's a lot of players in this situation today, they're all at some representation meetings somewhere, and I'm sure a lot of transfers are gonna close today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs are there on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
And you don't pressure yourself to leave?
The situation where I didn't catch a new season in the first three games is new to me after 15 years of career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack and go anywhere.
I want to continue this fight for goalie Chelsea's position, and it's up to the coach who he chooses, what decisions he's gonna make over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I'm taking all the factors into consideration.
Of course, it is a sporting aspect that matters to me, but I also look at it from a personal aspect, which of course the needs of the family belong to.
Is it possible that you would catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought would never concern me.
But anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law designed to protect the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"According to how unions work, middle-class jobs work," says Ellison, the Democratic Senator for Minnesota, co-chair of the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud to present, along with the example of occasional rights, John Lewis, a law that strengthens the position of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal opportunities to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-union forces
To amend the Labour Relations Act to allow all workers who face discrimination if they want to join the trade unions, to sue a civil court - and to sue compensation or compensation - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other plaintiffs put in the law is to reestablish America's ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans have once supported countries around the world to adopt, extend and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country was one breather of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to gather.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisors supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, including the language, and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, negotiate collectively, and act is guaranteed. "
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisors urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore they included a clause that openly states: "The law of creating associations that will ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to every profession or profession.
Arrangements that will restrict or seek to damage this right will be abolished. Measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the plaintiffs and Roosevelt guaranteed that "each has the right to create and enter trade unions in the protection of her interests. "
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is certainly necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organise and enforce themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the nation's strength, but have expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the union forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History is not forgotten, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring ideals that raised America and made it the true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could have shut down all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
The federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisian law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
A regulation enacted by the signature of Louisian Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, they must obtain this authorisation.
"The proposing party will be able to legally carry out its activities and in the meantime obtains a permit," states Federal Judge John deGravelles' resolution.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution concerning the law.
Activists for the right to abortion welcomed the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, and said that it would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a sneaky law designed to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Executive Director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who, on behalf of three out of five clinics, has claimed to block the law.
It was not clear whether the decision also concerns doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and they also apply for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such provisions unconstitutional.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state would be blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abortion, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have such permission places requirements on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents opposed the fact that measures aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed due to measures.
The reproductive rights centre indicated that only one abortion doctor is authorised in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear of his safety, said the group.
In response, the Louisiana authorities stated that they would not punish the abortion doctors while waiting to process the application for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment kills ovarian cancer more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of their deceased mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in Australian countryside are at greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records of over 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% of five years after diagnosis lived.
The head of research, Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, reported that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New medicines can slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"Sickness can best treat gynekooncologists who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving remote medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen the transport service that allows specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published by the Medical Journal of Australia today.
In March 2012, young mother Elisha Neave of Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer at her age of 33.
Garden centers regret a reduction in the number of homeowners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline in homeowners under 35 years of age could lead to the "main age group of gardeners " of today's young generation of consumers losing up to £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent housing spend on their gardens on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own.
As other factors threatening the sector, which earns an estimated £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanized areas where there are no gardens, like pavement instead of front gardens used as a parking area and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% over six years, the lowest expenditure on gardening products in Britain is due to one household.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society have stated that housing in a sublease or lack of space does not mean that humans cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief garden counselor for RHS, said: "In the tenants, plant growing in pots is very popular - when they move, they can take the plants with them. "
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the gardening retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin at his youth organization's convention, which reminds me most of all of it Hitlerjugend, was ravaged by atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that he didn't care about their views, he gave us a lecture today on democracy.
However, I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be mastered both by the tense nationalism and by the fact that the inferiority complex can transform into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to pass in the east differently than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the war over Europe was long gone, in the East, it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and must regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration ruled Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis took power and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the destruction of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that is indeed quite similar.
Vladimír Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the second part shook before them.
Probably Western politicians caused it themselves, maybe little was patting Vladimir on the shoulders, maybe not inviting him where he wanted to go and maybe underestimating him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made a house call, pretended that he didn't really want to go anywhere and sharpened knives at home.
Now he's decided to take back the lost positions.
He's gonna start slow, he's got time.
He's probably in charge of life, so where would he rush to?
He trampled the Caucasus, now he trampled the Ukrainians, then the Dwarves of the Baltics are next.
They've been biting a Russian bear in a fur coat long enough.
I'm sure China will notice that, too, who's jumping a little too much, and she's definitely looking for the far east.
And those Germans are pissed off about Vladimir, too, how well they're doing, and that's what we gave them when they were 45.
How about a new Novorosiji in Karlovy Vary?
That would be a base and there's plenty of ours, and as they're being pushed in, they've already tried to tear down any of them.
I mean, our veterans are gonna remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
I mean, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, he can be peeled like onions, and I can eat their whole EU.
It would be so much fun to get them to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of where their place is.
And as detonators, we'll use our comrades who live in their territory.
There's enough Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed, they're just being oppressed, and we don't leave it that way, we protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, for what else is he born to do.
After all, Europe is good as a preposition for which proud Ivan can dance Cossack.
Turkey subpoenaed an American diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister has called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the US charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept stated that Turkey was a priority target of the US and British intelligence services, according to documents provided by a former US National Security Agency analyst.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan countered the importance of the report and stated that all major states were watching each other.
The earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, provoked a more bitter reaction in the Turkish government.
The Game of Thrones presented other tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the iconic series.

Director of Magaluf Police Charged with Corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of blackmail by police officers and city hall officials in Calvia's Autonomous Region to the Office of the Mallor State Prosecutor.
The head of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after charges brought against businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was accused of corruption by several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballen, a street where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the Internet daily Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of blackmail to the prosecutor of the Mallorca Corruption Office on the part of police officers and civil servants of the City Hall in the Calvia municipality.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for connection to corruption charges, and together with Navarro, the judge will question them.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted disgruntled night business owners, according to which preferential treatment by public officials has a serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer about making money, but about surviving," said one of the businessmen in court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube who gave oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to oversee drunkards and rioters in the ranks of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where there was an oral sex event, was forced to close for a year and together with Carnage's tour operators to pay a fine of 55,000 euros (73,000 dollars).
The Magalauf tourist resort, which is popular mainly with the British, was also witnessed by many alcohol accidents, including a fashion wave known as "balconing," where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel swimming pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide airport
JARO brought South South Australia an ice surprise, came with a heavy rain and a violent wind, which seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is due in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short showers connected with the storm and wind gusts, which began eight o'clock in the evening and brought almost 4 mm of precipitation within about ten minutes.
After a few early doses of spring came after the winter last week, on Monday the temperature in the city fell again to just 15,8 °C.
Storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 19:30, but at short distances it was hit by a change in speed or direction of wind and was forced to delay landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at that time reached the ground speed of about 50 km/h.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop the second landing and finally landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently led to delays in other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to the forecast, the temperature in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two showers may appear.
Israel's Children Return to School After the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, rockets and mortars attacked their homes.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel, but signs of struggle are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the workers of the preschool, hit by a rocket, removed the remains of shrapnel from the wall and slowly expect the children to return.
"We are a little scared, but otherwise we look forward to it," said Ronit Bart, resident of Kibucu Saad and English teacher at local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to the routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said that "it's a little weird" to go back to school at once.
"We've had some hard times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuben Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and set off to safer areas away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many Nachal Oz residents, a village near the Gaza border, in which a missile from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, hesitate to return.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding: "We will provide you with education and security. "
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an unlimited amount of time.
The cease-fire led to the immediate end of the fighting, but it did not solve key problems such as Hamas's demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel is questioning these figures and estimates that at least half of the killed were radicals, even though there is no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired during battles on Israeli cities mainly in the south of the country 4 591 missiles and missiles from mortars.
The Israeli army, in turn, made more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in a hundred UN schools that turned into a provisional shelter.
Because of tens of thousands of people who are still in hiding, school officials postponed the beginning of the school year due to the ongoing struggles last week.
"I hope they will soon open the school so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in Gaza's largest city.
I stand by your willow.
And the Lafata is troubled by the temperature
The Czech football team met today before noon in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-member castle, Spartan attacker David Lafata has problems with his temperature.
David isn't here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players, and David probably still has a little bit of problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," said Pavel Vrba to the journalists.
"Whether it's two or three days, or tomorrow he'll be fit, we'll see that from his medical condition, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it's not like they couldn't train or take part in a match on Wednesday with the US," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday night Vrba called as the last player of Spartan backup Lukáš Váhu.
He admitted that this was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I made a decision based on the fact that Luke is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision-making was very difficult, but I stand by it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latatoo.
It is not possible that the nomination could still change in case of health problems.
On the weekend, for example, Liberec's Josef Šural, who gave a hat trick, flashed with great performance.
Of course there are players who have recently shown form.
Let's see how David Lafata's doing.
In the event that it cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot dominate any of the players who have taken an interest in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there will be a representation of training in Strahov, on Tuesday there will be classic pre-game training before duel with the USA on Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by a signing.
The game with Americans is played on Wednesday at 20:15 and the national team in it will seek premier victory under the Willow.
In the previous three preparatory games, he played two draws and once lost.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on the agenda on 9 September at 20:45.
Pesice is going to Italy on the Netherlands
The willow is glad to have more time for training than previous meetings.
It is an advantage when you have players eight days and you can rehearse with them certain things that maybe we didn't have so much time before.
We will now be able to concentrate only on preparing ourselves for the Netherlands as best we can," Vrba praised.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy before the match in Prague on Thursday and the duel will be personally watched by former temporary coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a game and we're gonna have a video game and we're gonna talk about him.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent World Championship.
According to the very monitored statistics, the prices of flats in the winter period have increased most in the last seven years.
According to the index of the value of flats in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased housing prices by 1.1% in August, the agency reported on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase has risen to 10.9%, more than twice as much per year until August 2013, but the profit has not been evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP figures Data show that housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne increased by 11.7%.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising between five and six percent on average.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was placed, which was damaged by a state-ordered reduction in expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties will increase for sale in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"In view of the continuing high level of auction sales, generally high sales speed and low interest rates, the housing value is likely to increase even further over the next three months," he said.
My father never hugged me.
He never said "I love you" to me.
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, the Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked at the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is trying comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through "thorough" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew so little about him.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice say, "Stop the racket.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were adults - went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading newspapers.
Henry recently visited Dudley's foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he looked into what life must have been like for him.
There's a little bit more light in there today, but it's still dark, smoky, grim labyrinth, where the flames explode, and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
My dad always got in the tub and just lay there, and then I could hear him slowly starting to sing for himself because he was washing the foundry off.
When I was passing by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Daddy didn't hug anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
When my mom was sick and dying, we started thinking, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who she has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Will you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
French, who he's been married to for 25 years, is still good friends.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and there were signs of diabetes, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat carrots.
A change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After receiving recognition from critics for his Othell, he plunged into the theatre.
A comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's fences followed.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on stage parody someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent show.
His TV career began in the mid - 1970 ' s: "For a long time I was the only black impersonator/comic on TV. "
He learned as he marched.
Besides having to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn how to make up working jokes, be a star and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Given that his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors disguised themselves as blacks, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was already uncomfortable about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "the years and years of the award-winning major product of British television " was also" the grotesque parody of blacks. "
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters that also ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to air in 1984 and in the 1990s was among other things known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him away from commercials, documents, TV shows, and movies, but after broadcasting his series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you gonna do now, Len, it looks like you're stuck in one place or you're a little out of the way."
Next was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really study him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get into it if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othello's closing statement for the documentary, and he was already in on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"That's what this is about.
So the rehearsal was tough, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical glitch, and Henry felt instinctively that he had to take responsibility for confiscating the audience.
"The voice in my head said, "Before he fixes the computer, you must entertain them for ten minutes."
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle this for me.
"You play, so stay in character."
Henry in the fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the fence text was a challenge.
Panic is quite good, it adds determination.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a sound voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Still, Henry's brain remains a comedian - the whole time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and steps out of the role of an impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I guess.
If you're still looking for something, you can get to a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but it doesn't make me happy anymore.
I asked if he'd ever organise a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps give outlines of the beginning, middle and end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya began with a biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will cease to receive a salary.
The government thinks thousands of people get paid even after they left the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state was losing at least one million dollars a month (£700,000) on the salaries of non-existent employees and further abuse of official authority.
The government suspects that the salaries are still being placed on bank accounts after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, the BBC reporter from Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, reported.
All civil servants must attend identification centres in the next two weeks, where their data will be recorded biometrically, as stated in the Government's statement.
He also says that anyone who does not arrive without sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
"The designation of real public service employees will make this measure a significant contribution to its cost-effectiveness and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of suspicion of "conspiracy against the government."
The police department hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were arrested.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation into corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for alleged organizing a criminal gang and phone eavesdropping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the work of Islamic clergyman Fethullah Gulen against him and others in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
Not in all Ukraine is peace.
We must fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansko, visited by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children putting on embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC found the boss for a tough time.
He carries with him clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has her own experience in the front lines.
She started her career at the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Media World Pearsons.
For seven years, she was Executive Director of the Financial Times and resigned from her post when her junior colleague took up the highest position at Pearson's parent company.
Rumor has it that her severance package was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former CEO of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the government office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the director's work as a poison chalice.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of the hierarchy of its own BBC leadership, but also out to the public voice in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming to the company complex as a Chinese dynasty, decompose it, and thus rob himself of his job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and its status being revised.
As the competition circle expands and the new technology challenges old certainty, the immediate negotiations on licence fees for the BBC are in great danger.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each cost only 40p a day.
Moreover, the popularity of the BBC is evidently rising: to 53% of supporters compared to 31% ten years ago.
The BBC service models have changed: Today I see the headlines on my mobile phone and I can look at the shows I missed on the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve of an insulting tweet.
Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, published on Sunday, contained an insulting picture of a democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of authority.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous account.
A tweet that hasn't been authorized left my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer any questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who's really responsible for his administration.
Previous tweet published a non-flattering, humorous picture of State's Attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced in April 2013 for drunk driving.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which brought Perry, a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
The label on the tweet said: "I don't always drive with three times the level of alcohol in my blood above the permitted limit... but when I do, I'm gonna sue Governor Perry for calling me responsible. "
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by the Lehmberg office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the judge to oversee the case to dismiss the charges because the use of the law to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut off $7.5 million from the State Fund for Public Interest Detention, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection brought a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civil society activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it gets famous.
After finishing fifth place in the committee of his party during his 2012 presidential campaign in Iowa, Perry responded to speculation that he might be finished by tweeting his own picture of him running near the lake and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is back to normal.
One of London's most prominent developers warned that the housing market in southeastern England had "returned" to a normal level of activity.
Living in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread concern about the credit bubble caused the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of the developer's company for demanding Berkeley clients, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from the top in 2013 to the normal level of transactions." He adds that it provides a "stable environment for operation."
The London housing market was doing well during the fall because buyers from abroad flooded into the capital.
According to the cadastral office data, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% just last year, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley increased by about a fifth last year and climbed to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, it has not been so attractive for foreign buyers of London's property in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new real estate taxes and talk about the possible "table tax" that politicians came up with before the parliamentary elections of next May.
Last week, Foxtons, a London real estate agency, warned that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules on loans, would slow the pace of market growth in real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
The new Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages in July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced home prices to 3% on the basis of the fact that home prices have already started to fall, forecasting the increase in London property prices for 2015.
According to WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London's most expensive neighborhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, fell by a quarter each year.
Yet the demand for housing in Berkeley's capital was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sales to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location remained the same and thus the forward sale remained. "
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3 742 properties from the beginning of April to the end of April, almost a third more than before the 2007 crisis.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40% to £380 million, revenues by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before Pidgley's annual meeting, he said that he predicted that Berkeley's annual revenues would be in line with current market expectations.
The analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley stock stopped at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker posted naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence online
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th Academy Award.
The photos of Oscar Jennifer Lawrence leaked online because of a hacker who claimed to have "list" photos of hundreds of new actresses.
The spokesperson for "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "obvious violation of privacy."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker got photos that were originally posted on the 4chan image sharing server, allegedly thanks to the gap in the Apple iCloud Internet storage system. The alleged list of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim versus the rest of the world" Winstead on Twitter also criticized the act.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took in the privacy of our home years ago are happy with themselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice, known for the Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were real. On Twitter she said: "These supposed naked pictures of me are PodVRH, people."
It's better to shut it down even in the heat. *Apparent pun*.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the spokesperson for the pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs were genuine.
An extraordinary demonstration from Howard Jacobson's praising new novel on love and the letter "J"
They melted, that's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposing like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, complicated, violent, isolated, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
You let it happen in an instant.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was an early love affair, which, more than usual, promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of his life and may even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hair and a fickle heart from a village on a northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
South came with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the vans, the slugs were drooling on the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge cabbages.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and yet charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for Man Booker Prize 2014.
The selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat in long grass armchairs and held hands, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, undoubtedly tuned the public station, which supplied the region with comforting music and soothing messages, when the look on her tan crossed legs reminded him of the old song of a long forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to with his blinds closed.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they didn't play those songs on the radio anymore.
They weren't forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - they just weren't played.
They helped them get into the desuetude, as well as the very word desuetuto.
People's tastes have done what they could never do by regulations and outlaw status, and just as people, as far as books are concerned, choose memoirs where poor people become rich, chefs and romance novels, so ballads are chosen in music.
Kavern had himself torn down by the day and started playing the imaginary piano and singing serenade to Aillina's big feet with a rude, comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was the favorite song by the jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter "J" before he came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
Father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth when you started saying "J," it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny back then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard one.
Not even jazz, even though it wasn't directly outlawed, they didn't.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
When the tunes started, people wanted to know exactly where they were gonna end up.
Same for humor.
His unpredictableness got on people's nerves.
And jazz was humor expressed in song.
Although he hadn't heard from Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she couldn't remember a time when popular singers weren't black.
No laws, no pressure.
A loose society is one in which every part of it with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who have been happily spared by chance - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution fit for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from India's subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for no family being without a working phone.
The Poles left were plumbers, Greeks left, washing dishes.
Those of the Gulf States and Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country while what happened was happening when they were afraid that they would be accused of putting them in the fire, were actually afraid that the fire would be spent next time - they opened a restaurant where labneh was sold and smoked water pipes, did not draw attention to themselves and slowly digested them.
Everyone according to their talents.
Since she was only listening to ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could come out of the dirty words Kavern just sang to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"In fact, they are not rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from behind the soundproofed leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He meant to say it was a joke, but he hesitated to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"He thought she was funny," he said in the end.
She incredibly shook her head and overshadowed Keverne's view.
In the whole wide world, there was nothing but a mess of her raven hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," she said in doubt.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly the feet.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles right now," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to control the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from the couch, knocked down the radio and spilled the unfinished wine.
Bearless wine, so it wasn't the drinking that did it.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm sickly attracted to you for being an asshole," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she stood against him.
She thought she was gonna get hit?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that in the ground it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean splintered over them.
The same crazy men, after what happened, even more touchy and annoying than their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers, wandered madly from the pub to the pub, ready to lay their hands on any woman who dares to reject them or laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First cuddle her - to cuddle has become the most common term for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote of weak ballads about the love that spewed on the radio - first to polish her, then slap her.
In Kevern's opinion, too much cultivation, because cuddling itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a nonverbal indication to leave.
He got up from his cot like an old man.
She felt resentful herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if she was watching him from a window upstairs - a man caught up with what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart closed because of him and all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few beat her up.
A man turned away from her, his shoulders hung, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel like she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember a single moment until today that she had seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, an unstatutary monitoring system of Public moods, prepared a brief article on the persistence of light and moderate violent acts in areas where it was relieved or stopped, most expected to be eliminated if enough money and energy were spent.
"A lot has been done and a lot still has to be done," she wrote, "to calm the innate aggression of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the rugged, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of the church towers, the breath of human kindness rarely appeared historically over the hedges."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devouring unhappy stories, and proclaiming that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only does the old brutality stick as hard as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that there is new and aggressive intolerance at home, in workplaces, roads, and even in sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery," said her supervisor.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I need to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has once again turned to her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unconceived societies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is completely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment the way you have shown it.
Clearly, you yourself are biased towards the church - things you call "ruthless" and "brutal" others might also interpret as expressions of natural power and energy.
Still dealing with what happened when it happened, as if it had happened if it had happened, yesterday, it was preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head, the recommendations that Ofnow had been sending to the world for the last quarter of a century or more were blinking pinkly on the light board.
Smile for your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, make a deal, apologize.
Speaking is better than keeping quiet, singing is better than writing, but there's nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," said Esme Nussbaum quietly, when she was sure that her supervisor had finished, "and I no longer claim that the wound did not heal the way we imagined it would heal.
My concern, above all, is that if we are not notified in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened when it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the fingertips.
That was supposed to indicate infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when the steps they may have taken and perhaps did not make your grandparents, you describe them as mistakes.
You also go too far to talk about venting their "rage " and" distrust " on the "others. "
I shouldn't remind anyone in your place that we don't talk about "us" and "them" in the understanding of the past and in the protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we're honest with each other," Esme took courage, "no one is blameless.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to blame, there are no things that should be fixed, even if the remedy is appropriate and possible.
But what good is the past but to learn from it -
The past exists to make us forget it.
If there's anything I can add -
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged the fingertips.
"I will take your message into consideration," he said, and released her.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who rode on the sidewalk in a way that passers-by described as "brutal and furious."
Coincidences happen.
The Lesothian Kingdom Army claims that no coup is planning - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesoth deny that they would organize a coup to overthrow the government and claim to have acted against police suspects in an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says that the army has surrounded his official seat and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maser.
After declaring death threats, the Prime Minister and his family left for the neighboring Republic of South Africa.
The military spokesperson, Major Ntlele Ntoi, said it wasn't really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that police tried to arm themselves.
"This morning, Lesotha's command of the Defensive Forces acted after receiving several reports from the information service that several groups were in the ranks of the police planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make a mess in the country," said the Voice of America.
A spokesman for the South African government, Clayson Monyela, said that military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one claimed to have taken government power by force, the actions of the lesothic defense forces seem to bear a sign of a coup d'état," he said.
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesothus said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thaban said that in his view he was the target of an attack because of his efforts to combat corruption in the country.
There has been tension in Lesoth since Thabane suspended the parliamentary session due to internal disputes.
He claimed that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his actions by the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month minimum
The growth in production in the euro area slowed to 13 months, according to a closely monitored survey in August.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have decreased and the factories have damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures come from the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with delayed eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that Mario Draghi's director may have indicated this week that he is considering quantitative eurozone easing, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US joined during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect, which has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on producers, is becoming increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist Markit.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to 11 months minimum 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, and Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
Signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
Industrial slowdown is likely to add fuel to the fire to analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI has risen to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best you can say about August's production overview of shopping managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing. "
He added: Eurozone producers currently have a very difficult life because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has proven to have affected trade - particularly consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially expensive ones.
He stated that "even more likely" it would appear that the ECB would eventually have to perform some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited. "
Ten years of Hell Survivors from Beslan: Ten years since the horrors of the occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
During the suffering that lasted three days and shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We returned to Beslan to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
Exactly ten years after Beslan's terrifying cast, 334 people, including 186 children, died, were warned by survivors of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to tragedy brought the East and the West together, leading to action and the future in this disastrous disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, South Russia, to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
We found amazing young people who resisted disaster, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will live in them.
What's their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them die - should be over.
A girl trying to get back into a broken school gym.
She was captured by a leading Russian photographer, Dmitri Beliakov, only trying to climb back into the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in her underwear.
Confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and crawled back to find my mommy.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: "The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
There are pieces of shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said determinedly.
"It just happened to me, and it can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate Jera Gapova was killed there.
We used to play together when we were kids and imagined going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her capture, but memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture of myself climbing through the school window on the Internet, I think a lot of people will see her for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped by the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school at seven years old) and he survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At that time, a seven - year - old said: "My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand. "
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run."
He was afraid that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother was dead. "
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in the hospital with her leg hurt, thinking that her son had died.
After they met again, she said: "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the lost News of the World newspaper), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell the memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play computer games that shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember kids I used to play with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London well, especially when I could pick anything I wanted at the toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine where he suffers as much as he and his friends suffer because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such a terrible time," says Damir, who took part in volunteering at the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
One day I want to work with the police, and I hope I'll be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 says: "They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no kids screaming and running around, and the silence lasted for months.
She remembers her way to London live with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and how they could express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damiro.
I remember when Damir was in the mood for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them from a water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
And that was only a month from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of kids are going to be killed and killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir's grown up and he's a nice, quiet kid, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he hates to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and from time to time, he goes to the gym and lights candles.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying on a couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he threw away all his guns or other weapons to play with.
I can hardly believe for hours I was sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I came to my senses after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember screaming, "Damir, run, run!" but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go further than others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose picture after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Comfort: Survivors from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, on the right Grigory today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was engraved in his bloody face.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and hurried to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists invaded the yard, so my little boy stayed there alone for three days," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's getting harder to think about and talk about.
There's not gonna be a day that goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: The photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I learned that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of a crying Grigory in San Marin.
Grigory doesn't like to look at that picture, and we keep it hidden in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that because of this picture, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: "It's important that this doesn't happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the crash of Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is about to get very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, then how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little bit, he needs decades.
It had an effect on my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of an attack, but then things got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why when September 1st comes, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is history.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was underway, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
Now I'm older, and they say that children can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I went to a psychologist and it made me feel a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year after that - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'm never going back in there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in this well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photograph taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally now.
But I still couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in St Petersburg because of my health.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My next thing is animals, so I got on the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows."
He said: "I know I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something the kids should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "The pain will always be here.
He's inside, and he's getting worse with his anniversary coming up.
I'm going to take part in the commemorative ceremony.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregorij's an adult today, but he's carrying on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so horribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's over 50% of the horror, but he can't get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and it only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and that were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but I'm in pain of losing the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who didn't remarry.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost popped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We've been a friendly country in the past, so how did we get to fight each other now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could pick up all these rebels and throw them away as far away as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took a special commando to safety
Saved: Alyona Tskaeva carries to a secure Russian special commando (left).
Now she's ten (on the right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all
In 2004, the world caught its breath when a Russian policeman took little Alyon in his arms from the Beslan captivity.
Terrorists released her, but in captivity in the school gym, they kept her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhara.
Makhar, who was three years old at that time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and she and her new wife Svetlana have a little girl named Kristina after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that "he is a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children. "
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that commemorate the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in underwater shooting or shooting, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes the exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you do that, find out how deep you can dive in with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in both normal and waterproof versions.
Always take a few shots - a lot of them don't work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, but the outdoors don't have them.
Even if you have LCD, under water it will be difficult to see and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more shots.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure variances, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive of light, it decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's excellent advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the damper light.
This is particularly important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you have to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality could change things even into a huge organization like the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the sick from the pain caused by sickness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that maimed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He was dealing with flu symptoms and found himself impatient and his wife, Juliet, included remorse.
He noted: "I want everything to happen sooner than later. "
When Juliet left for the week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague took a chest X-ray.
One two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or the lining of the lungs.
Most cancers find it difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But Mesothelioma is different.
Almost all cases cause exposure to asbestos - building fibrous material previously referred to as "miracle " but today it is known to be deadly.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry entered into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as isolation treasurers, builders, carpenters, and workers in shipyards.
The toxin used in industry in another era now seems difficult to be a cause for concern.
But such smugness is not appropriate.
As it turns out, there is a mesothelioma epidemic in Britain today.
The number of deaths on the mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year from this disease are twice the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we are only now experiencing its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The mesothelioma disaster is not just about the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases he is still, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
So Mesothelioma does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged bastions from London's department stores to public schools do not constitute shelter.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage sites of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even lay down isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors, and doormen - used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question that he was able to answer partially.
"Of the four doctors who were practicing at Guy's Hospital and who then showed up in the past five years mesothelioma," he remarked in his letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are gonna get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55 years old.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now all we can do is repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are going to get sick with the same disease? "
According to the leading British mesothelioma expert at Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that some 90,000 people die between 1970 and 2050 when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
As the case files from the archives of the courts, often referred to and called for settlement, show how much the mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she had neglected to expose Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised the clothing section in two stores - one of the locations was the company's flagship, an Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
He's got two kids in his 20s today.
"Before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, barely knowing anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed he might have anything to do with me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
His name was given to him by his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in the construction industry.
Today, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
Yet, it is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO consider it a "great health risk" that can cause death.
But more dangerous is brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (stepsdolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that "there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]. "
Marsh & Spencer's employee was exposed to asbestos at an Oxford Street flagship store in London.
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that "a significant part of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely due to exposure to asbestos in the environment. "
A significant part of this exposure is due to "normal use and ventilation' of buildings.
No one seems to be sure she's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even those in the middle of the government may not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that service lifts and pipes behind the Parliamentary Committee rooms are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be damaged by something as harmless as the "strong air current."
Ministers are often accused of only caring for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's services directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace be given a "good medical certificate," it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed for Parliament to be thoroughly examined, to modernize electricity and to remove asbestos, and that, after the elections in 2015, Members will sit on green benches in Westminster rather than on the premises of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Centre.
Goddard's report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations. "
It is not possible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
All they can do now is wait.
One of the persons who have never been able to determine when asbestos exposure occurred is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that asbestos was exposed to work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven, " she says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was conquered by something like chills.
He was 45, he was at night, and he was in the middle of surgery.
I suddenly shook up.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't driving home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from a contusion, a lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
Eventually, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent for analysis from his lungs.
Still, they didn't diagnose.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after exercising and breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to the O.R. with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not associate anything with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and at work he got into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted his CT scans and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of the lungs.
I'm optimistic.
I tend not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
Biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year's Eve: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started seeing sisters at the Macmillan charity, and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It has been shown that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipe," he says.
In people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest itself.
Mesothelioma, therefore, is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have a risky profession.
The most dangerous pipes of heat-insulated asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, staff members who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with toxic substances.
As it turns out, several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients' lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is being removed to this day.
The pupils built Bunsen's Kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulation and non-flammable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students built Bunsen's burner on an asbestos pad.
There have been websites dealing with asbestos issues in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his suit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman with mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s when she was tearing down the garden house.
So be careful how you break down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes you a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was moving from doctor to patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I've been told 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna see Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer to kill.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos make tiny fibers.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in a pleura, a lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can induce cell mutation.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were probably exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and "the breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
Its nature has been invasive from the very beginning.
The mesothelioma routine therapeutic options used for other types of cancer do not work so much.
For example, it is heated to discuss the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say she'd be worth a shot.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer "does not respond much to chemotherapy " which, although" has an effect, " does not heal.
"Sometimes there is someone who will survive lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould's author died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after Graham Abbott's own diagnosis, he's still fighting.
After discovering the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advisor to the same disabled people.
When they called, he cheerfully said, "Hello, you've reached the head office of cancer."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would probably extend his life by just a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson "was able to show things in a more optimistic light. "
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the sternum surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they checked me out," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request and they would have to approve his payment.
In order to get the best treatment available, the question of money is crucial to patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments ultimately fail, many patients face additional financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why he's turning to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960 ' s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that mesothelioma was due to asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating the case, however, the spokesman Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the asbestos in the incriminate basement was removed in the 1990s. "
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
The exposure of deadly asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or failed.
Insurance records are missing.
And those who now resist charges have time on their side, which their plaintiffs certainly don't.
In response to this fact, important new legislation has been approved this year, which makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to claim compensation even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve to be paid by the insurance company, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally allocate to them as compensation - approximately £120,000.
Every year 300 successful requests are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, think that £350 million is "good work."
"It is an agreement drawn up by insurance companies for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they hadn't intervened in time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to track down former employers and sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps. "
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given seven deaths each year, it was necessary to act quickly.
"People suffer too much, and they need help now," Penning said last December during the second reading of the Mesothelioma law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast survival rates of up to 40% of patients for five years.
Abbott was strengthened.
"That, of course, is not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March 2012.
He completed the last of six chemo cycles at the end of August.
The inspection showed no signs of disease.
I went to the next checkup in March [2014].
I had a few stains of [cancer] in my chest.
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It's not life-threatening.
He's into it.
Abbott had six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think of practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how an alarm clock works on a boiler.
When you get the bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
Like Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After my diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients face such talks.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not lightened by hope or merely a hint of survival.
The disease brings (and finally brought Stephen Jay Gould) unhappy confidence.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma doesn't endanger life."

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
Despite the growing discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will trigger long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists have begun to organize and prepare for just a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it made us angry," said the legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong were lying.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the Li Fei National People's Congress said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's elections would cause "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong's administration to China, Beijing has promised that, starting in 2017, citizens will be able to vote for executive power.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders are firmly in control of the nomination process of a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be acceptable.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of Hong Kong's largest and most watched protests in several years.
Most pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are supported by the Central occupation movement with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal voting rights.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy movement gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks they would start waves of protests.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their Internet statement, the organizers said that the movement "has only weighed the occupation of the Centre as a last step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice left.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the cast of the Centre is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and have strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters on Sunday and have deployed policemen and barricades.
According to many Hong Kong residents, rioting is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The surge of people from the mainland increases competition in the area of products and services.
There are also fears that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Central occupation movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - Hong Kong's lifeboat.
"The protest he is talking about could cause much more economic damage by how many people will participate and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to see the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
In recent days, China's state media has also come up with reports portraying democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive Western-controlled agents.
During the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which came to 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
Pre-election grudge?
The League in Jihlava wears a title according to the political movement
A small soccer is played by some 1,600 amateur athletes in the regional town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is newly called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after a movement that goes into the October municipal elections.
Moreover, the head of the small football in Jihlava Jan Mráka is the tenth on his list.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," Mráka said.
The situation around the first league of small football has already been dealt with by Jihlava City Hall lawyers and recommended a change in the system of distribution of subsidies.
The small soccer team won around a million crowns last year according to the city's website.
This year, too, it's worth hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the procedure of a small football is not contrary to the law or the guidelines of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to adjust the rules on grant allocation and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, spokesperson for the City Council.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time express as little football support in the elections of one political party, I don't think that's possible anymore.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the Highland "big" football.
That the ČSSD regional championship, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and competitions like that?
I wouldn't be up for it.
On the contrary, I would like to be approached by corporate sponsors," said Miroslav Vrzáček, Chairman of the Regional Football Association.
The head of small football won't let another party and the movement into the league name
According to players of small football this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own complex with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and bathrooms.
"For example, the field on Stoupách is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ondřej Lapeš from the club Starlet Jihlava.
The best location would be Český mlýn.
However, there will be a nonsense area for skateboarders, which is about 50 in Jihlava," Mráka said.
Mayor Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small football field uses artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build such playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build sports sites for schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think that huge progress has been made for a small soccer team over the last few years," he said.
According to Jan Mrák, other political parties in the name of the league will not appear.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us in partnership, we don't put another in the partnership," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider this at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall committee for sport.
"But whether the voters assess whether Mr Mráka is using the Little Jihlava Soccer Association and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jet aircraft
We are pleased that we can respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said that the service has its own security site.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the country in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important freshman) variants this year students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
The company spokesperson said that since the services had just started, they have no reservations yet, but he added: "Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks. "
The company also stated that although students pay an annual tuition of £9,000, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and VIF is exactly the right way to do it.
But the National Union criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, observed: "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students entering the university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before they throw thousands of pounds away for something as simple as getting to college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with rising costs of basic needs.
After the Ferguson events, feminists oppose the racism and behaviour of the police
At the beginning of the month, an unarmed young man was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
Presents waiting for a funeral with their hands up chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, for shooting an unarmed young man named Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in white feminists' online discussions.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equality of income, white feminists prefer sex over race.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the white woman's reaction is 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the 9th August shooting, personal articles with titles such as "thinking white women over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about suppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privileges at such a level," she said.
People felt they had to express themselves about what happened.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially exclusive that they had to draw attention to it.
According to a professor of English at Ohio State University, Korithy Mitchell, Ferguson has brought to light problems that African-American women face every day and which are not perceived as "female issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish funny stories on Facebook with my partner and get 150 likkas from people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the coloreds being trapped in their own country, it's quiet deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who dealt with the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no question of race or gender of dichotomy.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of sharing these problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the question of race and sex in mainstream feminist circles is now being merged by white women, Angela Hattery, professor of women's question and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of white rape," Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed cooperation from a white woman.
According to Hattery, a split between white women and black women came when an electoral campaigner like Susan B. Anthony examined the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet cards on voting rights for women and to focus on the right for black people later," Hattery explained.
If we realize this, we'll get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped Negroes protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained electoral rights in 1920, it took ten years to organize themselves against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the questions that Ferguson raised - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "conquer" the questions that black women faced generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists on these premises [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" Mitchell raised.
The second wave of feminists who have made their careers by fighting for reproductive law and access to contraception now discovers what that means.
Major feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where Rebecca Carroll's column from the Guardian was published, demanding white Americans to protest more strongly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different, yet similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions on race that differ significantly in opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for intersectal feminism, which involves racial and gender issues, her comments on the question of race in America confuse some people.
A specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who Stolen Feminism?", said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "more vulnerable than their sisters," but notes by Steinem's Ferguson's parties face criticism that she has raised earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a little My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young Negroes and Hispanics, many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reactions.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes at the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied youths in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of immigration legislation reform was once again raised - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercad, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to raise the question as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," says Mercado.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a response in women's organizations," she said.
Residence of pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed a picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it rested in the living room of the pig.
A one-bedroom separate house, which is for sale for £120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the sofa of the pig.
Connells' real estate agency said that the pig in the photograph is the owner's pet.
"The photo found itself there by mistake and was therefore removed," said the spokesperson of the office.
In the property information, Connells described the former house of prayer as "the only single one-bedroom house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked if the pig is included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There's a search for a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, and a lucky guy takes $1.1 million home from his Saturday lottery tour.
Harvey's trucks were lucky for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 was a $1 million prize.
But the lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Steve Forward's shop owner said the whole town in the southwest of Perth is talking about winning.
It's the main topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one win last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires, and only a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
Harvey Millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totaling $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which he deliberately chose time outside the traffic peak.
With the time chosen, the GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend on the railway on the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people commuting for work during the day," said the trade union on Monday morning in a press release for a strike.
"Our first strike should hit mainly freight transport, less already passengers," added GDL.
DB has not yet published an official response to the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international railway connections, among other things with the Czech Republic.
The unions demand a five per cent increase in engine drivers' wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours a week.
Currently, the average salary of the engineers is between EUR 36,000 and EUR 46,000 (CZK 998,000 and CZK 1.27 million) per year depending on the years worked.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
The DB refuses to accept wage increases in reducing working time.
In doing so, they stress that the driver's wage assessment must evolve in the same way as the other railway staff, for which DB does not count on shortening the working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start on fire.
That's why he ended up at the Barum Rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a defect in the material.
The car was brand-new, so I didn't even think anything like that would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be repaired temporarily and continued at a slower pace to the service, where would the mechanics replace it?
If we'd headed straight there, yes.
But we still had two more Erzets, and we couldn't.
It's got a high temperature, and the risk of the car burning was high.
I can't afford that.
You've done five speed trials at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, and I didn't go over the vintage.
Everything was caused by the fact that we drank the car for more than six months to be on some level.
The race showed we did it.
You started it so that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
Work didn't go to waste.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not show up.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, tech said no.
You weren't the only one who stepped out of the fight for the first time.
The foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi also fell out.
Were you surprised that so many favorites resigned?
Yes.
Especially for the audience, it was a shame because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are preparing the car, moved to the top for a long time.
But he paid to fly off the track and take up almost two minutes' manko.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could've repeated the winners' grades.
It was the first second time.
But even Mira confirmed that the car was well prepared.
He was driving really fast.
You reported the end of your career exactly a year ago, yet you showed up at the Barum Rally launch.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular Rally Racer?
Definitely not at the moment.
Last year I said that Barumka was my last race and I still didn't keep it.
I've decided to go again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I guess I'll do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people got to the track just for you.
Does that please you?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What do you expect from Barumka?
The team's moving on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't do too much damage here.
Plus, he wants to borrow the Fabia of Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
Mira and I have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to get things ready for next year.
Can you give me a hint?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally belonged to the World Cup, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Doesn't it tempt you to try out the tracks there again?
He's not.
Oral agreement with an employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you didn't get a doctor's certificate of incapacity to work, which serves as evidence for the organization that you can't perform work duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify your employer.
The agreement subsequently took place that the given days would be registered as a vacation, but the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent to receive leave confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has proved to be successful.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the taking of leave, as in your case, may be denied and absent from work assessed as a long-term unforgivable absence, thus a reason for immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute over the agreement with your employer, you are so lacking evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with § 53, only you have given the given days in the credit sheet as an unforgivable absence.
Unforgivable absence in the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the impossibility of taking material security in unemployment), yet the possibility of finding a new job is difficult.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have it confirmed in writing that there was an accident, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called "incapacity"; it is only a medical certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can present this document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issuing of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work or the early notification of the employer or the request of written consent to the taking of leave.
This will avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on return to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just behind half the racetrack of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence for the second time after his right front tire burst in the 172nd round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart drove a damaged car into the garage, didn't say anything to the reporters and left.
The head of his team Chad Johnston said that Team 14 is disappointed, but will now focus on the Richmond race, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have better performance and better conclusion," said Johnston.
We're gonna go to Richmond and hope we're doing better there.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the first time in a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
"We were hoping for a good ending in today's race," said Johnston, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up on the spot in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who got in the way of Stewart during the race.
Authorities said that investigating the cause of the accident would last at least another two weeks.
So far, Stewart hasn't decided whether to face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm cheering before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked his way to 10th and then even to 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, with Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, drove out of the other corner and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars into the fence.
Stewart continued, but he withdrew to 21st place.
Prague has selected a new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedures for the new taxi station manager.
For 103 parking spaces, it earns approximately CZK 12.3 million a year.
Until recently, she collected 150,000 crowns a year for the same cab drivers.
Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09) informed about this.
Previously, the city used lottery to select managers.
The winner then obtained a lease for a lump sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the tender is currently decided.
"The year after the termination of the original lease contracts and the opening of the tendering procedures has proved that the new rental system is far more advantageous and fairer overall for Prague," the councilman claims.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýna
The highest price was offered by interested people for a post in Na Perštýně street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million each year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by new administrators for seats outside the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules of taxi rentals were adopted by the councillors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year the original lease agreements were terminated.
The selection procedures were held in four waves and 29 sites were found by the new administrator.
We had to clean the well for the second time this year.
We let it all out every time, creating practically a second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo in.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the basement has always provided enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't exactly professionally done, Grandpa drained her with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was just on three circles and overall peculiar, like everything else at the cabin, but like I said.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it didn't seem like the water smelled right.
We were wondering if something fell.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a little bad luck, there the board did not quite reach, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing visible in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky package on the floor with some dice on it.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further away.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
By the ceiling, where the vents, Grandpa's invention, were leftovers of fish!
And heavy!
Our basement is unique, too.
Some would say Grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
Walls and floors are just suffocated sand, only the ceiling is smashed.
It's mostly boats.
And the wheels.
And sun loungers for the beach.
The door with wide gaps was mostly open, as someone went there all the time.
Several above mentioned vents at the ceiling.
No net, so birds fly there and build nests on the beams.
It's useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be exhilarating, and that's what he wanted.
Now, of course, even the luft didn't help.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We threw away the things that were around: boards, heraclit plates, that sort of thing.
Our cottage was greeted remotely by passersby by disinfectant odor.
We were wondering, who could have pulled the disgusting leftovers in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She'd hardly come over to our place to eat.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite okay.
Didn't Franta put the disgusting stuff in the vent?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, he has.
We decided to guard the basement and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Dragging water out of a forest well isn't something I'd like to do for a long time.
We heard a terrible anxious bark from our bitch once.
My mom looked out of the balcony and saw a strong black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Réza jumped over her and squealed like crazy.
My mom scolded her because she thought Réza had dug up the garbage hose from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose got partially tangled into the ball and partially straightened out.
The balcony was hissed.
Réza had a hysterical attack.
We ran downstairs.
A sneaker, well over three feet long and fat as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Réza was holding her back.
It was unclear whether she wanted to save the toad or whether she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw an outnumber in the form of our whole family, she probably thought we'd eat it when we were so hungry, and she snuck through the vent into the basement.
We followed her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind a well.
By the way, we recorded another stinking package on her record.
Smells like a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new safety around the pump was a bit of a slop.
And we locked the basement during the day.
Maybe...
We went out, and there we all went down to one vent.
We didn't wait long.
The well's a mess.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole gecko went up to the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to come in.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops and sold them to the company.
A disheartened employee after his release bought computers on the company and then sold them.
He spent the money he received before the police were arrested.
Within a short period of time, a man bought a total of 16 computers in twelve cases for more than 200 thousand crowns.
"After taking over, he took the notebooks to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," said Chief Commissioner Rostislav Brückner of Šumper Police.
The motive of fraud was revenge on the employer for his release and also for the profit of money.
"In the interrogation, he told us that he used the money to repay the loans," Brückner said.
Police also found that a con man is a pathological player who repeatedly treated himself in a psychiatric hospital.
The money could have ended up in the winning machines or in the video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money on him," said the Commissioner.
A crook who has been punished for theft once is now facing a prison sentence of between one and five years.
The cops have not yet told us whether there is a threat of punishment to the bazaars that bought the laptops under the price and kept selling them.
"It is true that they were taking over brand new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
None of the bazaar owners have yet been charged.
Come on, a little more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year the organizers have prepared some changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route that brought the target to the waterfall, instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race along with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally greet our readers at the stand where we took pictures together and filmed videos.
To draw my view from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
My friend Katya and I were obediently placed at the end of the corridor from 60 to 70 minutes before the start.
We said hello to our friends who walked past us to the faster runners sector.
There wasn't much time left.
Couple of warm-ups, start sports, countdown and start!
The cheering screams, but instead of a quick start, followed by a dip to the starting line.
After five minutes, we go to the gate, I turn on the measurements, and we start at an hour ten.
We intersect with a yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far they all look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost up to a kitsch touch.
Pulsating meat stretching along the embankment looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre traditionally begins to show who has the strength.
A light hill on Palacky Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before the transition to Theatre, I see a police escort and Vítek Pavlista is following him at an incredible pace to the finish.
I hear the admirable sighing of other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, encouraging him, he's going to high-five me, but right before that, my leg will sprain, and our hands will just miss.
The Theatre Street run gives you a chance to relax and breathe.
Need to be, there are places ahead where the views will blow my breath.
The turn on Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my feet are almost on my own.
Behind the first refreshment, there are moments of truth.
At the crossing of Katya's road, he stumbles over the curb and shows off the ski jump.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It is one of the narrowest places on the track, but there is no such rush at this stage of the race, but there is still a need to keep a close eye on the surroundings.
I don't know yet that the concept of the narrowest place gets its true meaning later.
Behind the Dusty Gate, we are encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I'm advising Kata, because ten claps with fans are like half an energy bar.
It's really working, we're speeding up again, and even though we've fallen quite heavily, now the fighter ride has begun.
We're outrunning dozens of runners, when I pass someone particularly tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, a little more, you can do it!"
Nobody's getting ahead of us after the last snack, we're speeding up.
So far, we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but it really needs to be done.
The sun has already set and the end of the day symbolically closes the race.
Last run on the bridge, turn and just straight to the finish line.
The pace we're running, I'm amazed at where this girl's coming from?
"Come on, we're going under 13 hours, we're working!" I'm calling.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
One hour 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can I do?
Coach set the limit for an hour 20.
So seven minutes below schedule.
Which is a great result.
Right behind the target, Kate's legs are breaking, and I'm helping her to the railing where she's resting for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well done performance.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of target space.
Euphoria doesn't let us think about pushing through the dressing rooms.
It's obvious here that Goat Aisle wasn't the narrowest place.
That's where we're headed for a swimmer that's under the brink of nearly 10,000 runners packed to burst.
If anyone doesn't like crowds, it's no place for them.
After a while, I'm losing my head and wondering if the beautiful views and the more interesting route, compared to the last few years, were worth what's going on at the finish line.
I know from my own experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If 10,000 people join this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year's route change showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
Excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Spa was transferred between the runners and the race itself.
Organizers around the track as well as random viewers escalated it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, during the urban run of the historical centre, there must be obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of a mass race in a place that is bounded on one side by a wall and on the other by a river to be the best solution.
If I say the race is over by running the target, I think it's a very good one.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but everything turned out okay.
Write to us in the discussion whether you liked the route and what you're saying about the situation at the finish line.
Prison guards in Bulgaria are organizing protests
Hundreds of prison officials throughout Bulgaria attended a national protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their request to re-establish the original working conditions that have recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov, includes higher salaries.
The overseers symbolically protested the new working hours of the month and demanded a return to the original twenty - four - hour shifts.
Although the prison guards' unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) informed.
"The negotiations are still ongoing," said BNR Head of the General Directorate of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Workers' Trade Union Organizations at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of the prison service staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University hit a black one in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to break into the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today - an attempt to unite two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity theory.
One reason for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that it is not a boring story in the case of searching for a unified physical theory.
The physics fundamental problem between two key theories (for at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) was solved and solved so imaginatively that it was worth telling even laymen.
In addition, Greene coped with the complex material so freshly and captivatingly that he cannot be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
Moreover, he corrected his "mistake " mostly in the next two books: The Structure of the Universe and the Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author wouldn't object if his book became obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the elegant universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with ambition should understand the world's importance to this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will still be a little more lively in this area (need to say that the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Greene without violence the doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
Surely the idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strange, or mystic.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes away from the universe as a whole to something more groundless, namely a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine stretching a hundred-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from a half-mile distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long hose stretched in a horizontal direction, but if you don't have a sharp vision, you hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you answer it only with one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a half-mile distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we expand everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle waving a hose.
In such an enlarged view it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension after the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of clockwise movement" around the circular section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you have to enter two numbers: how far away it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle waving the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note. Experts will note that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of strings.
He discusses non-disturbing aspects in chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow, is short and rolled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimensions of the hose wrapping circuit are short, "spooled" and worse noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
The example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
That they divide into two groups.
They can either be large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, rolled up and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not just beat ourselves up to uncover the "wrapped" dimension of the hose thickness.
All you had to do was get a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only reveal the coiled dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his article in which he came up with the amazing idea that space geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by providing an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this observation of Kaluz goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and rolled dimensions.
This means that, like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize at any moment.
But by analogy with the circular circuit of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, firmly rolled into space so tiny that they have remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the nature of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a little while longer.
Imagine drawing a relatively dense series of circles on the circumference of the hose in black color.
The hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With a telescope, the drawing will reveal the coiled dimension even easier, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, which combined four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little bit, let us note the illustration in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space similar to that of the hose surface.
Each following level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe may have an additional dimension (seeing them on the fourth level of magnification) if the rolls are small enough space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square network represents the commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle represents a new, tiny and rolled dimension.
Just like strings of threads in a densely woven carpet, even these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we only drew them into intersections in a square network because of their graphics.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of the space - the ordinary world around us - in such common measures as meters, illustrated by the side of a small square in a square network.
In each picture below, focus on a small area of the picture before; enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, if we go beyond the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we will suddenly see a new circle of a coiled dimension similar to a looped thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions similar to the hose of the circular circumference at each point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have only drawn the circular dimension in some, regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 of Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry summarizes.
Similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also record important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
The more important difference is that we're talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional round dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - is much harder than to see the apparent, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be beyond the power of our most modern enlargement tools.
But most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a round bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration falsely suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and perpendicular) each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position we would need four figures, apart from the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.
Are you intrigued?
Brian Greeen's elegant universe can be purchased here on books.idnes.cz.
Price for e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional crappy dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment can detect the structures of a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can barely observe smaller rolled-up dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with a few ideas from the just-born quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could be about one Planck length, which is far beyond the discernment of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohn Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: Episode 5
The whole essence of "twelfth" lies in a twelve-tactic harmonic form, which you can freely repeat.
He who gropes in the music theory finds its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola, a.k.a. Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
An educational puppeteer and puppeteer whose facebook profile can be tracked here has been living like a graphic designer since graduation 20 years ago.
He is a guitar player of the band Wohne, which is said to be impossible to leave from.
The guitarist is from his father, like Brother Matìj, Wohn's leader.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, you just apply it to the harmonic model of the 12," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza do what you can do with a 12-track harmony on two strings and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you put on the third string, you can already flirt with some tunes.
When you finally add the fourth, be careful to change the tune, Honza warns in the video.
The next time Honza goes back to pentatonic, you'll try to get her together with a 12-year-old.
So practice her honestly.
As best you can read in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school games on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, it's for Hradecký Dvořák
We take the point, and we're happy for him.
We, the second landlord, had more chances for the first half," said the assailant, who scored this time from the penalty kick.
You weren't nervous when he played, but he was accompanied by a huge whistling?
I wasn't particularly aware of it, although the second goal, where there are domestic fans, would probably be worse.
You evened the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal out of the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the beginning, we were passive, we came from the corner and then the penalty.
After that, you got up, and the first half, you were a better team with more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the scored goal until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the game going, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the landlords said something about their play during the break, I guess they weren't too happy with it.
The first time you scored on the opponent's field, maybe you haven't even gotten a goal at home.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's that different, it's more about us dealing with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was wrong of us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
Four games you've been waiting for a goal, weren't you worried it might be similar after the last game?
I hope not, but of course we're glad we haven't had to listen to talk about waiting for a goal since the last game.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which isn't for a big celebration yet.
Iceland - lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
The lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a kilometer away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This is what worries scientists the most...
The situation remains constant for now.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies from the fissure approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
Scientists, however, fear that the lava tunnel could be opened even where it is under the ice.
Moreover, if this were to happen, with a similar intensity to the current eruptions, it would mean a huge flood, both on the Jökulsá a Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is a strong smell of sulphur, from the crack rising clouds of steam and gases.
This is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with Fimvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also many more gases," says Vulcanologist Armann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
The traces of a sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
The orange level (second highest) for Bárðarbunga and yellow (third) for Askja applies to air operations.
The skies over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on her wings.
Flight day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, an air acrobat Peggy Walentin introduced herself, who in flight climbed from the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the double deck and also between the wings.
There it is dependent only on the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb took place for the fifth time this year and organizers managed to prepare several interesting aerial pieces again.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking on wings" by the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or plane Beechcraft 18.
He brought attention to himself with his shiny cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the USA.
After World War I, so many former war pilots tried to get through.
But due to a large number of fatal injuries, it was banned.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the program of flight days.
Peggy comes out of the cockpit on the top wing after takeoff.
That's where he plays all kinds of exercises.
Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where the show continues," said Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the area with Grippens Army of the Czech Republic in hinge (so called numbers).
Such a lineup could be seen for the first time by air fans in the Czech Republic.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with the aircraft from 1945.
It was made during the war, but he probably never attended it.
He was included in the army reserves.
Since 1963 he has worked in the civilian sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiště.
The same place is also another pearl of Cheb Air Day, a two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was no way to miss a massive machine at the airport.
His polished aluminum cover shone to the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in French air force has also won admiration.
A small transport plane caught off guard for a disavowed Turbolet and a part of the German delegation came from Hofu on an air day.
The German neighbors demonstrated in Cheb with reconstructed aircraft Jak 18T or three-member formation of biplanes Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
At least for tonight, Lucie Borhy traded her parenting worries for the work.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde host obviously doesn't know any of it.
Because she was good at channeling TV news, as if she hadn't stopped for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended on a six-day basis, where women are under the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not show up regularly in TV Nova's main news session.
The regulatory return is not until a month from now, according to Blesk.cz.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her now more than TV viewers.
Lucie Borhy came back on TV, and it was a hit.
Exhibition in Prague in a year?
The hall would sell out, plans to bachelor party Jágr
It would be dignified if something like this had been done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands up to it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the gorgeous Nagan team reunited.
Even the players who participated in the gold hat trick.
Players would have a taste, wouldn't they?
Absolutely.
It would simply be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they can be found during the tournament for one or two days, when it's a full day off, and where you could throw a match like that.
We'll tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Bed Šcherban (Jihlava Fight organizer) who would be in charge of this...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
Well, if I'm flying in...
You don't want to play in representation.
Or did the Jihlava meeting alter your decision?
Representations and exhibition matches are two different things and the performances are decisive in the representation.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who can do it, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagan reunion?
It was just the meeting with the players that was great.
You've come to life with stories and lots of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the tribute to Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey game and the fact that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmanek on the bench.
Do you still remember your first team match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, joined in one three.
For all of us, it was the first representative start.
Well, there's no way to say that we're dominating in any way.
In Jihlava after a long time caught Dominik Hašek.
What did you think of his performance?
I'm never surprised by Hashan on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jágra for the reasons why he decided to end up in the representation).
Even the Dildo was doing a great job.
You were with me one night to train, and there was a hole in it.
And now he's been catching up with a lot of fancy.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, soccer players begin to qualify
On Monday morning, prominent guests attended the Smichov NH Hotel.
People could see, for example, goalie Petr Bohemia from Chelsea, representative coach Pavel Vrba...
And over there, the figure in the black cap, it's Tomáš Rosický!
Backer Arsenal and captain of the team arrived at a reunion around 11:30 p.m. among the last.
We're going to have a nice fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said, when he had already presented himself in front of the press in the representation kit.
Czech representation programme
Monday September 1st: start of the reunion, first training
Tuesday September 2nd: Training open for fans (18:30, Letná) Autographs (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of the meeting
Rosický a spol. can support fans before Wednesday's match against the USA (20:15).
The representation opened for them Tuesday's training, which starts at 6:30 p.m.
And he will be followed by a book signing that Rosický and Bohemia will not miss.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be more peaceful.
Which is commended by Coach Vrba, who was complaining about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to rehearse things that haven't been so long," said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech football representation will be accompanied by the Musketeer's image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three games under Vrba, all prepped.
She tied 2:2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's just now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they managed to do a rehearsal against the US.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We need to think about being successful," said Willow.
The only player of the 23-member nomination with health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
His temperature's bothering him.
If he hadn't recovered until Wednesday's game against the U.S., Coach Willow would have called one more attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she was going to die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teens believing that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK's charity said that bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about diseases.
In the United Kingdom, approximately 23,000 people suffer from CMT, which may manifest symptoms in the area of motor skills such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
In the affected patients, numbness or pain may also occur, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's Fa - a disease that had a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be tied to a wheelchair, and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day and everything took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboard with other children and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was 13 years old and she was after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor's leaving the room, and looked into her documentation, where she learned she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When they answered my question, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the time I was 18, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my powers.
I was on my own, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk did not deteriorate as much as she expected, asking her surgeon.
He just stood up and hugged her and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it's gonna be something much less life-threatening."
After passing several genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a fortune child," she said.
CMT UK has launched a month of CMT awareness to draw attention to this disease.
Washington businessmen: taxes are being raised with the turn of the economy
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxation of firms in a country with accelerated economic recovery increased slightly last year and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia together for the fiscal year 2013 made $27.6 billion into government and local treasury, which is 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - increased by 4.3% last year to $ 671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and it was the third growth year in succession after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation political group, state taxes increased by 4.3%, compared to local contributions, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, shows in proportion the smallest tax revenue from the business.
Researchers argue that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which increased property taxes this year after three consecutive years with an increase of -1% by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from major states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Voriginia last year paid over $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not so much drive up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., real estate tax represents almost half the state and local taxation.
"Maryland owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organizations that don't pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
A recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed only to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, revenue from business seems to be increasing as well.
Companies in this region have published a corporation income tax of $2.3 billion, which has increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised one billion dollars in corporate income taxes, mostly in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national average level, to 4.3%, while Maryland growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the tax increase below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest tax on corporate income from all three districts (all of which have the same taxation), 6%.
The rate of taxation of companies in Maryland is 8,25%, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, to 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the US Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the State continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the statutory rate of income taxation could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small entrepreneurs in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax paid by small businessmen as a personal income tax - the cost increase compensation structure by increasing prices, according to which most companies are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% to 2.4 billion dollars last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and the national increase in trade tax will probably continue next year, the total revenue from sales for both state and local governments will increase to 6.2% in the same period last year.
Washington, however, may lag behind others because the reduction in government spending takes its toll on the labour market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafata's scissors will be Europe's boss
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novoruska
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the southeast of Ukraine, where government forces have been colliding with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
According to him, the support given to the West by the wars of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine contradicts democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kiev, so he cannot tell when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic has the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with its diplomats within the week, is to propose the form of a further tightening of anti-Russian sanctions, decided the EU summit tonight.
Journalists have been told by the permanent chairman of Herman Van Rompuy Member State meetings.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to shift the form of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuy will be replaced in December
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the head of the European Council, the so-called EU President, who manages the summits of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuy will be replaced.
Catherine Ashton's Italian Secretary of State, Federica Mogherini, will take over European diplomacy.
The Italian woman who will become Vice-President of the future European Commission has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.

How to Survive a Return From Holiday?
Take your time and get some sleep
The last days of vacations are ahead of us.
Getting used to coming back from a sunny beach or a cottage to a normal working pace can be a challenge for many.
He may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: not rushing and having a good night's sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "Fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but today her daughter said that she wasn't losing hope of an 88-year-old comedian getting better.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in today's statement.
Wish her luck.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after her emergency call, according to which she suffered a cardiac arrest at the Yorkwill endoscopy in the Upper East Side, as the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are confident of her condition, which remains "serious. "
The reactions did not keep them waiting long, including incredible online support from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
♪ Reality is twisted subtitles ♪
That the media are distorting reality with their headlines is not (unfortunately) news.
I know the headlines "sell" the papers, but unfortunately I also know that there are so many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been really worried about lately, it's more likely the word pisses them off.
This concerns, in particular, articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel attacked Gaza" are quite common.
It is only in the text that Israel's "attack " was a reaction to the launched missiles from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
That's when the headline "Both parties broke the truce" appears.
Does the journalistic community realize that by doing so, it is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived Shoa.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish swine" and such mistrust, it stopped me.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler didn't?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews were destined to destroy the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as "the watchdogs of democracy."
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to act if one of our neighbors decided to destroy the Czech nation and wipe the Czech Republic from the world map?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live on Israel's territory.
And they're fine.
If you ask them, why don't they go to "theirs," like Gaza, answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel they have work, social security and top health care (I have seen myself go to the top private hospital of Hadassa, which is funded from the sponsoring gifts of Jews from all over the world, usually also Arabs, and of course they are treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help from Gaza, and thus this troubled area, is to rid Hamas of it and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in headlines.
Inform Hamas's practices, its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas aims to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations.
Inform that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been flourishing through humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, but for which Gaza's administrators do not pay and even get upset that electricity supplies are sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in building underground tunnels to penetrate suicide bombers in Israel, but to build apartment buildings, hospitals, and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon Buies For $1.04 Billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed Information's claim from Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys $1.44 billion ($970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement was a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because you were expected to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google for one billion seemed certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, who had just founded Justin.tv three years ago, was on the verge of becoming a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online games on it - in the words of Business Insider "YouTube for Live Playing."
The Twitche interface.
On YouTube are already popular videos "Let's play," the kind where sage (mostly older) give the game processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is, YouTube doesn't get too excited when describing Twitch, it's a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
Mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have at our disposal is the statement by CEO Twitch Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster."
The next mystery - honestly - is the incredible success of Twitch.
It's hard for snobs like me to say that they rather do sports than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about playing games instead of real acting just watching.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder playing Resident Evil at 3:00 in the morning, and it's another thing to watch a stranger get 20 hits in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you might be watching right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control your own perspective is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that games like speed run, in which Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time finish the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone isn't a master of playing or humor, his channel on Twitch is probably not gonna be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to use that?
It's hard to imagine Twitch meddling in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as if it had been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something every company wants to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, "believes in the future of games," and the media do not seem reluctant, even as a - swallow - viewer.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another English translation of American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on "Holy Scriptures Are God's Word."
Added original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, they often put us before the question: " Whom will you believe?
The supposed word of God or the word of man?
It's as if human research is completely nothing compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God, " they refer to the myths of a god written by people.
If there really is intelligent with a Creator for any purpose, then it is he who has created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that match it, and it must be he who has supplied further evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulous.
And they were the people who wrote all those lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who have been "motivated" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or maybe listened to the dictation of angels, but those texts have not been written by anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, a über-galactic supergenius, an ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of such greatness had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, a single scripture.
It would be known everywhere, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to deal with such a work.
And people wouldn't have to trust her blindly because she would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would continue to inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, and they all constantly fall apart into increasingly separate denominations, seeking questionable truths and each in some way claiming divine guidance, regardless of the continuing expansion and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Baha'u'llah's Kitab-i-Akdas, Zarathushtra's Avesta, Sikh's Adi-Granth, Mahabharat's Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and the "discovered word of a single true god" and the believers involved each say that the others are astray.
The only logical explanation is that, to a certain extent, they are all astray.
None of the above-mentioned books has any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historical accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apology (defense), because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with the fact that each one may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and thus are the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudices bound by politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more like a mutual comment.
We must point out once again that we have two different authors whose work has somehow been mixed together during some editorial review.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. five books of "Moses " and do not attribute any of them to Moses, for he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
There is no way that the Bible is as old as its believers think it is.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by docéti and ebionites and their completely different views on Jesus, who eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, such as luciferians, were scattered and discredited by further Bible revisions.
One of these modifications refers to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to young Mosaic religions, the authors of the New Testament chose to ridicule Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mount, " changed to Beelzebub the "Lord of the Flies. "
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions on the Nikaji Assembly.
The four Gospels were accepted and 16 others were rejected simply by raising their hand, as if the reality of a matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was being read about Sundays in the Christian centers of those days.
What was read for the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about in the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
And that's how the canon core evolved from the mouth of the primary church.
So the council simply accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that passed between the uneducated masses at that time.
But so did they consciously remove more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to books that were approved.
Among the rejected items, we will find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God's Word refer to books that are only words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the true author of this random mixer of legends, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by men and certainly not by too much enlightenment, rather the contrary!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, no matter what it is from the beginning to the end.
We talk about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual magic, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure him from leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants, and bats are birds, and whales are fish and pi is an integer.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from a pen of a truly superior being and was intended as literal history, then it would contain absolutely nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, he is totally failing because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or supported animal cruelty, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, plundering, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But the creationists are still ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
Why?
Because if the creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work " as" worshipping creation instead of the Creator. "
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself and even insist that the disprovement of their supposedly "holy" books somehow disproves God as such.
Not their version of God but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God himself, because they think they're HIS word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposedly "invariable word" of any god has been invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, altered and often deliberately altered and twisted by merely erring people.

The assailant at Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of whom died.
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, entered the elementary school building in the morning and attacked around 11:30 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen then killed himself by jumping from a height, said New China with reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one child in accordance with government policy.

For the last two years under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has participated in the complete visual transformation of news relations Television Newspaper, Střepiny, Bang! and other publicist TV shows Nova.
David Fiala controls the synergy of communication between the editor, studio management and graphics department, which is the essence of art director's work news.
He has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the way we want to continue in the Nova news visual," says the creative director Novy Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud supposedly succumbed to hackers, they got naked celebrity pictures in public
Screenshot with a list of leaked files
So far, an anonymous user on server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, highlighted by the American server Mashable.com.
Supposedly it was obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users uploaded them via automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the problem.
Part of the celebrities reject the images as faked, but several of the images have already been acknowledged.
Among these are actress Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in Die Hard 4.0.
The hacker's goal is to use the captured images and videos to enrich.
The footage reportedly showed interest in American magazines, according to news on server 4chan but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely a weakness in iCloud security.
There was a tool on GitHub server two days ago that enabled you to get passwords to user accounts through rough force, i.e. by automatic repetition of login attempts with different passwords.
This tool proved to be working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before publishing this tool.
iCloud users should therefore change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
Escape of naked celebrities images is a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, secured many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, upload sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it takes place only on wi-fi and after connection to the charger.
So you will be able to move sensitive images "to safety" in time, and especially you will have the space to delete the failed images, so they will not unnecessarily occupy space in the online repository.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
Smart way to save money for college scripts
Since the price for college scripts for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the upcoming student of the second year came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He invented a system of book lending from seniors offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
"I got a book for calculations that normally cost $180 for a semester for ten and chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College, Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different ways of managing these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is lending textbooks, which allows students to use the book for a semester often with a significant discount than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 bookstores on campus premises, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in response shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Stores in University Bookstores, less than half of the texts are purchased.
Here's 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy it at Chegg.com, a retail book specialist, for $ 239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind other people's comments or wear and tear, the learning texts used are an appropriate option.
Chegg.com sells "Calculus" for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid 42 cents for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The new one was sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students check with their teachers whether the older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important to work in seminars.
If so, older editions can be sold at a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a popular alternative for buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Borrowing
Borrowing textbooks is also worth considering, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and you do not need them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 for the entire semester.
Learn about the terms and conditions of the store in which you borrow the book, including the penalty for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get a regular book instead of an e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
Anyway, walk around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon gets on Pepperdine Law School, recommends following ISBN because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before ordering a book online, make sure it's really stocked, Gault advises.
He's convinced himself of it.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the university bookstore book.
Mud, mud.
And then they found torso rifles from the end of the war in the well.
The well is just outside St. George's church.
We unearthed the vegetation around and started pulling out an age-old load - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we hit the barrel," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it was a torso offensive German rifles used by SS units.
The discovery is supposedly unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were made until the end of the war.
And there were about 300 thousand of them," Novák added.
All the wooden constructions have broken down over time, which is why they are useless.
Her body, however, is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it get in the well?
There's an explanation.
Maybe it was thrown by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by SS units, probably out of fear of being moved.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were dropping guns in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the enthusiasts of the Rainbow Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were plenty of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, carefully pondering the mud to avoid any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," added Novák.
The discovery ends up in the museum's depositor at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
An exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of the pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take this... they call me from Donetsk," he apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz Ukrainian general colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also director of the local center of liberation of prisoners of war.
General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
During any such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That will be it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, former fighter pilot and active participant in anti-government protests on Maidan.
Yesterday - when we were talking - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of the pro-Russian separatists is spent 24 hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the Prorussian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number by 30.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed the captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not the Czechs yet.
But I do know who to turn to in Prague if we could run into your captured countryman and free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after questioning, as well as any other stranger.
Separatists consider these men to be rent-a-mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - including the Czechs - they put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
This guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also acts like a state in war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, it's in exchange.
Some sources say it's long over 100 men.
We've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we've only freed them... from the war, if they decide to keep fighting.
The rescuers are at war doctors, surgeons, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day there's more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one or another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes all it takes is a simple human request to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority from the Prorussian separatists and even trust... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "Crazy General With Steel Balls."
I'm not offended.
And maybe that also captures the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Staff of Officers, I have earned some authority before.
I never smart, cheat, and keep my word.
No matter what, I'm being honest and telling the truth.
Even if it's the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansky one, it's very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they torture and kill them.
And that they're crimes.
I've often risked my life, even been captured in the exchange of prisoners... this job could mean an end to me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know about?
The Ukrainians and separatists resort to the torture of prisoners during interrogations.
I'm afraid so.
And executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There are no indications that the Ukrainian army is committing anything like this.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't give the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the Prorussian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying to be independent and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The Separatists are fed up with oligarchs, and they are their irreconcilable opponents - to the death.
As we say, they ate up their throats.
The same dreams and desires that people showed up on Maidan, by the way.
And now I have a bit of a hint: Russia supports separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be great and the other to be small.
This sentence of mine already has an irreconcilable contradiction in it.
A.cz: What do you think of one of the toughest leaders of the Pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am without a gun and show soldiers or armed men loose arms.
And I'm always on both sides of the 200 or 300 meters in sight or in an optical sight.
The faces of the people who point a gun at me every time I see them... and they can pull the trigger at any time with their guns.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as a little gubernia in the great Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be some sort of misunderstanding.
In his opinion, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a discussion show of Ukrainian television, you called your Prime Minister Arsenius Jaceňuk a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
I'll always get at least five times my fear in those 300-foot walks.
Why, then, should I hide from the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Jaceňuk a "rabbit."
And a rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of Ukrainians that would lead to fear or have respect and authority for others.
His behavior is directly copying the rabbit's behavior.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he doesn't have the right to cry in parliament, beg him, play with him intrigue, threaten to put up a position... he has to run the country, manage it, and protect it during the war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on our weeping emotions.
He is the first of Ukraine's ministers.
And Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's always complaining about everything.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why Galaxy Guardians Couldn't Save Sales
Misplaceable 3 Sylvester Stallones returned less than $30 million from the $90 million US budget and Sin City: The woman for whom I would kill only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also films for children like How to Train Dragon 2 were disappointing for cinemas.
According to an article by Robbie Collin in Telegraph, children's films are to blame for their own quality.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films and how to train Dragon 2 simply called "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average assessment of summer movie premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results that take the view of viewers and film critics into account indicate that this year's film crop is of a similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators there may be a change in audience access and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney's processing of the Book of the Jungle, told Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing. "
We have to admit it and not try to chase what's been done.
Unlike the current Hollywood cash market crisis, Netflix's netflix profits have reached $1.2 billion through online services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized his studies for relying too much on the rights to comic books and foretold "crashing" Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there may be something about his catastrophic prophecy.
With the introduction of possible large casino blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoň and Jurassic World, other figures are more optimistic in the film industry.
The producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply "cyclical." For Hollywood Reporter said: "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest casino blockbusters in history and no one will worry about selling."
DPRK threatens Seoul again, launched another short-range missile
North Korea launched another short-range missile into the sea, announced Seoul.
The alleged missile test was carried out shortly after the United States and South Korea's joint military maneuvers, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies in the northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
According to DPA, a spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Defence stated that the missiles were launched from a location in the North West of the DPRK and reached a distance of approximately 200 kilometers.
So North Korea probably first launched a rocket from the province of Chagang, reporting South Korean media with an appeal to military circles.
There's a Scud-type underground launch pad in the province.
This is another series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea carried out an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend there were protests by NATO summit opponents in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to participate in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall at a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the situation during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by plane and transported to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16 - year - old girl and an 18 - year - old man hiked to Govettes Leap in Blackheath after Sunday noon.
When they didn't come home, concerned relatives called the police around 8:00 p.m.
A search party was sent, including the local police and rescue team, and a couple were found around 11:00 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl hurt her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The cops stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
They were transported to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition.
Olomouc brought only one point from Opava, winning on the foot of Vasek
It was the 23-year-old Forvard who could decide, but failed in the two greatest chances.
After the goal, mainly the shot called up close three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on goaltender Opava Josef Květň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it that chance.
I'm mad at myself," your boy put ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it under the lid, it kind of slipped away," he wondered.
The Sigma defense didn't allow Opava much, except for Mikul's 11th minute raid, which was covered by goalie Reichl.
Then the Hanács started pushing, but in the block defending the landlord, they didn't let go and shots from a distance caught by Flower.
Fifteen minutes we compared, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of a game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Vasek did not change his chance, and so it ended at 0-0," regretting Coach Hanáky Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava took the point because of absences in the lineup, where Petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík were also missing in Silesia, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike its earlier policies, it did not allow them to join.
Substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma worked more soccer, but we didn't let her do anything except for one standard," said Petr Baránek, Silezan's coach.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got four points with a draw, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of Josef Lébr's club, who, after defeat with Znojmo, made his million-dollar deposit in the cash register conditional on diametrically different performances in other games.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébr's warning, so it can't be said that the boys wouldn't want to fight," he noticed Kalvoda and added to the address of Vasek's sleeping shooter: "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall.
But after the first hit, I'm going to replace him to save his goals for the next matches," laughed Kalvoda.
Al Pacino's excited about Venice twice.
The film festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After a tremendous enthusiasm over the opening movie Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly became among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days suggested that interest in the 71st year of the festival in Venice fell a bit.
Whether it was because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because the critics recognized were followed by Birdman, but for viewers less attractive pictures as a documentary on genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, with the view of silence and other films with social themes from US 99 homes to Iranian Stories, empty seats remained in the cinemas.
Heroes of comic books
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace did not yet surround such crowds as in the past, and it was said that it was no longer a problem to get a last minute seat at the hotel.
There is more talk about the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder it has affected institutions as respected as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself as a lack of personality, but only in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs by representatives of Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield's comic book superheroes, who in 99 homes were quite successful in their dramatic roles, the main event for all generations became the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino.
Plus, he's got two movies here.
In the story of the Vision shown outside the competition, which was filmed by Oscar Barry Levison according to Philip Roth's novel, Pacino's forty-seven-year-old role is close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from end-of-life depression and personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as the strange owner of the hardware store from a rural town in the movie Manglehorn, which David Gordon Green made, was a really memorable experience.
Volpi's Best Performance Cup shouldn't miss it - but does Pacino's artist still need prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one especially, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims to be the country from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italians
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first picture of Birdman rewarded with a long standing applause.
The Calabrian branch of the Mafia is viewed by the view of family relations between clans fighting for power and money, and the director has been able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: quality script, camera, music and actors.
He also captured the chamber psychohriller Hungry Heart, which he filmed Saverio Costanza with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost killed her own child with her misguided anxiety.
On the contrary, French competition films did not receive a warm reception, neither the Ransom for fame, nor 3 hearts, both of which cling to the traditional model of consumer films that are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really delicious movies, Birdman and Black Soul, aren't so few in the first half of the festival.
And even though festival films have depressing themes, a new film by Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy featured in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American jolly 40s, was able to raise the mood for more than one day.
Cops caught four meth producers in Prague, drugs brought from Poland
"The detectives arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 in recent days, and 25-year-old women who produced and sold meth in Prague 9 from last November to this August," police spokesperson Jana Rösslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the strike force in Brickery Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug collector in Poland and a benefit seller.
The following day, the detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old male, based on the prior consent of the prosecutor.
The last of the four police officers landed in the premises of the Malešická incinerator on Wednesday morning 20 August," the spokesperson said.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drugs
The main organizer had a wide field of action.
In the workshop of the summer complex, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněvov Street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced meths, provided various equipment and chemicals necessary for its production and provided the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the drug further, divided it into plastic bags and subsequently sold meth.
He was assisted by a 25 - year - old, still unpunished woman, by transporting drugs from Poland or selling drug addicts.
For this she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rösslerová added.
According to the judge's orders, the CSIs also carried out several home searches to secure the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, tubes and other equipment and items that, according to experts, can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"The police found out from the available records that the main organizer had been convicted seven times since 1995 for property crimes, the woman was not convicted of justice," the police spokesperson added.
In 2006, the last arrest was conditionally convicted of the crime of sexual abuse and the 37-year-old auto mechanic who was prosecuted at large has been convicted nine times since 2009.
Even for him, it was mostly for property crimes.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other treatment of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they are facing a ten-year prison.
For three persons, the investigator finally gave the prosecutor an incentive to apply for detention, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as the other accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers in its other products very interesting things at a lot of "interesting" prices.
For example, a handmade chess board of 42 x 42 cm will serve as a good example in Italy.
If you like, prepare more than CZK 40,000.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.
Perhaps no one is surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a pawn of a standing horse at their disposal.
If chess does not seem to be a valuable gift, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course manually) in scale 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Breaking up high schools and high schools doesn't make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that gymnastics have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
It's mostly routine stuff, like transferring pots from summer storage back to classrooms and getting chalk.
They're gonna be a little more busy at the burning high school.
A few days before the start of the season, furniture, computers and other technical equipment are needed for library literature.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year high school in Hořice after three years opens and renews its activities.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by the registration of schools administered by the Ministry of Education.
"French Socialists should shut up and fix France," says Francois Holland's key ally.
Valls calls for a strongly fragmented left to "show its support" to a militant socialist president whose new division of office has not met with the agreement of most French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, collecting applause.
As a propitiatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French 30-hour working week, despite the passionate arguments made by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who suggested that the rules be relaxed at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday Hollande asked the socialists to remain "coherent" with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the Minister of Justice, drew a line across the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist MPs, where the Socialist Party criticized the fact that the French had lost faith in the future because of her.
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes among the socialists when she said she didn't expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and so is Prince Manuel Valls. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one couldn't even last until the end of summer.
"And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Penová told her supporters.
It reiterated its party's call to dissolve Parliament and stated that it was convinced that it would win the party's early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections and, in May, the extremely conservative right succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a poll from Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting up into several rival factions before Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, things could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
The streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections of another gambling hall and the city will not restrict street art.
Dog walking will not be restricted either.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the respective decrees by October elections.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which ends in a few weeks' term," said Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7 have decided to cancel the gamble on their territory.
But the games won't go away, the gambling bill won't change yet.
It's the task of new city leadership after the election.
Now we would not even technically make it, given, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must be approved by the amendment of the decree, will take place on 11 September.
On the day of the municipal elections, Prague 1 and Prague 8 are preparing a reference on the total ban on gambling.
There is currently a ban on gambling in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
He complains especially about Prague 1, which has already sent the City Council a proposal for places that he would like to extend to the current list of prohibited sites.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
The decree regulating walking dogs the city is preparing for several months, it is not yet completed.
The location of the halls and the issue of busking is solved by city decrees.
It can only be issued or modified by the council of the capital.
Town halls have only an advisory vote, they cannot issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory at hand for the Scottish independence opponents.
The Scottish Independence Campaign was in danger of making that mistake for the third time, when it almost placed on billboards all over Scotland asking whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you can't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet or earning their respect if you threaten them.
The New Testament morale is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots tend to drive money changers out of the temple far more than to let them dictate how to vote.
Since the head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, he repeatedly questioned his opponent, Unionist Darling, in a television discussion whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
It forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London's financiers, and with a Grimas, he fell into this trap.
Of course Darling won't support the Scottish electorate's mandate.
However, the debate on Scotland's currency has already been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defense of the state health services that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London's bankers on the currency issue and also gave the impression that he would not object to the privatisation of health care.
The way Salmond said it, "he got into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the "bosses" association, the Confederation of British Industry.
It's becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for a unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent landlord.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Prime Minister of Scotland.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's causing him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots don't jump up and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic school start according to Miloš Urban

Milos Urban Longest Year
The end was the best of vacations, the last week that hadn't gone anywhere, and we were just lying around and hanging out with the old lady summer, silence before the storm, peace from stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading Fast arrows, for the fifth time, whistling on a bike through the Imperial Mountains all the way back behind the Vary, somewhere to tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun stroked its back and shoulders, tapped the rays goodbye.
The evening of mild nervousness, still the holiday regime, to sleep at half past ten, in a week it will be worse, the moment before falling asleep they will stretch out from a few minutes to two hours, then wake up in the morning at six thirty.
He's coming Monday.
Mostly it doesn't rain, on the contrary, summer grins viciously in front of school.
Sneaking up in the ghostly light on a patty and feeling like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there's this school, ZDŠA A.
Potoksky with monstrously pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new, boys taller, girls busier.
There are bad guys out there, avoiding them, it's still interesting how infallibly they stick together and how early they are.
And these mature-looking girls who came in jinxed, they're laughing hysterically now, maybe something's changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything's the same with me.
And the new freshmen, some nervous and others excited, why are they even coming here?
Because he has to, educational military duty.
Inside, then, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfectant, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately, still the same one who supposedly lends the pupil the key to the tin box, where you can leave textbooks and which are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the locker room stays in memory, it's not happening now, it's pretty ventilated, but it's gonna get worse in a week.
It's just the idea of a stomach cramping and the headaches are starting to start.
A head that's even harder to learn from mathematics, that evil play for the chosen, which I am not, and I will never be.
Once again, the threes and fours, God forbid the fives, hide from rehearsal, fit into the bench and best sublimate, be there and not be there, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream so far stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas into space, where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone and doesn't beat anyone's foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only day one, now as it was years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She is threatened with extraordinary punishment - News.cz
The first delivery took place in March 2012 in the cabin of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without help, she was born a little girl who, after cutting the cord, wrapped in a prepared blanket, hid under her jacket and carried it to the road loader, where she put it in bushes located a few dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school
I guess it came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I needed to go to the bathroom, where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the cord with the scissors I wore to school," the defendant described and said she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day, she returned to her place, put the child's body in her backpack and took it away, removed the body from her backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairwell in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," she claims in the lawsuit that it is not quite clear when the newborn was killed.
It could have been tens of minutes, but even a few hours after birth, suffocation while covering the blanket or inserting under a jacket, hypothermia or exsanguination from an unbound cord.
The similar scenario was repeated next spring.
A woman in the nearest unidentified time from February to April 12, when a child's corpse was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, gave birth in secret again.
This time in the bathroom of the penthouse in the family house.
Without verifying whether it was born alive, without cutting and tying up the cord around the neck, the child placed it in several plastic containers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond.
Eventually, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, but he was supposedly unaware of the pregnancy of the partner.
Even for this reason, he is not now in court, only being punished for the offence against the law of burial.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it seemed human at the time," the defendant was not hiding the indignation, who allegedly was subject to and feared the man in the relationship.
During her statement, the young woman spoke fairly balancedly.
Tears only drove her to her eyes when she spoke of her relationship with her parents, from whom she herself left after reaching full - time.
She didn't want to kill.
"They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't get my gear because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I still wanted to put him in a babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," she answered the judge's question.
But she refused to act with reason and intent to kill the newborn.
The second child, she claims, was also born dead.
She didn't stop drinking alcohol even during pregnancy.
However, I have limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also reduced smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed that she was having health problems, that she was flooded.
And so is my friend.
The main trial will continue at the Hradec court on Tuesday with the testimony of the forensic experts.
On Wednesday, a verdict could be passed.
A woman is threatened with a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison and, if necessary, with a special punishment.
The Norwegian Cruise is approaching the three-billion-dollar purchase of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world's third largest cruise operator in the world, has advanced the negotiation of the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The business by Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $ 6.8 billion, which competes with the greater competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and rich clients.
The agreement can already be published this week, revealed the source on Sunday, but pointed out that negotiations still need not end successfully.
Owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in the Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be appointed because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to the comments, spokesperson Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's income in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced sales of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that the 29 billion segment of cruises will benefit in the coming year from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India.
Companies compete to become a preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer with US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the sale of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it was merged with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested one billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise launched shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration of regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting held a share of 28%, Apollo 20% and a private investment company TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration documentation of the first public offer, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise comprise together 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Prodemocracy activists in Hong Kong are provoked by the Chinese authorities the day after the vote decision
Nearby stood a group of loyal people to Beijing who waved the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress approved only two out of three candidates to participate in the elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the naming commission, which is likely to consist of members of faithful Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on election tickets and get pro-democratic activists to renew their promise and cripple Hong Kong's financial centre with the protests of the "Occupy of the Centre" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, and China's leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June that outlines China's official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference to be held by Prime Minister Li is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong Office and Macau Feng Wei should also have spoken at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fight against separatists in the east of the country and immediately open negotiations on "state sovereignty" of isolated areas.
His spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of implying that the regions of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated so that the Russian-speaking region would be empowered to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian insurgents as equals corresponds to a clear strategy that follows from the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly announced Novoruska effective independence so that instead of the West can join Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to reclaim the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were dominated by separatists after Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently designated the territory occupied as "Novorus" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass has published Putin's words that say that "incarceration is an illusion" to anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns before the parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government troops attack the civilian population in areas controlled by separatists.
"In the interests of people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of the state sovereignty of the southeast Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kiev's leadership for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of Kremlin spokesperson to correct Putin's "incorrect interpretation" remarks highlighted Russia's leadership's approach to addressing the uprising of the separatists in the east, which is different from the open cast of Crimea, where most of the two-million-dollar population of origin belongs to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty anecting Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and public opinion polls that have taken place before the conflict have shown broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and thus essentially give the Kremlin effective control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the headquarters of the main Russian naval fleet, maritime business facilities and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also a centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inauguration speech of June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's last call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals was followed by further insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists strengthened the Russians took control of Novoazovsk so forcefully that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This has accelerated the enormous civilian and military efforts to harden Mariupol, a port with metallurgical jumpsuits of 500,000 inhabitants, between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at the meeting of the European Union's leaders in Brussels and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit has not taken any definitive action - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
On Saturday, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowa after two colonies of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military troops broke into the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
On Sunday, the first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilowa during the Russian invasion were replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, reported Lysenko on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are involved in a scandal with unveiled photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after Jennifer Lawrence's series of explicit photos got online in the biggest celebrity hacked-photo scandal.
Hacker claims to have 60 photos of Hunger Games Lawrence's naked star and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle, and Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the leak from iCloud, personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko were reportedly also made public.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to the magazine Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It's a shame personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
According to the newsletters, Grecko, who is now in New York City, reported that hacking is "shameless " and those who have become his target feel" humiliated. "
It's believed that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of him rolling around the pool topless.
Palmer, for example, performed in the film Love and Honor, where Liam Hemsworth was her counterpart.
Palmer, the star of the TV series Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter: "Printing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods. "
Legally, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Sigma footballers made up for themselves, even without winning.
Olomouc - Thunder and Lightning, which the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be the past.
Even in Opava, they only brought a point for a goalless draw.
They did make up for the club boss by putting on a fight.
Paycheck money could come to the club soon.
"I will keep one more game, as I talked about it last week, but I am much more optimistic," Lébr confirmed that despite the fact that Sigma did not win, players convinced him of improved performance.
The fighting and deployment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that it won't win.
If we had played this way since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not yet lost," Lébr thinks.
Sigma in Opava survived the initial domestic pressure, then leveled the game and was better by the second half.
After the victory, Kalvod's wards reached, but they couldn't get to the goal, so they couldn't win.
The result is not what we want it to be.
To our complete satisfaction, we lacked only one changed chance," said Lébr, who does not think that only his threat caused a change in the approach of footballers.
I'm sure there were more aspects.
Whether from my side, from coach or fans," said Lébr.
Sigma has to count on pressure.
Players didn't really want to comment after the Opava event last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of the way.
I tried not to admit it," the young goaltender Michal Reichl was shaking his head.
Completely without comment then left a question on Lébrov's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vašíček, who did not change the biggest opportunity of the Sigma in Saturday's match.
But after all, he talked a little bit about pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everyone wants to come at us.
Today we showed that if we fight and we all ride on our asses, it will work," he said.
They took the warning to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about not wanting to fight and scamming it," said Olomouc coach.
It was similar to today's first 15 minutes.
It took us a while to get even with the toughness and realize what the other league was all about.
That it is not only about football, but mainly about fighting," Kalvoda said.
All we have to do is hope that Sigma's next fights will work from the beginning.
"I would love to believe it," he said.
