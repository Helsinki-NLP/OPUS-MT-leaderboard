The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a negative at the end of the trade
After a sharp fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions in CEZ shares have reached almost half of the daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has followed up on its fall on Monday since the beginning of Tuesday's trade, when it dropped by almost six percent.
This time, the stock drop on Wall Street is behind the decline.
The market's response to the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is also manifest in our country.
Share crash in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday was experienced by stock exchanges in Asia, although indexes, but during the day part of the losses eventually deleted.
The Hang Seng stock exchange index in Hong Kong wrote off almost four percent during the trade, but later deleted part of the losses and reduced the drop to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sydney's stock market was losing more than five percent, but in the end, the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
According to Taiwan's index, the exchange dropped by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the rescue action in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said the head of Hong Kong monetary office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy itself, i.e. without dependence on China's central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should quickly return to negotiations and approve the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries are threatened to feel the effects.
Bloodbath of American stock
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected a financial system support plan for which up to $700 billion was to be spent (almost CZK 12 trillion).
So the legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
America's shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest fall in over 20 years.
Dow Jones' index dropped by almost seven percent and dropped to a similar extent last time in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but once it turned out that the proposal failed in the House, the index found itself in free fall.
Congress has retreated: The US government can pump $700 billion into banks
US Congress leaders and President George W. Bush's government have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in talks about approving a bailout plan in the form of financial aid for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately CZK 12 trillion).
But it is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday at the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, Reuters told the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to sources, there could be a vote on the plan probably first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then there will be "sobering" due to the complexity of mechanisms to help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differing views on how the package should look like to stabilise the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi said for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy non-saleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which withdraw financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement of a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are so keen to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress' decision could affect Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both US Congress chambers will vote on the law, nor whether last-minute negotiations can be stuck on a problem.
The legislators hope to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still admit a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system should be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, in a series of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations
The President may veto this decision, but Congress may overrule his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain funding for buying bad mortgage securities, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remained.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
America's President Bush is also satisfied with progress in negotiations.
His spokesperson, Tony Fratto, said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates "a mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Cutbacks on golden parachutes
President of the Senate's Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed to be responsible for the money program, protection of taxpayers from losses, closure of reliefs, timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the company participating in the programme and to set up a committee with supervision over the Fund.
That should be run by the Treasury.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides for assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new instalments for mortgages it buys in order to reduce monthly repayment costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to the chief economist Patrio Finance David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"This is because it is not known what mechanism and at what price problem assets will be bought out.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will divide their losses between themselves," Marek told news server iHNed.cz this week.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, Mark says it's not that important.
"Much more important is that this week's congressmen agree to support this plan and to sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is the most important at the moment," Mark emphasized.
Knife edge duel: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise on how to choose
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Yet there are enough reasons to get a single player.
The choice depends entirely on the use and demands of the future owner.
I don't think you'll be able to get home a top-notch gramophone to listen to Maxim Turbullenc's latest album.
For one thing, such musical products do not come out on LP plates and there is no objective reason to do so from a qualitative point of view.
However, if vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues distress in your shelves, you will probably dream of such a gramophone.
It is the same with music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and qualitative categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend CZK 8,000 on a player, just like Pink Floyd's fan, it may be difficult for him to bite the headphones for 20 crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The selection is wide.
Battery stamina also depends
Some top-notch music players can do much more than just play music, but what most phones couldn't possibly do.
No current machine is as universal as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone and texting, he can play music and video, record both, he has a better one, the worse one, and maybe he can navigate.
And considering smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can barbecue and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of the phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on your screen sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, you can count on cheap phones not to play for more than a few hours.
If you make any more calls here and there, get another charger to work to make sure - this also applies to more expensive machines.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem arises when recording music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but few card reader can handle the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
You do not need any special software for players except for exceptions (iPod).
Just fill the machine with USB music from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create their own music library according to the name of the interpreter, album name, genre or user evaluation.
Some devices only display tree directory structure similar to Windows Explorer and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, cell phones can do more
When selecting a particular device, be interested in battery endurance, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and of course also in the comfort of control.
If the music is mainly a set and you listen to it on a tram every day for a short time, you just need any phone that plays MP3.
Which is really capable of almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much of the music formats a cell phone or player can do.
The MP3 can handle all, and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and besides it, the vast majority of instruments can also handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
You just need to visit the operator (or other provider) sites via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already in itself be a strong argument for the acquisition of a musical phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is crappy and is mostly limited to quick-leaved radio hits.
Prices are also not lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will be dominated by the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you feel the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
Whether you always carry headphones with you or at least wire hands-free depends on whether you carry your headphones with you.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every phone, but only a minimum MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage of musical phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones are normally under 3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already buy a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to normal headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped phones with 3.5 mm socket for normal headphones are up to 15,000.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
Minimal function, the similarity of the control with the previously common tape recorder or, for example, the gramophone is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an accidentally switched on mobile internet and then a giant data transfer account.
What kind of device do you reach for?
Even cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even with the purchase of the appropriate card you can fit into 2,000 crowns.
Be careful, though.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can handle 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you should reach for specialized phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the operator's comfort is close to a separate MP3 player.
It is further in Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman mobile phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The same service and in the same price category up to CZK 4,000, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (commonly 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take MP3 players away from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet there's something missing here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones cheaper.
Maybe he won't miss long.
We have written on Mobil.cz many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
After all, the ČTÚ confirmed this, which pointed out that the SMS price is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrations high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to beg to say that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, who has said in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic, is often accentuated by the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ).
It is probably true that the classic operator with his own network probably doesn't have much chance anymore (after all, it would probably be hard to find frequencies already).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant price reduction, to which classic operators also had to respond.
Even before the entrance of the pike such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices like ours sounded on the market in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not need to go too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual mobile operator in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The financial group Penta is behind Mobilking, which owns, among other things, U:fona in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobileking in Poland shows, a bet on an unbiased target group can be quite a good move.
This operator specifically focuses on men.
"Right Men Choose Mobile Entertainment Company - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could catch on with us.
Vodafone's spokesperson Miroslav Čepicický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of service offer.'
In the Czech Republic, no chance, they say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobileking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
More likely the Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview for Mobile.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
The interest of launching a virtual mobile operator has long been unknown by the GTS Novera Group, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 Telefonist in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them in the negotiations," says the press spokesperson Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's a brighter time.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this time we do not think that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any subject with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň of the Press Department of Telefonika O2 said in his comments to Mobile.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobila, adds in a rare agreement with O2: "We have not yet noticed any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further."
He adds: "By the end of the year, a virtual operator can hardly appear in the T-Mobile network.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table to consider in this short term."
Vodafone tends to draw attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepicický says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in terms of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider most beneficial from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a fall in prices and thus to a decline in their profits.
Why, then, make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
The fact that operators can pull together when they are involved in something is also evidence of the pull around the origin of the U:fon.
Probably the greatest pressure towards the ČTÚ went at the time of the creation of U:fon from the company T-Mobile.
This is demonstrated by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
Now it is U:fon suitable as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented on this: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
However, given this approach of mobile operators, it is directly striking that Czech regulatory authorities are not interested.
This is not just about the position of the Czech Television, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stand on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a contract was concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual operator to rent the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has yet been concluded, because the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations said in reply to our question.
It may not surprise the operators' representatives to make such a statement.
It is more than considered from an office that is intended to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile telephone services. "
But apparently, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and price decline are not one of the interests of the UOHS.
In fact, the whole case is shocking when the three mobile operators are moved by their reactions.
The question, if it's really just a coincidence, is offered entirely by itself.
Just as the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations is certainly just a coincidence and a hard competition.
"The Office did not find any evidence of anticompetitive behaviour in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have a corresponding increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening a mobile market for virtual operators are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points at issue.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the Czech Television, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the network operator's approval is always needed to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - it has quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So it has to be dominant in a particular segment.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to the UOHS that three mobile operators are making a striking similar approach.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The responsibilities of the ČTÚ are then quite common in telecommunications, which the ÚOHS gives away from the whole matter.
We've met him in several cases like this.
Unfortunately, the extension of ČTÚ's powers to competition in telecommunications to the recently adopted amendment to the telecommunications law did not succeed, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's possible when no one's watching
The operation of some pseudovirtual operators, which exist in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own mobile phone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
These are usually multilevel marketing companies.
It offers its own mobile phone services such as Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer then gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators forbid a similar sale.
"If there were cases you are talking about, this could be a breach of the terms of the contract that we would be dealing with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activities will not be brought to the people responsible from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it could be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are resisting such a procedure.
They have considerable profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepicický points out the possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not listed in their name, so they cannot have it fully with them as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
That should be the least weird thing about the CTU.
In addition, another question for the UOHS is being opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes to similar processes, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the IOHS has quite strong powers to detect similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operator's explanation that they have no idea of such activities and their business conditions forbid it.
♪ When we won't be the most expensive ♪
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
In fact, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend them more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these moments that regulatory authorities intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and another one was packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case over like hot potatoes.
From our experience, we cannot shake the impression that confusion in competences is more than useful in these cases.
But let's not throw a gun in the bush.
If background information is correct and the virtual operator really shows up soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of Czech Statehood's Day presented new recordings of the national anthem where my home is.
The orchestra of the National Theatre, led by Jiří Bělohlávek, has newly recorded the Hymna.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, choir performance and instrumental wording.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took up the singing.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymens.
He has already told Czech Radio that he has deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices that are distinctive and popular to sing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that they had a clear diction in order to understand the text well so that they would be in harmony," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home was first heard in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovackáček Josef Kajetán Tyl supplemented by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her as their own.
The first verse of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem sounds like
Prague public transport on Wednesday for the first time can also ride to the chip
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers to enter the metro, tram and bus will take the first ticket instead of a paper ticket will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At this point, he can get about 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will apply from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their chip card uploaded to their info centres and workplaces of the Transport Undertaking in the Metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased from yesterday via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
Over 400 customers took advantage of the afternoon service.
Those who make use of the online store can definitely forget about the window in the subway stations, where they have so far had to stand regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
Coupon buys it online, and they record it on the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"A desk with a trained operator is available at these locations to help interested parties purchase online and also upload a purchased coupon on their card," said project spokesman Martin Přeběrý.
In addition to libraries it will be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines, which are installed in several subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyla, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," said Careful.
Coupon checks the driver's seat automaton
The vending machine service that starts working tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
Thus, on suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, mainly the inhabitants of the Central Bohemia municipalities travel to the capital.
"On trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the conductor is equipped with card readers to determine the time and bandwidth validity of coupons," said Filip Drápal from Ropid, which compiles timetables for Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built in the ticket office by the driver.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the chip card on arrival, but additionally to attach the Opencard to the designated location on the side of the cash register.
This way the driver checks the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not ride suburban buses and won't remember when their coupon expires can go again to self-service vending machines where coupons are recorded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetens wanted a referendum from the U.S.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested the integration of Šumava with the United States.
It flows from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, reportedly in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This results, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov ask in a letter from the US President not to allow the return of "Sumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, signed "People who have the fate of Sumava at heart."
Since joining Czechoslovakia is supposedly giving the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter from the US President ask that he take over Šumava the Protectorate for both present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would admit this territory to a state that oppresses and disproves minorities and nothing, from nothing has contributed to the victory of the Allies," the letter says.
The reason the authors can't sign is supposed to be a fear of revenge by "Czech oppressors. "
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the views of the Sumava Germans, it was enough to hold a referendum in the Sumava County on whether its people wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, some of the contemporaries say that it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that it would be their removal from the Republic, few of them allowed themselves to do so.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, he was like a budejovic German deployed to the navy on the Baltic.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home they could use Czech," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted on him to be removed from the Republic on the basis of Beneš's decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
The Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, as well as on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving quickly and alcohol at the wheel.
And remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
He wants to reach into the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the whole campaign's "bloody" slogan says:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And then there's the word "pay" in a pool of blood.
It's supposed to symbolize the fact that one can pay with one's own life in a moment of inattentiveness.
The spots will "frighten" the audience until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of victims of accidents can be seen commonly.
He promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The euro RSCG agency prepared the stocks.
Sugar and whip for the driver
"The driver is subject to a system of sugar and whips.
For them, sugar is that, for example, when they go red, they save time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says hospital traffic psychologist Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in the press, and especially negative ads, the psychologist means.
According to him, less effective are boards that warn the driver of the danger.
"If a static warning board is installed, it is likely to merge with the environment soon and drivers will not pay attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Prejordánska, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the diary.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to advance a similar percentage (territory of Israel) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that the return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places " that lie within the Old Town.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he emphasized.
Leaving Golan Heights
Olmert has also spoken for Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving Golan," he pointed out.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to gain the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah (Shiite) movement; they will have to give up the lasting support provided by Hamas (Shiite movement) terrorism (terrorist networks) Al-Qaeda and jihad (holy wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question arose as to whether the stewards and passengers can travel by bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the operation of the steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in which a 22 - year - old stewardess died last week appears to have been caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the most safe place in the car, although she has two more seats.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role plays whether the bus according to the technical licence is equipped with standing places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Long-distance buses The Student Agency does not have standing places; this is confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This was dealt with by the Ministry, and it did not allow passengers to move at first.
They subsequently called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to use the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
He doesn't know the law of the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle conductor; its rights and obligations are not defined," adds Hanzelka, the spokesperson, less clearly.
On the contrary, the director of the Department of Traffic of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný considers that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed standing places in the homologation.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where standing places and limited maximum speed, interurban with standing places with higher allowed speed and remote without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Expert BESIP on traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín in the movement of stewards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"There is not much danger in a smooth ride, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
It's not even certain when the turbulence will come and the stewardess can hit her head."
"However, if the bus stops sharply, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of stewards must be addressed by the carrier's internal regulations," he says and also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unsolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 of them.
Even after an accident, the director doesn't consider their profession a risk.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the career of stewards is at risk, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by passengers on arrival.
It would save costs too," he says.
As an interest in safety, Alexei Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his cars.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been up against that from the start.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he said for Week.cz less than a year ago.
There's been an enormous tragedy.
A young stewardess from Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident of a link to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned off without using the rudder from the detachable lane and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he hit the right front.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These places can't be reserved for long-distance connections, they're blocked."
The company's going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ortel, but the financial compensation is also expected by the culprit.
Law maker?
♪ In the open ♪
The specification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could bring an amendment to the law on which the 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works over the year.
"However, she did not come to any specific conclusion.
The buses do not solve very much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone while driving," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the operation of stewards to be a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes with the responsibility of police and labour safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The Bank's employees are not absent from the letter from WestLB's board of directors.
By combining the Düsseldorf money institution's units with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, the "central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trade on capital markets" can be found in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
WestLB, according to the letter, will bring "a set of competences" ensuring long-term returns into this transaction.
And it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further alliances in the terrestrial banking sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a troubled period.
Unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the link between Deka-Bank, which the savings bank customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever the type, has been discussed for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas was told at the end of August that he did not see any meaning in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the Landesbanks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is responsible for one half of the Landesbank and the other half of the savings banks, entrusted the board with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be business on the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, the financiers are referring.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not spoken of for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that Deka-Bank could be merged with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and along with Helaba.
In the end, there was nothing out of this tribal council.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Land Government expressed itself against the participation of Helaba.
Not even the other two bank houses connected like that.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, speculation has repeatedly emerged about the link between Deka-Bank and the Landesbanks.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, has recently commented negatively on speculations about the connection of his financial house with others.
It seems, however, that, independently of this, it is believed that the convergence of the various public sector banking houses is a necessity.
After the election to the Land Assembly in Bavaria, the first thing could begin to be the link between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not very good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, it is gradually losing potential partners for such connections.
In the south, only a second violin would play even though the financial crisis has so far been much better than the banks' houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the association of savings banks and giro banks Hessen-Thüringen prohibited the merger with WestLB, which has a 5% share in Helaba.
This would be considered at most by Nord LB.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are, however, only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much they match the business models of individual institutions.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question of what business model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German Savings Union and the Giro Banks has not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, nobody wants in this institution.
That is why, in a letter from the Board of Directors there, it is also said that it is seeking "a comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual folders to Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend with the Italians"
This is Elena's first time, for Luca's third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena's gonna be there as his girlfriend, so she says everything's gonna be different, she says.
Behind them, at Kaiser's five-litre barrel, a stronger bearder stands and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest demonstrate how deep the tones can release his throat.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova railway station, this evening at 23.45 four buses with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" will depart, expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are occupied mainly by Italians; only Brazilians ride on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans were already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And out loud, Marco Guarda says, it's not Italian.
Marc, who's wearing a long coat with a fake fur lining and glasses with wide silver frames, belongs to the three buses.
He's been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, only this year he's organized three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10:30 p.m. leaving back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast by Kaiser beer, cooked exactly under the Bavarian Law on the purity of beer, health insurance and German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
The buses go out into the night, after the car station towards "Brennero."
Beer isn't served, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers sleep.
They're doing well. They're gonna need their powers.
He stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where he takes another break on Highway 8 in front of Munich and many other buses with Italian license plates.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwies as planned at 6:30 in the morning, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
One, put on a yellow cap.
It says "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Two: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" calls Marco in the morning air.
"Go!" Go and fill the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward so that you do not interfere, and not all the yellow hats on the same bench, spread out in space!"
Butter costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Secrets, show them we're being polite.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Three: "Be back here tonight at exactly 10:30 p.m. tonight!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, the beer tent area.
On the way one member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks on trees, signs and even on the election poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
The weekend with the Italians is the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Accurate information about the number of visitors is not available; there are 50,000 people who are going on their way through the Alps and entering beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy.
The ranks of Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts national statistics, in which Italians before the British (about 60 hits) and Austrians (about 80s) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy first place.
The Hofbräu tent is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is a good thing that this politician used the word "relatively" and included in his claim the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis development.
'Cause that's what happened last weekend.
The Dax index of the monitored financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a loan from the consortium of German banks amounting to several billion to protect against turbulence in the markets.
The person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the loan aid in question would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only on the really exhausted amount.
They say the money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
According to the newspaper report, this state financier has refinanced himself extremely briefly for long-term projects for which he lent money, which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrunk by 95% to €2.37 million, and its equity ratio decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, income from increased value of claims and certain securities, as well as from the abolition of credit trade reserves, fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euro.
Thanks only to the higher revenues from compensation for subsequent clearing costs in restructuring the former Depfa Group and the interest compensation under the tax rules and for facilitating trade for the group companies, the 16-percent decline on the revenue side was still moderate.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former state financier burned itself on mortgages for businessmen, which were then separated from the service portfolio and then managed by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little money in classical state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something off, and these depreciations will have a "essential material effect" on the calculation of the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have been vaguely heard.
The fact is, there's no dividend.
It has already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financialist of state and infrastructure projects since Depf was taken over.
More strongly than any other institute depends on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up, because banks guard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for a part of Depfa's loan portfolio - about €50 billion - short-term refinancing funds.
According to the Communication Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial need is covered by this loan for a foreseeable period of time and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently to a large extent of incompetent functions'.
Other sources were told that this money provided refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group in the market is now ensured.
This is what the shareholders and creditors of the bank hope to do.
But, given the dynamics and imperviousness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely impossible that the loan does not need to be fully exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded either.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency on Sunday late in the afternoon, the rescue could not calm the passions.
The stock exchange rate fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bonding classes were well held.
While preferential debts have virtually not moved, secondary bond courses are losing more significantly.
This applies mainly to the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically overdue bonds after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking Depf, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as emission banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to expect payment of securities within their due date.
But what almost no one dares to hope for can also happen - a financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, only legitimate hope has now become out of probability bordering with certainty.
This, especially for long-term creditors, is likely to prepare a number of awake nights to decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors can use the marginal line at least to generate a transfer of losses from previous financial years to exchange rate returns later years for the purpose of future payment of the capital return tax.
Sylvana and the secret box bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is supposed to introduce herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, girls start giggling: the German woman is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows that word from mangos, and she's talking about Japan on her new exchange blog.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was scared from my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, luckily I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and 20 minutes before nine starts a brief session with a teacher called 'home room'.
But before class started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students in front of class.
Since I wasn't in my school uniform, I wore my host mom's old skirt, my blouse, my blue socks, and my black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sajonara Woš Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is next week.
At that point, I was so glad that I started learning my language two years ago.
All 31 girls in class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kawaii."
I already knew that from my mango.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my seat.
The girl next to me smiled wide enough, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong came out, they literally filled me in.
They spoke through each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and impossible - and it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all unpacked their benth.
My host mom also made me a lunch box - and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, pickles and algae salad, fruit and some kind of fish in tofu batter.
I don't usually know exactly what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe!
Bent in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a guy a self-made bento, which is particularly artistically modified in this case, and hopes he gets to know a guy when he's having lunch at break.
I read about that in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause I'm just fascinated.'
After all, I've liked to read mango for years.
And in order to understand these comic books and their culture, I started learning a little Japanese once.
So it was clear to me that I would have to come here someday.
Because I also have a thing for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends; on the other, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach flees danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
But how could it be verified whether they feel the same way when they act like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has published contributions from well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, when we can't even prove that other people are conscious.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start focusing on another species and open the questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter inconvenient terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, he will do the same thing as many other animals: pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experiences.
That's not what I believe.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal life.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include side prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, among them knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could conceal the language essence of a person: because so much of his perception is associated with a language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out the animals.
But even if consciousness didn't matter, it would certainly be influenced by the language, so that the animal consciousness, however designed, would probably differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to see what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is impossible to measure either, because of the special hardware, to analyse it based on our own experience, we are faced with great problems.
Most of my leaders relate to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
It would be possible to examine animal consciousness processes regardless of their content, and that is exactly what is happening in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in visualisation examples.
But this approach, taken by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on neural correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but maybe they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the nefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I derive them from the fact that an emotional system, such as a fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we refer to as "fear " is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defensive system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially by humans.
In connection with language nature, there is a gentle moderation of perception, because by means of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states to attribute them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain stem dedicated to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings perceived by several animal families.
In theory, I cannot contradict this, however, I find it inconclusive.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear in rats and humans probably feels the same way both organisms: But how can it be verified, does Pankseep say whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior can't prove the conformity of the experience.
True, neural comparisons move us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be proved in man: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special territories and on the tongue), I rather explore emotional behavior than the emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can look forward to progress at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Like rats, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't examine feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than throw myself against the wall repeatedly.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise a ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"It is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early implementation of the construction schedule or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are limping.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the chairman of the Ukrainian Union, Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the leadership of the Polish association PZN was withdrawn and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki.
They say there is "a serious risk that PZN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish press agency PAP.
"We assured UEFA President Michel Platini by letter that he would not take this step of preparation for the 2012 ME."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced descent only last season due to manipulation, eventually they had to move quickly the start of the league.
The Outraged Dennis Quaid returns the strike
She wanted to advertise a new movie, she talked about private things - and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her ex-Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He's furious and he's punching back.
The late Rose War with the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having a bad fight - in public view.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time on the grounds of the failure of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful. "
She said she didn't know about the scale of the fraud until after the divorce.
Ryan's PR work for her new movie "The Women" was an incentive for this mental striptease - it tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: "He is crazy," said the 44 - year - old actor of the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and adjusts it".
Moreover, it is "political " that the 16 - year - old son, Jack, again "reminiscent of the pain and radical changes that are divorces for every child. "
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his thinking about cheating as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have an amazing family that is doing great."
Flight and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent according to one current study.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have again cheaper - this is the result of a study by the provider of American Express travel and financial services.
The company analysed its data on the bookings made in the first half of 2008 and, following the increase in prices in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 monitored European cities increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than in the previous year.
America's Express considers the dollar's weak exchange rate to be the cause of this trend, causing "the declining appetite of American tourists to travel."
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centres more strongly than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have even recorded a European record by 26.3 percent.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007 for fuel-intensive long-distance flights even increased by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, flight prices in Economy class fell by an average of 12,5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class classes changes were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, it grew by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter it fell by 23.6 percent.
In Germany's domestic years, according to the quoted study, prices fell even by half.
One reason for this price fall is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
The signal of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit-making lines by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the forehead of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is no longer able to assemble a working eleven.
He wrote Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the failed landing for the representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player didn't get into the game until late and failed with a pierced balloon on a stick.
His message was precisely formulated and sounded convincingly from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the break between halftimes was over, and most people were sitting in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades and enjoys greater respect than many moments.
So his request was also answered in a responsible place.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol approached and lifted his thumb as a sign of a match.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg, Martin Jol.
His order was probably similar: here with the second goal!
The execution didn't come up.
"Everything wasn't looking pretty here today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it more relaxed.
1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbasans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
Hamburger SV will celebrate this Monday 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lively updated table on the video wall in which their team was listed as a premiere.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
He suspects that the ongoing tabular result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalie Petrić and FC Bayern acquired by Jansen - is slowly located, but can't shine yet.
"We need more feeling and more dribling," said Jol.
After defeat in the vote
There's fear spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports on the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow gained weight again.
Around 20.30 this world's most important stock exchange barometer showed a 5% drop to 10 579 units.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the balance.
The worst part was at Dow at this time was American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' stock has lost almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, this company was owned by a major investor named Warren Buffett.
In the framework of the rescue plan, means are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at the same time, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive equity option certificates from financial companies that could be reimbursed in favourable exchange rate developments, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Action courses in Europe fall steeply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of doubt.
The stock exchange of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly descending and downloads the Dax index with it.
The American Dow Jones index loses despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank tore the German Share Index (Dax) deep into the balance.
Despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the shares of the aforementioned Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of its value, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important threshold of 6000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent scored 5 839 points.
Stock markets have gone to their knees all over the world.
In New York City, Wall Street's business day began with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion US government rescue package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points during the first hour of trading, or 3.3 percent, and he's at 10 809,25 points.
The American House of Representatives has a vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate could comment on October 1.
Other European stock exchanges were moving in one direction: in London the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index dropped by 1.26 percent to 11 743,61 units after the initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18 286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506,43 points or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595,75.
At MDAx, they lost the Arcandor stock after the announcement.
Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourist group announced that Thomas Cook would not sell shares in the company.
Dark Matter Affects Space Probe Flights
For years, scientists haven't been able to deal with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
With fuel lines that will soon freeze, she is now at risk of death by cold.
For years, one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - the anomalies of gravity slingshot.
Gravity slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
This allows probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses Sun Probe.
But what scientists have said for years in this case in amazement: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect according to the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, irregularities occur at speed.
Probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was christened with an anomaly of gravity slingshot.
Several experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attractiveness of matter by distorting space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was right, and he is trying to explain the anomaly of gravity slingshot through the so-called dark matter whose presence in the universe has been discovered by astronomers.
"The dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space explorers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It's obviously based on a gravitational force whose effect on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she herself is completely invisible, which means that she does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, even visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Foreign Minister's communication in Egypt, hijacked tourists are again at large.
Sudan kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
They say six kidnappers were killed in a firefight before they were released.
Five Germans were abducted in the south of Egypt.
Ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
Europe's tourists are apparently free to enter Sahara.
This was reported in a similar manner by Egyptian national television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to news from Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed his release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been liberated.
We are now verifying their health," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian national television report, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the gunfight remains unclear before the hostages were released: according to Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping even before the Sudan army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He said "it was all about the hostages taking over," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudan's troops shot six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be passed on to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The "El Masri El Jom" journal, referring to one of the German brokers, said that the release of the hostages is being delayed because the kidnappers are worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
Men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by stepfather " Leaded to Suicide "
Several years of stepfather abuse led a woman to kill herself to be heard in court.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, 27 - year - old Michael Treris of Stithins, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
Truro's Crown Court heard that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," he wrote to Treris in a confession.
It was also said in court that Ms. Randle killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said before the court that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time volunteering for the National Trust organization, persecuted the phantom abuse that was committed twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife stated in court that in 2006, Miss Randle's friends were saying that she was also very interested in surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she " gave up her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to suffocate with a plastic bag.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter's stepfather, writing a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more horrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, it probably wouldn't have gotten into court at all."
"I would particularly like to emphasise the consequences that Stephanie's parents said your crime had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Indeed, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
A clerk who has lost his data will be charged
The BBC learned that a government official who left top secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on the Waterloo train at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were in the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the said law, and there is no indication of criminal intent.
Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Office of the Government," he said.
A member of staff who may not be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police to accuse the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained classified analysis of Al Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and moved from home to an unknown location.
Cooperatives are facing B&B debt
British credit unions may have to deal with over £80 million in debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government provided £1.6 billion in Bradford & Bingley to protect deposits.
The interest of this loan will be paid off by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative accounts.
Director-General of the Association of Cooperative Bookmarks (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "absorbed" that the credit unions and their members must pay.
The 14-billion-dollar debt will eventually be repaid by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
In the meantime, however, the interest that will be generated will be paid every year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Fund's Compensatory Money Service Plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperative funds are accounted for in this issue.
It is humiliating that these institutions that have behaved prudently... must now repay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so far considered
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the bookmarks of this should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the bookmarks will have to find £81 million to pay interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperative business association, told the BBC that he was convinced that this was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the growth of the housing market must now repay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from so prudent."
According to the BSA, no bookmarks have fallen since they appeared in 1945.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter within the next few weeks to see what are the options to protect the credit unions and their members from an account that might be relevant," Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest will be paid for the whole year and it could be almost twice as much.
Given that cooperative reserves are shareholders-free joint ventures, this account will ultimately be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk will cost five pence per litre
People in Jersey might have to pay more for milk.
Jersey dairy has announced that from Monday it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by fivep per litre.
It is the second price increase this year, after the two-penny increase in February, and it comes after the research carried out by the consultancy company.
Retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the auction at customer prices.
Prior to February, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey was last changed in 2002.
Bail for the Bangladeshi ex-premiere dismissed
The Bangladeshi court dismissed the request of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid for bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the accusation that she received over $50 million from a certain businessman ($729,700) when she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption brought against it.
Khalida Zija, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasína is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), asked that the local army held by the government first give her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was released at her word of honor to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasin's request for bail with the fact that he does not need bail when he is already undergoing an examination abroad for a solemn declaration," said Rafique-ul Huq.
"Against the Order of the Supreme Court, we will appeal."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December election.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasína should return home after October 17th.
She was detained last year after the army held by the provisional government assumed power, but was released from prison in June to be allowed abroad for medical intervention.
Sheikh Hasin and Khalida Zijah both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in recent polio vaccinations due to Taliban-related violence.
The UN did vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, he says that for security reasons she could not reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spokesperson stated that this was the case despite Taliban promises that he would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccines from working.
BSkyB lost the ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost the litigation to review the Commission's competition decision ordering the company to reduce its stake in the competing broadcasting company ITV.
BSkyB's competition appeal tribunal ordered it to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9% below 7,5%.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB's share was thwarting competition and disproportionately affected ITV companies.
BSkyB bought the share in 2006 in a trade that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had given rise to doubts about ITV's independence and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of the Virgin Sir Richard Branson consortium, consumer organisations and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its share in ITV was unreasonable and a disproportionary solution - especially because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to waive her voting rights.
New investigation into the US attorneys' affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the report on the affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
In his report, General Inspector Glenn Fine stated: "Serious accusations, including potential criminal acts, have not been fully investigated or explained. "
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Justice Department relieved nine U.S. attorneys of their duties in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry stated that the lawyers were released due to weak performances.
However, it later turned out that the dismissals of lawyers were no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that dismissals were motivated politically.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate the accusations of misleading voters against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute government lawsuits.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The former head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, went under fire for dismissal and finally resigned.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector-General's report was very critical of the role of Gonzales in the affair, saying that he had "main responsibility" for layoffs, that he "abdicated" from his leading position and that he was not "remarkably involved" in the action.
Other officials, including former senior Bush advisor Karel Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
The rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
A singer who comes to the London ceremony next weekend for his special gold prize said he was "honored" by recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
The nomination for this year is led by the Coldplay group, which got into the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them. "
A song written by Jim Steinman needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and got to the top of the fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell was held in the ranking for about nine years and sold around the world for more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, in 2003 he was also operated on because of irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscene streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many veterans and longtime locals have difficulty finding the Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alleyway is in the East Village district, leading north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic move.
There are no street signs.
It's practically invisible in a regular atlas.
Still, my alley has an admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to redecorate the Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by a short alley simply because it was one of the last remains from before the block was finished.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which has the street in its power, does not have the slightest interest in sticking to it.
At the meeting of the municipal community property committee, representatives of the city office and Avalon Bay company drew up a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee prefers a variant where the streets remain in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan which should be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very few properties, and we would like to keep Extra Place in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that he wanted to pave the small street and settle seats, some of which would be used by a cafe whose interest in renting space is expected by the developer.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this deserted alleyway and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Housing Authority, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that the task of his office is to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighbor, Bowery, the Extra Place has left a shallow trail in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's big farm was divided between several of his children and that narrow strip of land nobody made a claim.
The back door of CBGB, a punk rock memorial that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley may be the most famous as the background of a photograph on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was amazing," says Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took a picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about East Village's refinement, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, albeit modest, should remain public.
Others regard Extra Place as a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog by the name of Jeremiah's disappearing New York (under the subtitle "The Book of Lamentations: a bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the section Let's talk about the city that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even during the day, bordered by rusty iron doors of warehouses and banged windows, where a week - old newspaper runs through the gutter. "
Except for a few exceptions, the alley looked exactly the same on a recent night.
The rat crossed the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where today stands a store with expensive clothes.
There was graffiti on the walls and there was an empty bottle of beer lying next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
A few passers-bys said he rarely thinks about Extra Place, but it suggested that he could use some encouragement.
On the other hand, Fields said that he thinks that some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, wet and disgusting."
Debate on Bilingual Quality: Immersion in English
In this issue, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a californicist academic and education director at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Worse than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools".
Effectively addressing the Hispanic voters is tricky.
Barack Obama's educational agenda proves it.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white pupils," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are learning English.
The question of Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider, for example, the Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East.
The pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are learning English.
Despite this, 100 percent of fourth grade pupils in state math tests in 2008 reached the highest level.
Nearly equally amazing ninety-three percent of fourth grade pupils got to the highest level in state tests from English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method from what Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Furthermore, and Obama should note this, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are learning English is "complete immersion."
Immersion in English emphasizes almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me: "We had a huge success with one completely new student from Mexico - after 12 months you would walk into a classroom and not know which one it is. "
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a role model for what other schools with large shares of Latino and English learners should look like?
The results achieved by the school should be taken for granted from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education makes it clearer to predict Obama's response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "English only" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish, " he said.
If Obama really wishes to delete performance differences, he should think carefully about educational patterns that work rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices plummeted on Monday due to the concern that even the US plan to save the financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
The prices of fixed-term oil trades fell by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell earlier this month to almost $90 per barrel, and then jumped on the wave of enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety recaptured investors on Monday, even after the Congressional Bureau announced that it had reached an agreement on the greatest rescue plan in history on the weekend.
This report has been overshadowed by recent fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of ongoing degradation, the government announced that the Citigroup Group would purchase the Wachovia Corporation banking division.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the furious weekend talks that led to the economic rescue plan "are proving unable to revive the mood in the market. "
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates, and exchange rates have become very uncertain," the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread to the world and especially China."
The analysts of this bank limited their expectations to next year, as oil consumption dropped due to slower growth in the economy, and reduced their fuel price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
A wild ride in the second quarter beats the team's record
After spending more time in the Jets jersey than anyone in the last eight seasons, Defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned the scoreless game into a splendid ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals settled with their troubled play with the gloomy clouds above them.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfect foreshadowing the afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation moved a mile forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter behind two more touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before half the game.
"It was nothing special," Favre told Coles about all his passes.
"He's a hell of a player.
We've been communicating greatly, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles were tossing, the defense attacked Quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis picked up a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into a fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced was probably the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal out of the field, giving him a 34-0 lead.
That's the most Jets ever got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe the madness, said: "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
Many points have fallen in a short period of time."
Rested Gebresassia has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2 mile long race under two hours and four minutes.
Victory on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 beat his previous time by 27 seconds 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassia, 35 years old, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - surpassed the world record or at least the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassia missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon because he was afraid - perhaps too frightened from the outset - that the polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on the start, 55 degrees on the finish - Gebreslassia won on Sunday with a flash-speed diameter of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As the line runners such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have focused on longer lines, the marathon record in the past decade has fallen by more than two minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassia told journalists that he had a cramp in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the break was more of a wake-up call than a delay.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselassia to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
A week ago, I started over, and I had a little doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - because he was supposedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon peaks, relying on conductors as if it were a race on the track, and building world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassia half in time 1:02:04.
After the conductors dropped out, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie last worked and escaped Kwambai, who then ran second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race finished excellent year with the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
Record time 2:15:25 is holding Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
The 36-year-old Mikitanova surprisingly won the London Marathon at 2:24:14 last spring.
Beijing games missed because of something described as back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon that ever ran, improved its personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big lead and then dragged them about 18 1⁄2 miles later.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
Proudness and obstacles to the life of black people in a separate city
Hidden among the scattered amusement parks of the Greater Orlando, several miles from everything shiny, noisy and giant, lies a quiet city in which the pride and intensity of African-American life revives.
Eatonville, the first completely black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet fields, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough guavas, two schools and no prisons. "
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Zora Festival! to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, even though she made it a tourist stop by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black people in Florida often resisted and shared their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing. "
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the locals remain cautious about the views of others.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says the 59 - year - old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where poverty rates are twice the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but it is also an oak shielded by the example of a southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that originated from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And worried about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons say.
She introduced her hometown to the world through hearty books full of dialects such as "Mules and Men (Mules and Men) " (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (Their eyes have watched God) " (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's tourist guide changed the city piece into road 17, which leads through the often passed center of Florida, in the stage of black history and human drama.
With the impact of a large drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers into the store of the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write. "
She also mentioned the new husband of Dash's widow, and she wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits in an hourly hotel. "
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This obviously wasn't a typical Fodor's publishing house.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90 - year - old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she said.
Hurston is still remembered here as a vibrant eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Florida's Jacksonville.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time when she came to town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is proud of dignified clothing today.
Most of the population were fascinated, said Franklin, but many grinned.
"The people of Zora always liked to see," said Franklin.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long. "
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, the contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no larger funeral ceremonies or large public readings.
"I don't think they understood her meaning for the world or her legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography, "Wrapped in Rainbows," published in 2003.
Change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch through the five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-way main road.
The spread of Orlando has already pushed interstate highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ' s, the struggle to stir races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things at people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had this lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration and stated that his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber was "a insulting rather than celebrating to my race. "
The residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"The Negro children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter, and CEO of the nonprofit group "Preserve the Eatonville Community."
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You are not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there is a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped create room for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with reckless self-esteem and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's biography of Hurston, who re-built it in the American canon, came to the shelves in bookstores.
The project with the freeway arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter re-founded the ramp lights.
Hurston's former neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five currents of the highway have resurrected, you would say that it has blown up the real civil pride," Nathaniri said.
Boyd said it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to attend the church here in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 on a re-tanned and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the centre of Orlando can sometimes act as a backwater alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today it's 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to find the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
It is necessary to have permission for most interviews in advance and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church painted by white people and depicted by black people in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival got bigger, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18 - year - old Edwin Harvey, a heartfelt love for the village sounds when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or a police force that he says would use some help.
And even younger, like the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, think, 'Oh, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently after church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look into history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we all speak fluent financial
Nothing's changed here at first sight.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that every day in the glass bee hive of offices above their heads, bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rattled by metal trolleys on the sidewalks and carrying muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics keep moving between towers and wearing, like human mules, 50 ironed shirts hanging from the scales on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street dining booths, and it's still impossible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until, with all the talk about pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this assignment to cover with a late afternoon siesta at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were already about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of cash windows to collect or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a trip to the Macy's mixed goods store and new customers base accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already selected their savings from smaller banks in places where they arrived, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They have collected money from so-called thrifts (a little like construction savings banks), money associations and savings banks, whose branches operate only in one state, and which claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks failed quietly.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers came home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops who stood in front of me and feared another collapse moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe harbor and which makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
The ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent financial over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and her skinny executive worker Dick Fuld with such a familylike attitude as if she was gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed 50-year-old housekeeper of my apartment, changed the subject of our simple conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me: "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated after the Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Free Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang participates in the demonstration presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organization "Cities Against Islamization."
They carry signs similar to traffic signs showing mosques crossed out by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties have achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were sometimes badly damaged between Friday night and this morning, and the police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as David's star, but detectives believe it might have been an attempt to mask extremist motives led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic community here said that they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming at the end of Ramadan's Muslim fast month.
In the meantime, Austria enters the round of searching for its own soul after the traffic swayed in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both extremely right-wing parties, who received more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, who has won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against scarves and burgers in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to meals where the relationship with Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides try to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't go on a cross-border trip.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star convicted of sexual abuse of children, forbade the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
Kent P.D. was sanctioned last Thursday after she handed over evidence of Glitter's past judgments on child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, by his own name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Lowest Criminal Court hearing in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the judicial service said: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent police asked for orders to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend personally."
64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, as it stores him a record of sexual assailants.
He must report to the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also pass the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
Kent police spokesperson said: "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to track someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for Kent police, and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual assailants in order to reduce any danger to the public to a minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to get on a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London while Scotland Yard successfully requested an order that he ordered him to register as a sexual assailant.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
The Home Secretary said that Jacqui Smith, Secretary of the Interior, is calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture true character, I take pictures of a master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, taken away from the focus on interpretation - will I achieve a relaxed expression of a man or woman.
An artist on one side.
On the other - man.
Undivided, aside from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a glimpse or a passionate hand gesture that is carefree, because they are not going to appear on the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" theatrical performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less famous face of masters.
With this aim, the photographer creates a unique iconography of flamenco from various environments.
The exhibition that takes place within the month of the flamenco photo program (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "a reflection of the ever-increasing international meaning of flamenco," says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any kind of people, but when you look at the photos, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people portraited "on the street" are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
Enchanted by the festival "Cante de las Minas" Bauer began a long way in 1997 to portrait flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that resemble classical photography thanks to the choice of camera and material.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the film and lends it to the contemporary spirit, an idea that Bauer himself reflects also flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which does not cease to surprise and evolve. "
What brings down the audience is not the action of the dance itself, singing or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is the constant work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of almost 70 photographed artists is made by famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology and will soon receive a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
The passion for portraiting led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea on "Portraits of a sports veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people," the photographer admits that "photoing people, getting to know them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think in the photograph, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
One encounters or encounters people, personalities he sometimes doesn't even know, or gives him only a few minutes to shoot.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "bold"
It takes place in an environment it doesn't yet know and tells about events unknown to it, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for twenty years and traveled in the Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature was admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing it "is presumptuous" and that "all indications that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it one day," finished his contribution to the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which he saw in the city of the aqueduct in four days around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the festival of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a dedicated audience, whose hour of time passed as water - a Peruvian with amazing precision and a lot of humor, remembered how the original "unbelievable adventure" of "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and of "the power to live more than what I had lived" was a literary mission; how it succeeded in "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly," carefully writing lyrics, correcting and rewriting; or how it influenced his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "memoir images" are the basis of his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is merely a fun, fleeting experience" - he emphasized Vargas Llosa with the fact that in his view "people are working on people" and "he is forcing them to try to get out of line" and called on writers not to "obey frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of the climateology, they lose the festival in Pozoblanc - missing the spear
The performance with the spears closing the festival in Pozoblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers confirmed that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermos de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Infavourable weather conditions have haunted this festivities for a long time, two out of three celebrations could no longer be held.
On Saturday, rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfights.
During them, the formations José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to stand up to bulls in the arena of Castilblanc.
It was only like this on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically good performance was given on his shoulders.
On the same day in the afternoon Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spears for greetings and one ear, which brought him more exposed seats in the arena than the art of Torredor.
Even worse, El Julii was walking through the bull arena of Los Llanos unblown.
In the second round of hard work without a breath, most of the audience received harsh criticism.
They ran a check in Álava in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hash
Ten to five.
Road inspection of Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (Alava).
Members stop two people driving in a van and they miss them.
The cargo, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to a report from the Basque Interior Department, members pursued and apprehended one of the people driving the van, a man aged 38, who was identified as A.A.J.
Detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road inspection on N-1 in places where they cross the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed instructions, speeded up and fled.
The members of the car immediately began to chase, until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few kilometers away, at that time both passengers jumped out and fled into the forested vegetation.
The members of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of them and seized 2,278 kilos of hashish, which the suspects transported, as it came out during the search of the Iveco Daily brand.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing drugs.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "wrinkled" and did not agree with the information given in the delivery documents, so the arrester was also accused of forging state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for a second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
Detained A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department for processing appropriate formalities before further investigation was made later.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her doing unusual maneuvers trying to get out of a parking lot in Montecito, told the magazine People spokesperson for California Road Patrol.
The witness explained that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "took a hard step on the gas, moved forward and backwards on a noisy roar, trying to get out of the parking space - she ran over her sunglasses several times while backing up"
A witness who apparently didn't recognize the actress at first saw Locklear moments after stopping on the nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was afraid for Locklear's life. "
When the police patrol arrived at the scene, they found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented" and therefore she was taken to a specialised drug and alcoholic center to undergo the test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was subsequently ruled out, "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was evident to the officers at first sight. "
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 19.00 even though she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU Association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
General Chief of IU and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being charged with negotiations for the benefit of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am too much of a federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares indicated the meeting to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the Sevilla City Council.
However, the head of IU insisted that, in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" was absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought to ensure that such matters were as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions'.
"May blood" ('Sangre de mayo') is Garcia's epic bet.
José Luis Garci in the film "May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by the Episode of the National Past by Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around EUR 15 million.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw the eloquence of the figures and the analysis of society" which he always admired in the work of a famous novelist, today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, explained during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of performers.
May blood with a scourge over two and a half hours will be put into the cinemas this Friday and in the future is going to be a more than four-hour TV series Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garci claims that by making this film he fulfilled the "child's dream" for which he owes Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to shoot a film for the 200th anniversary of Madrid May 2nd, he accepted the offer that the plot would be based on the Episode of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has fully contributed, means "a unique opportunity" for Garcia to create an environment with scenery and costumes corresponding to the image of "shattering Spain, which was wrong in the leader for which he was going to fight - the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country during the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support given to the movies The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goy's ghosts - almost twice May's blood - so he could not make some scenes from a script signed by Horace Valcárcel, with which he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empire) works as he is normally used to - on the stage with actors with whom he usually tries before shooting and who do not choose casting because it seems "demeaning" to him and also believes that "part of the profession of director is, among other things, to go to theatres and cinemas and thus to learn what happens in the craft he deals with."
Many of the actors he has chosen for May's blood have appeared in front of his camera for several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four nominations for Oscar, one of whom he has won, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May blood itself, the Seven tables of French billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is yet to appear."
Garcia doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
"In the beginning, you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize that you're only working for profit, so you're willing to make another extra movie," Garcia explains with more than a 30-year-old directorial career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville's Tortola Valencia dancer
The Seville flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the father of Catalonia (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, she and her family moved to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneered a woman's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she fought to cancel a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe was enchanted by Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "dance of the butterfly" evoke a guajiru or a "dance of the snake" some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also corresponds," she says.
The performance includes two exceptional personalities: Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel in one performance as well as in "Open Door" (La puerta abierta), and with dance teacher Matilde Coralová, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted an offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me."
In the performance he also reckons with the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Pac Arriagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájar, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of the actor Juanfry Juárez, "who has the role of eternal guide of this kind to artists who are primadons with everything and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place at such faraway places as India, the United States, and Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but no one knows her today and even less appreciates her work," says Bayónová.
The show starts today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "Newly Married Diary " also closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government at the celebration of the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
"The Triennial of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress that will be held in New York, a repair of the Nobel Museum House and a travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jimenez: That ray of sun" which was opened in May this year, and after going around various Andalusian provinces, according to the plans at the time of the congress should be moved to New York.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusian Government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Diary" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most holy Andalusian poets.
America doesn't like itself that much without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
Those are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No ill intent" and under the weight of knowing that Newman had left, revealing her unhappy vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be ill.
Even so, he was a man for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
The father of film and homeland died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when America's self-esteem is at the bottom, desperately seeking reasons for pride.
When times are rough and people without virtues and just a handful of those worth admiring - there's no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from a drug addiction foundation based on the honor of the firstborn son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of domestic food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that took a lot of effort to free itself from a suicidal food culture.
The stormy wave of admiration has flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, an Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that one man had not died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, an Oscar-director of Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the highlight of his career.
The evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high standard for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman lives nowadays - based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, that's the kind of people they are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he's been married 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, even though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
May he be accompanied by pride in the earth's harmony between his daughters and his admirers - not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was proudest of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self - sacrificing philanthropist. "
The Perfect Olympic Madrid Races
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we're gonna follow last night's race, I'm gonna say no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my opinion, he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense that right now, if it came to an evaluation and I was an examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
Nonsense begins with picking up a racer's number, which makes you have to leave early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give it everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding).
Oh, no.
Here you had to pick up a number (first nonsense, go there only because of that) and (after standing up the proper queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a size S T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that only small T-shirts have decided to buy because they are less clothed and cheaper?
Okay, these are little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very soon for the chip and the queue for it lasted over 15 minutes, the backpack had to be handed in.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't put our backpacks down yet, and when we've done that, it's been a lot worse to pick up.
Moreover, the waiting extended the rain by 40 minutes, leading to a general uprising and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some of us, like me, won't be showing the right time to evaluate the results for the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, didn't record the launch time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of that one.
So I think we're just gonna have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire premises of the company) and perceive what they hear in the interview.
With a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist " can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remembering what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
He can also sort the present by the conversational groups.
The receptionist records a third party in the demonstration video and understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to it and that it is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see someone, and she's telling her she's gonna be with her in a minute.
All without a blue death screen.
Fascinating.
But that is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found out that if computers had only the essentials, without the burden of commercial waste, they'd be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder when we consider that Microsoft version from version adds new features to Windows and more "extra."
Changing direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who tended to the theory that it was the first step of Google's competition with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system, not as absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more and more internet browsers.
The computer is turned on to trigger Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What are half of the applications accompanying the system used for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They need it desperately, and here I have a little example.
I took this photo in a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the late version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count on 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computerized.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one shining in the "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the "Godfather" of Francis Ford Coppoly, and in addition is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we're going to make a list of his life's roles, we can immerse ourselves in the image of a typical, pointy moustache who picks up weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's no more than a typical cotton men's undershirt, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above all others.
First of all, for its neck name - even if it is called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, singer's lover Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' excels over other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost indistinguishable) Belgian flag, which has models of the most emblematic tank top as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because a Belgian company doesn't specialize only in tank tops.
They also make hoodies college, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy shirts, children's outfits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
A tremendous resemblance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small figures, is a woman of life.
Now the Cruz sisters are taking their new action in fashion very seriously.
It means a lot more to Monica than just giving some pretty, famous girls their name.
In Paris, she participated in a graduation event organized by Mango at her new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the more insignificant fashion awards sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's warm and shy, and she'll get you up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that my sister and I proposed for Mango this autumn-winter season, and I also participated in the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine.
So it was a challenging day, but also an exciting day.
What's your new collection for Mango that you've been working for for the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the '50s and '60s, and we've taken a lot of suggestions from them.
I also love to wander around town and watch women walk around dressed, combine and grow their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I liked my clothes since I was a kid. I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house and go to my aunt's closet and look at her clothes.
That was pretty cool, almost better than going to the fair.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to watch my dresses.
You know, we dancers are based on how we're adjusted to feel good about our lessons and trials when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 the other day, were you hit by a crisis?
Nope.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, I'm in my 30s.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience and life enjoys with less mistakes.
Biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But there's one thing I know for sure, I'm gonna give my kid a sense of happiness, and I'm gonna raise him with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, you're about to have a few movie premieres you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to them coming to the movies.
I come from the theater world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course I can't.
I look forward to the premiere "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo."
Let's see how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the parade pier by Naomi Campbell's side, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a fundraiser for her "Women for a Better Life" organization, and the clothes that we've been showing - I've also selected two models from our Mango collection - have been auction off and the proceeds have been handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of things going on about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's engaged in.
She asked me to show off for charity purposes, but if she asks me to do a stand, I'll do one too.
For the benefit of third world women, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his vehicle to prevent him from starting his car in drunkenness or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known already in June of this year and is now included in the Annual Report of the Supreme Prosecutor, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return the driver to the wheel, which is why drivers will also have to take a course of traffic reeducation.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics between 30 and 75% of the car drivers charged more than once for drunk driving, he will be back behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this from happening as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded above the permitted alcohol concentration.
Its price exceeds EUR 1,000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study conducted in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that, for vehicles equipped with this equipment, in the course of the first year after the introduction, offences decreased by 65%.
In Spain, 115 people are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help introduce it, because the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary regulation of criminal provisions requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial cars and public service vehicles have already been installed in the testing room.
It is tomorrow that Congress of Members will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17.40 pm, as it stood in the program, landed in the presidential hangar at the airport of Benita Juáreze in México D. F. the plane of the Spanish air force, in which the prince and princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was just setting, but its rays had so far forced their eyes to cover their hands so that they could see a successor couple coming out of the plane.
Under the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver if he knew the Spanish prince and princess were coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, well, that's great, that's not gonna be able to get people to the airport at the time...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
But the Mexican press knows well who the Princess and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just by the red carpet and the military cordon, which makes up 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorary salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, very modestly dressed and with unfolded hair, does not have his usual "peeptoes," apparently reported to her that there is a storm in D.F.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at photographers and casually pose for them.
In the hotel door, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a chatty Mexican TV reporter awaits them.
Best subsidised fashion price
Perhaps there is no more suitable place in the world for a fashion award than Paris, and perhaps there is no more excellent designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is subsidized by the amount of EUR 300,000.
The Belgian woman Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, looked at her designs in the Manga window on Haussmann, Paris, number 54, and she almost cried with a touch.
Of course, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank designers Valentin for taking over the chairmanship of the competition jury, have caused us to finally have a luxurious dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
The Mango company's festively decorated chair table looked even more amazing next to the finest of Chagall's works.
Nati, who did not show anything with heartbreak due to her brother's recent death, wore the Elah brand and jewelry, over which he was hiding his breath, and hung into her son Luis - an almost two-metre-old elegant - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, as a true gentleman, he stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, for both offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - self-designed - pants and shirt, changed into long black sexy dresses for dinner, took a night stroll along the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the ballet rehearsal hall and, in memory of other times, grabbed one of the poles and indicated "grand plié."
Inés Sastre didn't stay for a tour of the building next door, but she showed us photos of her son on her cell phone before she left.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Parisian sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - counterstress number
Not 1000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about chaotic and furious everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 o'clock as punishment, but even worse, it's to imagine itself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings present life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat everyday exhaustion and problems to break free from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of the yoga position, classic massage and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, gathered a whole "menu" of options, adjusted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "guide " denies this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Sleeping Talking
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may startle you, but it's actually meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquie.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you were told that he spoke in his sleep last night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (e.g. once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There isn't only one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, ecuresis nocturna (night wetting) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fevers, stressful or heated situations.
In any case, it is a little researched phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
A child can speak in a calm voice, say single words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, weeping, long speeches...).
In cases where a child manifests himself with great power, it would be advisable to observe and consult an expert to see if he has a problem that causes him great anxiety and thus manifests himself.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do that by bearing in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the baby too much before she goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those with work to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somniloquie appears, try to remain calm.
Remind yourself that she is harmless to the child and that she will no longer remember what happened the next day.
Useful Advice
Don't wake him.
It's pointless because he's not conscious and you're gonna stop him from sleeping.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember that if you feel that he is very troubled several times in a row, it would be advisable to turn to counsel or to find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If it is understood what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious so he can get his thoughts together.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of, and therefore why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret information and what conclusions you draw.
Never tell a kid you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's just an episode that takes only a few minutes.
Illahaeusern... finally
Illahaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long, thin period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to transform one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were hard to enforce.
After the first attempt of the captain hosts Kauffmann, who shot from a distance just by a hair past the link, began to have Illahaeusern lightly on top and first Fonderflick from afar, then Hirne by air, Romain by long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
On the other hand, the opponent built a defense wall in the middle of the field and left only agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names of Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illahaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well situated for processing the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
But Illhaeusernu's goalman did not enjoy the joy for long, after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his teammates in a weakening.
Dannemarie, however, could not benefit from this and the eleven of Illahaeusern, which only slightly withdrew to "strengthen" the defense, has caused no more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball after the great confusion flew through very close to the lawn.
Sarkozy is going to meet angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour across Brittany.
In order to face the demonstration of the forces of fishermen who, on Monday, severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Norman ports, the French President decided to go to Guilvinec port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit, " hoping to" come up with concrete proposals. "
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen in order to take action against the sharp increase in oil prices, which reached a peak above 1,14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysian Palace spokesperson David Martinon, the president will "speak to them about solutions that can be imagined in trying to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and payment of sailors"
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with firmness.
On Tuesday morning, they performed a snail operation in Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing nearly 10km of traffic.
The holiday port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Sailors proved their determination on Monday, when the demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel of La Manche, as to Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
The fishermen from Turballa and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they eventually decided to act themselves until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is scheduled to decide on Tuesday how to continue the journey and its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Department of Fisheries who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not drop anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris" said, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Department.
Professional fishermen who do not pay oil tax are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they consider that the return threshold for the ship is only reached when the oil is below EUR 0,30 per litre.

Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on the delivery of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of a recession that hovers over the world economy.
The fourth aviation engineer in the world, Embraer, maintains its supply assumptions for 2008 with 215 equipment delivered, confirmed by his President Frederico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a great deal from the Chinese market, especially taking into account the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients within eight years.
AIG is supposed to be considering transferring 15% of its assets
American International Group's insurance company, who has been given over water by US monetary authorities, is thinking of advancing more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the $85 billion that was given to it as a down payment, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying the diary which quotes the sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to France Télécom, the AIG Board met on Sunday night to examine any referrals.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its airline leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance provider of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investment in private equity, adds France Télécom.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, France Télécom continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash in order to pay back the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of having the US authorities confiscate 80% of its capital, which will also dilute it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, an unprecedented loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777,68 points to 10 365,45 points.
The biggest point drop in its history (by 684,81 points) recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the renewal of trading after the 11th September terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the prevailing technological component lost, according to definitive data after the closing of trading, 199,61 points and settled to 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,8% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Depressed since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally succumbed after an unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the House of Representatives, a plan that was supposed to enable it to find a little stability again in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide Henry Paulson with the funds he had requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal from a sent market that sees Congress not being able to adopt a specific plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days would not be "too late."
"If this project is actually doomed (...), the relay will immediately be handed over to the Fed (the US Central Bank, notes red.) and to other central banks to put off the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of economist Global Insight.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States, "every new day brings down one financial institution. "
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of bank activities by Wachovia's rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets do not "only deal with the US crisis but with the global crisis" has been added by an analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market has gone up a lot.
The proceeds from the cashier's order to 10 years fell to 3.63% compared to 3.827% on Friday night, the return to 30 years to 4.161% compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, a second debate followed, whose task was to find out who of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The leadership tents of the Republicans and Democrats campaign were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a television duel followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however polite it was, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), considers that the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of the respondents, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday through the supposed good performance of his co-candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," he warned Bill Clinton on the weekend.
70, McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while stressing the "naïveness" of his opponent on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." there were repeated charges.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In this offensive spirit, Republican TV spots have been happening since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," he replied on the weekend of the democratic spot, which blames the Republican for not taking sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on the "normal American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at a campaign meeting in North Carolina during a heavy rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "working," and the financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"Next week could be a decisive twist," said the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the present disaster is "the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy, as George Bush conducted and supported by Senator McCain."
The Senator of Illinois once again confirmed that despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans, and he also pointed out that the implementation of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided the questions concerning the $700 billion financial assistance plan (EUR 470 billion), which Congress adopted last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night after the closure of the polling rooms in the main square in Minsk to protest the irregularities of the elections to Parliament.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "Dictator, resignation."
Some admit that they did not even go to the elections: "What would be the point of doing whatever they want with my voice anyway, " says a young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to renegotiate negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, such as the ban on visas for 40 Belorussian chiefs and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census," complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "the important thing is who is counting the votes, and in our country it is executive power.
If any opposition Members make it to Parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean television, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by crises and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the course of the elections, should not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of an early vote (26% of the electorate in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there have been any elections?" asks the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There wasn't a foot in the polls.
And in Parliament there will be a maximum of five opposition Members, those who are most in line with the regime."
The night silence once again took place in the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - Blood That Is Sure Again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding yesterday and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and efficient suppliers of blood in the world.
First of all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after a blood-contaminated scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave of indolence to the public, the Canadian Government launched a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever was delaying his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee held this role.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Hema-Québec, who was to manage Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec started his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people had any confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was depressing.
We have regained the public's confidence over the next few years with constant efforts to increase the safety of blood products and permanent work in this area," he says and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008 Hema-Québek was already almost 94% of the population of Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of "confidence is something very fragile. "
Since its founding September 28, 1998 Hema-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
"Then we witnessed many cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has been leading the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread with blood.
We therefore relied on one of Krever's and Gélineau's basic recommendations, according to which if we do not know this and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, must be taken excruciating measures.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that the disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the principle of caution was meaningful."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: nucleic acid (NAT) tests that allow the donor blood to detect the presence of the virus itself and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests previously used were based.
The NAT tests have allowed the deaf period between the moment of the patient's infection and the moment when the first viruses can be detected by our blood techniques, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing and without finding out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV is now exposed to one person in 12 million.
" In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone gets HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years for the first case of transmission of HIV through a blood product to appear.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary to heal," says Hema-Québek's head of management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of disease element might appear in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by insect bites.
We must always be cautious," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that, in addition to safe supply, Hema-Québec must also count on sufficient supplies.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecs allowed for donation."
Each healthy person aged at least 18 years, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, which means six times a year.
On average 14% of people offering blood are not accepted because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria carriers, and if they have visited a land where mud fever is rampant, they are excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how old they are and no longer able to donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so loose today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are deposited with Hema-Québek, who also manages the only public blood bank from the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, has blood-rich stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood samples from the umbilical cord into the bank, and we assume that we will be taking over a thousand of them a year.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplantation," says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinal round of the first division of USL yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinals played on the total number of goals, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders of Seattle.
Backup Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-way goalless first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino netted the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Let us remember that on Friday during the first of the two matches of the quarterfinals the Impact suffered in the Starfire Complex in Tukwila on the suburb of Seattle defeat 2:1.
Impact will measure his power in the semifinals with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, Thunder settled the 3:1 deficit in the home game and finally won 4:3, but Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round with the total number of goals 5:4.
Impact should meet with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed only today.
Shortly - Kovalev's winning goal
Canadien's first attack trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekanec and Andrei Kosticin last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the greatest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev collected one pass in this fourth victory of three-colored of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need one more fight to make me feel good."
"In the first period he tried to handle too much," remarked Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice round of applause."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out an early election by the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party Congress (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebek, where today's next election is run by the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left).
"Drop the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually captivating manner at the end of the Lévis Lévis Liberal Party convention, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were shown behind his back in a sort of picture mill.
On three giant canvases ran a loop with remarkable shots of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the perspective of "Google Maps" , maps , etc.
Generous means, like in the election season.
In fact, at the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out early elections in the fall, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy program.
The "Plan North" constitutes the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, the vision of a "new economic space" that includes an agreement with France on labour, a convention between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that opening the North - northern territory to the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, he has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "knight with great potential" but did not give a deadline, an amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further divorced: especially hydropower plants, forests, but mainly the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's account, contains "the nickel, the zinc, the copper, the platinum, the gold, the silver, the iron, the titanium, and even the diamonds ".
This "territory twice the size of France is with us," "is in Quebec.
And it is not only with us, but it is within us," he emphasized, as if he wanted to show that he was referring to a national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, highlighted the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitib, Quebec engineering, James' bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after theatrical silence to see a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec always demanded, the Prime Minister specified during the press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all the governments so far.
There is one boundary line that no longer exists in the Convention, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, I will take that position again in the name of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "there is also a need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said when he spoke of the North-West crossing, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over the territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially to young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist Member from Ungava), have already launched negotiations with about 30 communities.
The activity was initiated by the Interministerial Committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "a common vision will be set."
Moreover, the development of the North should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "together designed, structured and environmentally sound," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a fluent follow-up to the vision of liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
After all, this was one of the still-shaked topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's entry into the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted suggests rebaptizing Beauharnois' headquarters at Adélard-Godbout's dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out the peaceful revolution and nationalization of water power, to Bourassus, who created James' bay, our party was able to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, premiere from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided in his member base, giving considerable applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of calling for elections in the autumn of this year, which allows him to do so by law.
However, he stressed that his program was charged, especially by the Federal Council missions in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend convention has provided the liberals' chiefs with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially certain "efforts to amend the constitution" which have gone very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Quebec Party) particularly calls for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council who would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was adopted skeptically in its main features.
PQ Chief (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois again pulled out the North Quebec development policy, which Landry's government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, she renounced its policy.
If she had stuck to it, "we would have moved on today," Marois remarked alongside her Jean-Talon candidate (where the elections are taking place today) by François Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"We wish, however, not to be mere theatre," said Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is coming back from the holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, ex-minister of "righteousness" in Harper's cabinet, who took the liberty of telling Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada last summer.
This humiliates a woman who has waged an endless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, that says a lot about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us that, as the only one of all Western countries involved, has not brought back to the homeland of its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that, at a time when the actions that were to be held against it were to take place, Omar Khadr was a young adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot under inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Associations of Canadian Lawyers advocate the retreat of Omar Khadr so that he can enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little cares that this young man is psychologically devastated next time, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torment.
We do not realize this, but we are witnessing the creepy erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words Harper is so wrapped up and which sounds so empty out of his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, mistreat him, imprison him according to the lib's will of a minority government (as it will be after October 14th....).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that proclaims virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has renounced what formed the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this waiver, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellovsky discourses of Barrick Gold
In September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, the executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, it confirms that the world's largest gold producer has begun prosecuting three authors and a poor little publishing house for insulting honor in order to provoke a "transparable public debate" and demands six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the event of prosecution for insult to honor, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver is completely passing away from this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to bankrupt anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums in order to be prepared to defend themselves and fight a very unbalanced fight against the army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Indeed, tactics in these unbalanced struggles often lie in ruining the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will clog the mouth of the counterparty and, moreover, frighten anyone who dares to pursue this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had her eye on the whole thing to present public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, Canada normally has a debate in the exchange of ideas, rather than in the blows with a baton.
Thus, mining companies were not enough to open their books, their documentation, and establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light into the matter.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion, and smahem rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice president's world refers only to fat-paid lawyers and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrow concept of this term.
In democracy, even the Nazis have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining companies.
The public is prepared to hear and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many see as prosecution, in which the defendant's mouth is to be blocked (in the context of his prosecution of the "public debate" by the way, Barrick has just called on Noir Canada's authors to officially announce that they are to stop using this term...).
Aside from Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of research and the search for truth that is essential to every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations which form the basis of intellectual activity itself.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not please rich companies in this world without exposing ourselves to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could have created it if it had followed the scientific standards that Noir Canada's authors use.
He has the right to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's exaggerated action clearly shows that, despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to hold a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would restrict such a type of wrongful prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operations - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the greatest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to slow down the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months with $700 billion has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms ensuring repayment of public money deposited, new measures to capture the quantities of buildings seized due to non-payment, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption of everyday life of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last few hours, negotiations have taken place to the utmost turn for fear of the effect of further failure on investors' state of mind.
The designated time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to negotiate later and both expressed their views on the agreement, but without neglecting to express their discontent that it was necessary to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with adding an agreement on certain measures, in particular those aimed at enabling owners to maintain their residence and the wage arrangements for the leading state of employment of the rescued companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on TV waves.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked by another station to vote in favour of the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I have read show that it is something that we will all have to spend and how it will be possible to move forward.
Inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan aims to buy off dubious claims and risk-free and unselling assets of US financial institutions for taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The decline in the first draft agreement last week was caused by Republican Members.
From the moment the Democrats agreed that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty would only be guaranteed by the government, but would not buy them out, there is a belief that the impossible situation is over.
In an effort to bring conflicting views closer to Congress, a measure has been added that the government will be able to introduce new charges to help it recover its deposit if, as a result of the programme, it has to take up losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in rescued companies that will pay him dividends in the event of profit and which he will be able to sell again when this is over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the real estate seizure procedures associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The authors of the plan would like to put him to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will have a green light.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project in both Republican and democratic camps.
"It is quite clear that Washington cannot hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, Member of the House's Financial Commission, at the address of the voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But earning money from taxpayers is not the solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, presenter of a group of congressmen nicknamed "the skeptical committee," presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"The four hundred esteemed professors of economics, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again confirmed that this crisis was a global crisis.
At the end of the emergency meeting, three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11,2 billion (USD 16,3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it had withdrawn from buying its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2,9 billion) as a result of the US housing credit crisis.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, one of the 20 largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
"We will not lose this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we acquire the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that is what savers and households can appreciate today's uncertain times."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, it seems that the British government has launched the nationalisation of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than USD 41 billion ($75,5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to yesterday's announcement, branches and accounts of British bank clients will be purchased by Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor break out with a charming smile of narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unstoppable talent he possessed also distanced him from the force category that produced real stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 at his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinematography.
Less magnificent than Brando, to whom he was similar and for a long time was a rival on a film screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often breeds beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother originally Hungarian.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because this whole country was in love with a self made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then visited New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the theatre, on television and early in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed second at a 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, despite the fact that since 1958 he has been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward.
It also leaves the dark spots of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of its own show-business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the most noble sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused the film lovers dizzy, while his big roles compete on the black canvas of memories.
More than half a century later, he's been defiling the ever-changing American seventh art.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) reappears in memory, a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a hot roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From the less ancient past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
So many more Newman Pauls have gone into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, an abused, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the Sign of Hate) by Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken over after his death, who in 1956 introduced Newman as a true acquaintance.
Sympathic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Poraz), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
Bitter and vindictive pool player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character will be portrayed in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which will bring him a single Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering for ages, it was him.
And him again.
In his professional career, they compete with different epochs.
Young people know it mainly thanks to the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then closed his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several movie legends that had left the craft quite soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with his platitudes, pomp and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "a live challenge of underplaying," judging that he pushed him too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, scumbags, and desperate ones whose decline and rebellion reflected in his perfect features.
As director Newman, he revealed the few known aspects of his shy sensitivity.
His film Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (according to a novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the lead, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, Harry and Son dedicated a work of shame and sadness to his son, Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose.
His great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared: "His presence made my life better and this country better. "
Generosity, love of life, such are the main qualities of a dead actor.
Aside from his legendary career, there is also a great civil rights fighter, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of Hollywood's decline.
We used to see his portrait on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, cookies and other foods, which might have seemed rather tacky to us, although it was a gag at first.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Hard Childhood.
So, rather than being lulled with glory, Newman was engaged in society until the last moment.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and to the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to watch the career of such a psychic and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the invoice factory Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on October 8th, the trial will begin against János Zuschlag and his associates.
In addition to other criminal offences, including forgery of documents, politicians and their associates are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematically criminal organisation resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecution, they used money obtained in competitions for their own purposes and often supported tasks with fictional invoices.
The money from the state and government - in total about 65 million forints - went partly to the Fiatal Baloldal cash register, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The way in which the investigating authority also informed the investigating authority was that the money received in the competitions was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual consideration and the commitments made by the association were never met.
According to the prosecution, a large proportion of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Yózsefváros market and round stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
The names on which companies are to produce invoices were decided, among other things, on a roundabout road along the north bank of Balaton, on which István Lados János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was supposed to look for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them he applied for bills for his consumption, according to whose model invoices were then produced in public competitions written by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Self-administration of the Capital City.
István Lados was mostly exhibiting invoices with his companion András ©rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip, " Lados saw a beerhouse.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitality establishment provided catering for a 90-member group from Biztos Pont.
However, according to the manager, so many people would suddenly not fit into this facility.
It was also crawling with formal and content errors of the invoice issued in summer 2002 by a foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
Guesthouse in Badacsonytomai had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet there were 150 guests on the invoice.
The fillers of forms with rich fantasies, however, overreacted even when they put on documents the company also engaged in hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts according to the information provided to the state prosecutor, documents sounding in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear.
The head of Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that these were fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from formalities, it was not agreed that they had accommodated a hundred people according to the invoice, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, there was also food on the invoice, and their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The jealous invoice producers did not even convince themselves that the Budapest travel agency was looking for foreign travel only, and the cash payment invoice, which also did not correspond to the company's billing practice, reported foolishly as a travel agent for Hungary.
Moreover, as has been shown in the course of the investigation, they also stated VAT in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
The four documents issued by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. disagreed with, inter alia, the amount of VAT. The company's activities were not covered by the said 25% but 15% VAT, while the hotel's employees only exhibited printed invoices, but the invoice was produced by hand.
In addition, they corrupted the "publishers" invoice, for example, by stating to one company how it came out thanks to the prosecution's investigation, as an activity carried out by road transport of goods, which the company originally based on investment advice did not carry out.
The fact that the invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and the XXI associations are false invoices is also due to formal deviations - an inadequate invoice format and an incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the forgers did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyiregaháza was in liquidation at the time of (2001) when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating with it, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
Invoices were consciously exhibited
The second group of invoices is made by those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of the company Collab s. r. o. ordered the prosecution to issue a fictional account one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
The company Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and his associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő Foundation with invoices worth about five million forints for which there was no actual economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created later were cancelled, which the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies include those who had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian Managing Director of Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer resources worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which had been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom he was to pass the papers on the company also Iván Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppa and the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and himself accepted their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatova, Romanian bricklayers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get a job.
However, the companies benefited him because, at the request of the co-indicted lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The D.A. concluded that Kubatov had arrived at 10 percent of the amounts shown on invoices and VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri k.t. to issue fictitious invoices, this time to tender for Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals for the Mihály Táncsics (TMA) Foundation's tender, a publicly beneficial socialist organisation.
They obtained over 500,000 forints, but did not spend on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to come out, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a search at the office of Arpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial part of the defendants will probably describe the course of the production of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if he decides to reveal everything himself the main defendant János Zuschlag.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will explain everything in detail, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, maybe the Socialists made a deal with him and Zusi will take the blame.
After all, he may have been offended, as his requests to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely the placing in house arrest, remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much more damage that they have not yet paid, are free to walk or at least wait for the end of their proceedings in their homes, he does not have that option.
Trumping Psychology: Why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of New York University.
According to their study, published in Science, people don't want to fall behind in eBay auction-type competitions, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Research was using an experimental auction to map the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers planted, the other group participated in a staged auction, using a functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) to examine the active areas of the brain of test subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game, the important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex called stratum began to work intensively when losing.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to researchers, it is therefore possible to explain the effort to avoid a severe reaction of the striata.
To support their theory, members of the economists research team conducted a financial cross-cutting investigation.
On various conditions, three groups were criticized against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was and they made the bets.
Moreover, members of another group were promised that if they came out victorious, they would still receive $15 for a reward.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of the loss, its members lost the money.
So the difference between the two groups was all about winning and losing.
Of course, members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
Those have so far explained the phenomena observed in auctions by the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Up to neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of New York University Economics.
Hepatitis: when to seek medical advice?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death in Hungary.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are treated, and the reason for this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, the inflammation of the liver and jaundice is characteristic, but the agents of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
The hepatitis viruses, depending on the agents of the disease, are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e. g. infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva).
In any case, travelers should be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus type C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after ingestion of an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
Then the skin and eye whites develop jaundice, lighten stool and darken urine. The treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people around the world die of a more serious type of disease, liver cancer, and hepatitis B-induced cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only 1 in 10 infected patients are treated with medication.
hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells insidiously, so the first symptoms occur in many cases up to 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early prevention, regular writing is very important.
In three groups, the disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users and between people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already demonstrate a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his physician if he records any signs of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the organism, preventing contagion and preventing cancer.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was organized for the first time worldwide by organisations representing the sick in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God acts as a kind of analgesic that could make death easier for Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how a person's belief in a god of perception of pain was influenced, reported the British daily Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all watched the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examines the human brain in detail, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
Research is the first of a series of researches involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
Exactly the test was carried out by attaching a sparking instrument to the test subject's left hand, which gave rise to electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to watch two paintings: the Sassoferrat Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with the Edge of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would bring about a certain state of piety in the believers, while Da Vinci's painting was chosen because it was not very different from the first and seemed to be a comforting impression.
The test subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time they received in four consecutive parts 20 electroshocks while watching separately the picture with religious or general themes.
Catholics reported that looking at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe " as if they had been" cared for " and" calmed down, filled with peace. "
They felt 12 percent less pain in view of the religious image than when Leonardo's work was before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved using any highly impressive image even in atheists, just need to find the right photograph.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," said the psychologist.
Bishop Tom Wright of England welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such excellent results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of believers if they showed them a Madonna by Leonard or a painter of similar caliber.
Would the view of a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you share
On their tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations they are taking and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
But as for the skeptics paralleling the Orwellian dark vision, the very essence of the 2.0 website is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently commented for the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google's founders to stick to their original purpose, which was: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to Google's rumoured representative, after ten years of world-class work, the company is only at the beginning of working with all the information.
To the question, what will be five years from now, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like, "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of work would be actually suitable for me?" - such seemingly simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until they know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during the Internet search, exactly what searched words and what IP address were searched for and what pages were moved to after the search.
Thanks to Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, retain the history of their surfing, look back at what they were looking for and clicked on, thus generating in the long term findings adapted to them much more directly - the same logic will be based on the service Recommendations, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data are used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - they ask users who are afraid to look at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is more threatening, counter-reaction does not create guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all search terms are not only captured, but may also be issued to third parties in justified cases, in such legal cases personal rights of Internet users are not protected.
The most famous example of recent events was probably coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that enabled the identification of paedophiles from the community site of Orkut, established through it.
However, Internet users who are worried about personal rights could still relax in May when the company successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI in the protection of electronic rights organization EFF: Google must not be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI even in the future by any article of the Constitution.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of searched expressions, which it received with reference to strengthening the child protection law adopted years ago, but still failed to get lists of searched items of individual users, respectively complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear the provision of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be exposed by using Google services, and they are opposed to it with a revolt, which belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, see it as a new generation of big companies, "corporation that now runs," unlike his rival Microsoft, considered by Windows as conquerors of the world, however both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, more youthful, "cooler" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it can also be caused by the fact that geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought with it just one of the most tilted keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave tracks behind and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although their scope is different, the essence remains the same: we are showing up.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily connect with other services such as Twitter or last.fm, recording his listening music, all of which can be connected to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to writing a blog that automatically features his latest photogallery that he stores on Flickr or Picase.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases that explain: a girlfriend in the morning looking at a flood of photos of her friends easily discovers who her crazy boyfriend spent the evening with, or the company can fire its employee just because the blog reveals its sincere opinion of the senior management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely re-evaluated today.
The person who lives an online life consists of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And who wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (from Scroogle, which uses Google's search system, however, deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a small number of people do not register on community sites to be found. Online Google apps from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not create the best possible profile.
Public opinion isn't very secretly expecting Google to show teeth.
The company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites threaten investment in advertising agencies and services introduced at a constantly accelerating rate make life very difficult not only to Microsoft but also to numerous other software designers.
In addition, critical observers find counterpointing causing a disturbing impression: for example, the senior management rejected the staff's protests after raising to double the fee for the company's kindergarten, any frequent daily meals of employees were too expensive according to the company's management, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google was still bowing to the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, will filter out any finding that defies good taste, or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance until it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can cheat the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines acquires such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile of our own with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for subsequent generations of science fiction writers, the famous novel Cory Doctorow "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which one can get scary close only with Google data.
The double-killer from Ozid helped remove the tracks of two juveniles.
Two juveniles were interrogated by the police in the case of double-murder in Ozd, and, according to reasonable suspicion, they helped eliminate the traces of this crime, said the spokesperson of Borsod County High Police Directorate on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activities of which they were suspected and are currently being charged with aiding the crime.
Both juveniles, according to MTI information, two girls are being prosecuted at large.
Assistance to a criminal offence shall be punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to five years.
Suspected of double murder in Ozd, 23-year-old male here, was taken into interim custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a felony planned multiple murders for self-inflicted reasons.
During the investigation, it turns out that a 23 - year - old man owed a larger amount to a 53 - year - old man.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, which is why he lured his creditor to an establishment in Ozdo last Wednesday, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was preparing for committing the crime in advance, suggesting that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100% share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the State is the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of a Polish state that wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to interested parties for the Prague exchange so far.
According to Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börs have so far submitted an offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not exclude that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold out.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25% stake, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the perspective of European sheets
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading newspaper already resembles the "second September 11th."
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the US President, press charges against Roman La Repubblica. The president was not even able to sew up his own party to support the quick-plated bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which was like a billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about September the second.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo, the world economy was on the brink of a collapse in its lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of America's financial system continues to rise, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political solution to the crisis after the vote in Congress.
The world economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in capitalism's history is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw staggering money institutions a rescue circle, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
But if other banks collapse like dominatrixes, then neither money nor improvisation will be enough.
In the long run, the Member States of the European Union need to move over their national egoism and unite control over the broken financial markets.
On Monday alone, they received more than €100 billion in hard money constitutions, reminding Vienna's Der Standard that they fear that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to go deep into their pockets in order to resolve the crisis, more and more real.
The European Union has not really dealt with the crisis that is going on as a tsunami on the old continent until now.
"Equipors" may not immediately wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good for them to make a firm determination in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
An intelligent car mimics a bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitations of barriers occurring in the world of nature?
Bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of a surprise project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, inspired engineers from Nissan bumblebees. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has designed a biomimetic robotic control system type BR23C, a robotized miniaut that is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate any precipitation.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety cover," explained Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technological PR and research and development.
Folding eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see in all directions at an angle of vision of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the composite eye function, engineers reached for the idea of a laser ranger.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres in front of BR23C in the 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation to prevent collision.
The obstacle is detected within a fraction of a second, then the robotized car starts mimicking the movements of the bee and turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this deflecting manoeuvre takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, a robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, Head of Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety packaging, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not last longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensional and only in a direction that can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees in avoiding them, only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer lifespans than lithium ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent reactions are important, not the ability to process, the less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond only to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to keep them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so he keeps using only memory of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with giga- or megabajt capacity.
This is the first step towards developing an instant avoidance technology that, according to Nissan's estimate, could reach serially manufactured vehicles within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be to connect the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified final destination after avoiding obstacles.
A damn dear child has a name
The $700 billion economic rescue package, which is to be divided into several instalments and aimed at buying off low-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight of US Eastern Time, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days' debate on a $700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which there is only an agreement to be drawn up.
Both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the compromise on the package.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson stated about the compromise: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further action needs to be taken. "
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2:00 a.m. Central European time), but no special increase in stock exchanges caused.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the proposal for a legislative standard, which is in the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, and then it will be the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then they welcomed the news of the agreement to the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night, and we greatly appreciate both sides' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said White House spokesperson Tony Fratto.
Indeed, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, in which it was meant to be about spending the entire sum of $700 billion on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now it is possible to spend a maximum of half of 700 billion in the first, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after Congress decides on matters on Monday, and the Treasury will buy mortgage-backed securities that are classified as poor, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the president's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special body, whose member will also be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The spending of the second half of $700 billion will depend on another Congress decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply combined tactics within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities or other "poisoned" loans.
The purchase can take place both within the auction and directly, communicated by the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will guarantee them funds which constitute a cause for concern, for which the company will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the large money institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank bosses who are in trouble and waiting to help the state can count on the government to cut their severance payments - simply called "gold parachute" in the overseas slang.
They will only be limited in certain cases, and these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The limitation basically means that if the Ministry buys within the auction, a tax premium will be imposed on the golden parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of direct buy-in of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order not to overestimate the money for management.
It must be added that the existing contracts on golden parachutes will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which is to be another stimulus for participation in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history when the legal limitation on the remuneration of CEOs will be in force," commented Barney Frank, Democrat, Chairman of the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the State will be entitled to a share in the banks participating in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the rescued bank, together with it, can also make money from the transaction.
The draft plan contains that, in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how taxpayers can be recovered the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides expressing doubts in relation to the plan.
"This is not what American citizens asked us to do, because this is not something that will protect taxpayers' dollars," said the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that exactly those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street urged the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, by 12,9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.

Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industry also slightly increased by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to the month-on-month increase in prices in the bag and saddlery products industry by 4.6 percent, or to the production of footwear by 2.5 percent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product industries (1.6%).
Prices decreased in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other manufacturing industries, we measured price increases between 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sectors, which have a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly by the continued effect of the officially established increase in gas prices as of 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual industries, prices increased most in the oil processing industry (32.4 percent).
In the manufacturing sector, 13.2% were observed, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which have a decisive weight, and in the 11 percent price increase.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile product industries (2,5 percent) and the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 percent).
In other manufacturing industries, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry increased by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sector exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
From the point of view of the sector's focus, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the production sectors of tangible assets was seen in domestic sales in August.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, in the energy of processing and further processing sectors, prices did not change due to the previous month.
The biggest price increase due to the same month preceding the year was observed in August 2008 in the energy of processing and further processing industries (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods industries, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, but for tangible assets, prices dropped by 1.4 percent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3.9 percent in 12 months.
Our domestic currency has weakened by 1.7 percent in one month due to the euro, by 7.1 percent in relation to the dollar, by 7.5 percent in comparison to August 2007 and by 15.9 percent in relation to the dollar.
Next year, to the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "it is almost all that matters now that an electronic system of travel authorisation or checks is being built in time across the sea."
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include admission permits, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy from today continues negotiations in Washington.
She will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order for Merit on the Republic of Hungary and conduct interviews with advisors for foreign policy Presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, on Sunday, gave the $700 billion government bailout package, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a few days of marathon meeting of Congress and administrative representatives, early Sunday morning was announced: a basic agreement was concluded on the bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims at remelting the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue for the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are equally referred to as more appropriate from both candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, Obama regained some advantage at the forefront of the economic question, and McCain's lead vanished after the Republican Convention for the nomination of Sarah Palin as Vice President.
Obama expressed the hope that the 700 billion package bill would be quickly adopted by Congress at the Detroit election meeting on Sunday.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) to your places, to savings, to the entire industry, to the stability of the entire economy is in danger," he said in front of the 35,000th crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain explained in an interview provided by the ABC television station: "It will all be a bit awful (...) but nothing doing is simply not a possible way. "
As the Republican Senator said, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission supervising the Minister of Finance and the limitation of severance payments for the senior officials he insisted on.
Obama said for CBS that McCain did not have a more important role in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House, announced on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill on perhaps Monday.
Overview of printing of the German language area
Right-wing camp is intact, only voters inside it became more confident - so it analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers."
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of CSU began a long time before the sad duo of Beckstein-Huber took over.
For decades, Christian socialists have restored Bavaria - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
Changing seasons is a problem for the entire Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
Debacle was not surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process ended, which could be expected for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50% threshold.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, i.e. still in the so often mentioned Stoiber period.
The reason for this is the modernisation that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that consumes its parents.
Secularization, education results, the settlement of Germans from the East and the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequences for the integrity of the CSU voters.
Modernization is linked to the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
Right-wing camp is intact, only voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more headstrong.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the CSU has been most distant from the classic civil classes; people in the free profession, tradesmen, seniors and higher education.
This shrunk CSU support below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who, with whom? The party chairmen are modest in the coalition's questions, the Viennese daily devotes itself to the confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP forbade the involvement of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the greens do not want to negotiate with the coalition yet.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party chairmen did not get much insight into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in social partnership there is.
The question whether he can imagine the coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, as vice chancellor, has left Faymann open.
As he said, Schüssel-Molterer's course was outvoted at every turn.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer responded carefully to the red menus.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues must be discussed decisively within ÖVP.
The president of BZÖ Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóková: It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which hosts France this year, the current President of the State of the European Union, has begun.
Lívia Járóková, a Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers in her message addressed to plenary, turned attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The summit opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meetings were held between the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Járóková Group of MEPs, she pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that is taking place during recruitment, Romani people are pushed out of the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Romani people do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education."
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Romani children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to confirm the awareness of these contexts in the broadest circles - between Romani and non-Romani children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the more chance he will have of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma are entitled to their citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their poor quality and separate education," Lívia Járóková pointed out.
According to the Member, the European Union's cohesion is needed, with emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, in order to speed up the processes of school desegregation immediately, and this is essential in keeping with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; it is necessary to give Romani children the opportunity given to democratic space so that they can participate as full-right citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková requested.
Each of them is guaranteed, in the sign of 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', the objective of the European Summit of Equality, organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and eliminate discrimination, set at European and national level.
CSU: temporary pardon
The fate of the Duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has not yet fallen, so far the CSU in Bavaria has been adjourned.
The chairman of Erwin Huber and the country's Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is, when will this grace last?
The fate of a tandem who suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, members of a highly criticized duo let themselves be heard that they would not cling to their posts with all their strength.
So they tried to calm the angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavoric tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago, under Edmund Stoiber's leadership, the Christian-social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent was enough.
CSU has been a "self-government" in Bavaria producing 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years.
Although conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, remain in a high position, they will in any case be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first features of the reorganisation within the party is the fact that the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a possible Huber successor, will also be a member of a narrow intelligence team that launches a probing discussion on a possible coalition of Munich's government with a liberal FDP, or with a right-wing group of Free Voters.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to execute the coup, came to the assembly, but then with an ambitious municipal politician, they made a mercilessly short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, Stoiber will also play an active role, who has so far been spinning strings from the background, the former prime minister of the country and the former chairman of the CSU called the most bitter day of his political career on September 28.
On Monday Huber made a few sneaky remarks to CDU, according to him, they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in national success in 2005, has somehow taken a stand together.
According to Merkel, who was hard to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU's positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin's great coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the Socialist crisis continues.
The SPD has achieved the lowest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko:position - 110:0
In the Sunday elections, not a single opposition Member made it to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the welfare and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the lawlessness that occurred in the census.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislative body of 10 million countries has been lacking opposition for ten years, the opposition brought together under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who, on the basis of a change in the constitution in the 2006 elections, and for the fourth time, had kept his presidential mandate renewed, would "allow" several opposition MEPs to appear in Parliament.
The ODS also abandoned the boycott previously considered.
In the background of opposition expectations, Beltransgaz, the country-running gas pipelines, was increasingly dependent on Russia - which wanted to mitigate the impact of the ever-expensive Russian gas import to take credit and also contributed to the Russian-owned Beltransgaz company, which was in possession of gas pipelines - to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to Belarus's political establishment as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians do not receive entry permits.
The release earlier pointed out that the OSCE's assessment of the election campaign highlighted positive shifts rather than shortcomings - such as the ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's Monday lightning report already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could essentially not appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition cannot be present with a vote census.
At the same time, the opposition believes that it is possible to feel better in the political system: political prisoners have been released to freedom and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow as well as smaller confrontations when it continues to refuse to recognise the isolated South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is a Union state on paper, has considered these two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," he told our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to keep it that way, despite the fact that "a single member of the opposition has become too frightened to enter a meaningless parliament. "
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, distribution puts obstacles to local authorities, but I see that more and more people support change, even among the elders," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers its greatest success to be the creation of social security, does not consider the right or officially most supported class of pensioners.
"Because of the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'inducing the silence of the cemetery' collapses', says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition politics, Russian observers regarded elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, the head of the Community of Independent States mission to the Russian intelligence agency Rio Novosti, said that "people do not believe words but actions," so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been introduced on the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from now on, this new measure will start to work against cunning people, against those who inject themselves and then go out for coffee at work.
A novelty against the lazy was introduced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving door - says Brunetta - is an instrument for better work, higher performance, more presentations and more services," the minister states.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will be opened.
This is reformism," Brunette emphasizes.
The Chigi Palace will complete its implementation in all Council Presidency buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view. "
There were no objections from the employees, the Secretary General assures: "This was a joint procedure with the workers and the cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunette smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister finally announces that within three months the absence of public servants for the disease has decreased by 50%, i.e. by 60,000 people more per year at work."
It will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"her payout dynamic - explains the Minister - has doubled over the past 8-10 years due to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage"
In the meantime, thousands of public employees have gathered to reject the standards of the Brunette Decree in line with the application supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Administration today presents figures concerning a lower absence from work due to illness - writes the consumer protection association - the nation of 'a busy lazy people' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public servants who have gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree."
Taru will be protested against the exclusion of sickness benefits, which depends on the activity; the extension of the time within which the patient can be checked for the time limit of the inspection visits and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, there will be 2,500 accidents at work in Italy, three people will die and 27 will remain permanently disabled.
Inail's figures confirm that we have about 1,200 deaths in 2007 as a result of accidents at work.
These values indicate the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the death compared to the murders.
In order to restore the attention of institutions, social and information resources regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil is now celebrating the 58th national day of the victims of accidents at work on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of the issue of safety of work" confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for Mutilation and Disabilities for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his lively admiration for the constant joint effort to secure jobs, to protect injured workers, to help the families of victims and to contribute to public opinion."
"Naturally, an outraged 'enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies, which, by their extent, cause a stir in the media and public opinion, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even recurring in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
A number of initiatives in the field of education are of particular importance so that young people facing the world of work gain clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed that "the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social condition, as he insults each of us's conscience and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring an end to this situation."
"As regards the data on accidents at work, they seem to have a positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of an accident at work is alarming," said President Anmil Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We wouldn't exactly want this reduction effort to lead to less attention, because just when the attention stops, tragedy will break out.
"We believe that there is generally too little to do to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion - stressed by Mercandelli - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from the school's age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and participation in public opinion.
But, above all, a greater sense of responsibility is needed by employers towards a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon ."
In the end, Mercandelli said that it was a progressive degeneration of the levels of the right to compensation foreseen for the work victims and the "sendout of support care" that the system has been coming to in recent years. "
"The aim is to give the worker back the guarantee of insurance - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gift from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 Players charged, putting hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable musical devices as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to the announcement published today by the European Commission, which, in an official report published in Brussels, quotes the view of the Community for the Science of Health Risks that have recently arisen and have been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"It follows from this scientific view - we read in the notes - that 5-10% of those listening to music for at least five years by means of portable musical instruments, over an hour a week, and keeping the apparatus high in volume, risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who often use portable musical devices and mobile phones on high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way" admits Meglen Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - the leader continues - show a clear risk and need to respond quickly.
The most important thing is that we must encourage consumers to publish this information.
We must continue to examine the already existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them quite effective and to keep up with the new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Community to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists - closed by executive official Eu - confirm that there is a need to worry, and now the European Commission, together with the other members and parties who raised the problem, will examine what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices'.
At present, there is a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are increasing concerns about hearing damage, which may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to limit these damages very much by looking for solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, will exceed the limits currently in force corresponding to maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a longer period of time risk lasting hearing loss after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantities can be calculated between 2,5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission run free for the future of the capital
Today we begin, in March we close, in June we will have the sums.
This is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" staff who met this morning at their new headquarters behind the Caracall Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up a handbook for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will assess the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councilman Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and it includes all political, social and cultural ideas - it wants to emphasise Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political judges, which remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
It is not about any exchange of functions, but only about trying to have some place where to process a great project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact deadline.
In June - the Mayor announces - we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome'.
He who accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness, given that its views are not binding, will answer Alemann: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, like the Commission's Attali proposals, and I am sure of it in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics smacks into everyday problems and on the urgency that occurs from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither a useless enterprise nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, Roman citizens will not cost a euro and will serve to think and involve the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemann, basically, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor stationary, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level that it urgently needs, and to think of its future with a united spirit. "
The future, which states the mayor of Rome, "will not only be confined to current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital city, but "also includes the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A famous American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. "
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obama are growing just as the election date is approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama has a lot of nerve: he thinks he's going to get to the highest post of the nation, who has all two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks do not say much"; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then we have surveys; they all say that Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the bowels of the south of the United States, commented: at least once in the polling booth, we know well who the American patriot will give his vote to.
One aspect of America's mentality, which remained in motion until the very last moment, is to be seen.
Say what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to check, whether Obama or McCain"?
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
4,500 soldiers lost their lives in Iraq, and Americans weren't forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became mostly Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes Georgia W's place will have to perform a huge task.
The US's economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: there is an investigation period in the paper, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of printed matter.
The PEW Research Center has asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption regarding the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say that they had less concern about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis destroyed by the economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the paper, are a huge problem.
According to the surveyed journalists, this is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to change fundamentally, as the general public understand it.
A clear but complex pessimism penetrates the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors believe that journalism is going the wrong way on a national scale.
There is an executive group of 65% in the local area.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the website is going.
Greater publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of printed material.
"Economic pressure" reported by journalists increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists have admitted that they are resorting to technology in the hope that they "will do something good " for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - that is, leaders - and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value is falling to 23%.
This has something to do with somebody's job security.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're at 30%.
With regard to "certain work" regarding personnel (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still a daily order.
Only 13% of journalists are working on a contract.
In such a huge nation as Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and Internet employers often offer what they want, so they are asked to take or leave them.
Managers get almost always huge salaries, and the editor can earn $10,000 a month off pension and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It is only a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGE IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the submission of a businessman with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who has asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the counteroffer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process, at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate businessman could change his whereabouts from a rural town to a capital city.
However, according to the court, this transfer (against which he has expressed his pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that they accuse him of.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon appeared a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against a $700 billion bailout plan presented by the White House: a large proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is torn apart by the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, milder, more friendly to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to "the ones of Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the countries of central and south.
A soul that was arrogantly expressed by the vote I was talking about in the beginning...
However, this very point is merely an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake has already shown: not just in the United States, but in the West, and perhaps not just here.
In both Usa and Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator for phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, which have been building up and finally coming out of the light in the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is realization, extraordinary market recovery, double State-power categories in relation to certain renationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis of financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country are primarily included in a single state.
This has also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, which are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of the picture or that it has nothing much to add: obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide for one common political line.
And so everyone awaits the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the recovery of the market, the new rules and, above all, the division of funds: when we get into distress, only states have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to fix everything.
And it also has the necessary means and authority to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances which no market and any international organisation may ever be able to have to a similar degree.
This new emphase, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, moreover, in complete harmony with the increasing importance that the latest economic progress tries to attach to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom of the Sita, increasingly sophisticated technology, even material, while we were convinced that global finance had already been destined to rule the world, all of a sudden we realized that our future would have to deal more and more with things such as water, grain, oil.
All things that would have been said can be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the enclosed space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up his sleeve than who isn't and who has the bad luck of living in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it predicts a break.
Who talks about territory, state, government, inevitably talks about politics, i.e. leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, it seems that two convergent phenomena are being created.
On the one hand, realizing that there is objectively a need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can seize the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leadership, particularly economic, which has proved equally inconvenient and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence, which is trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
In fact, it seems that it is growing more and more widely in the masses of the population of conviction than in order for their actions to be the same as the ideas of the still popular elites as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has overcome its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from the underground, but a strong movement for the removal of ruling classes and traditional political order manifests itself in sudden electoral "surveillance" or in unexpected changes in collective moods in recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavan to the fall of Labourers in the UK, to the revolt of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasing problems to understand, i.e. to represent, which, not from now on, is being created in deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, growing, potentially over-clouding.
Before this, it would be excessive to talk about permanent "mass rebellion."
But we certainly can't say it means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centers and now a team of four institutes have come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep the stoilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of just two inches square.
STUDIO - American journal Science published discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
"The basis of glue can be imagined as a series of pipes laid as an ordered pile of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired themselves with the feet of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that enable the animal to provide a perfect stick.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "simply removes itself from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Engineering Faculty of Dayton University.
"This material could be useful as a temporary glue" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk around walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers think of a far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are heat and electrical conductors.
Other applications could relate to aerial space engineering.
No superheroes for now.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkley, California, is also involved in research into new glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented glue formed from micro fibres as hair, which cleanses itself from dust by moving across the surface to maintain perfect adjoining.
Medications: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their ingestion changes amplification or reduced effectiveness with serious health consequences.
So that David Bailey, Professor of Western Ontario University in London, emphasizes the risks of both finished and fresh juices in combination with the intake of certain medicines, to the currently ongoing 263th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, raises a new alarm: one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects and to expose patients' health to risk.
grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the toxic level of effects of some anti-arithmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
THE Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in the newsletter two years ago and urged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that reduce drugs.
Long list of effects reduced by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the challenge of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacological department of the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are mostly immediately announced to various international and national pharmacies agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So read always the illustrative medication cards you get and if you encounter anything unclear, do not be alarmed, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification" emphasized Ansa's expert.
Nobel for Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55 - year - old Novokenan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well - known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political actions.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, on the days of Enron's collapse, Krugman predicted in one comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be much more important than the first one in terms of the effects on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked a few controversy and that has been reproached for years, but which has proved accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at the rate of collapse such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "economic of great importance" but also a popularator who has a very aggressive style, particularly critical of Bush's liberalist administration's excesses.
Open Office, we have a third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
It is the day of publication of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production, which aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work by volunteer workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with various innovations: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window add another, much more substantial, as compatibility for Apple Mac OS X and support for the new ODF format (ODF Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as what allows to reduce PowerPoint presentation dimensions, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF folder to the graphic design model and maintain the original page appearance.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes; in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color for comments to make it clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies also work on the transfer of some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should present a definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, added to the English version located on the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd can also be sent home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the theme of freeness can be a means of enlargement in households, it is the Open Office business area that places a lot of bets on the package, and it can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, ultimately, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are at almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this figure can also be overcome.
Also the results of Kohl are positive, it's the fourth case of doping
The new positive case on the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the team Gerolsteiner, the third classified and winner of the top top t-shirt.
L'Equipe's website quoted the report.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor positive for Cere, Epo third generation, after Italians Riccard Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra.
If the control analysis confirms the positivity of Cere, Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the specified two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positivity on Epo 3rd Generation confirms the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government about the outcome.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the podium of the winners behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastr and American Cadel Evansem, and has also gained a dotted shirt of the best top cheerleader.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES IS ITALIE RASIST?
Italy, "as a country of immigrants, has only turned into a priority target for immigrants in the last home" accepted with opposition.
It transforms a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So they ask in a long article by the New York Times, which devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guiber, originally from Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month because he stole a box of cookies.
This case makes what the New York Times define as "the paradox of the north": the northern areas are also those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League."
To confirm the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by Lega, which is trying to hinder immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of changing climate in Italy.
Tendence emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedetto XVI in Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The market rents for university students do not know the crisis.
According to Sunia's recent research, the tenants' union, rent a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The phenomenon has already reached such a size that the entire classes of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure - explains the head of the office for Sunia studies, Laura Mariani - in this city, the great demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has prompted the process of increasing prices, which has spread to residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without limited rent, related subleases.
For Sunji, exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices due to the tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros per bed, the single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to the maximum 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room of about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, it takes 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in single.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in double.
The values are slightly lower (550 euro per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room of Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, it takes 300/450 euros per bed, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policelinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros per bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have more impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rent is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, one further anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of approximately 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students compared to Italian students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"The city without cinemas is like a blind, like a face without eyes."
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multi-sales in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a real cultural crime.
"It is as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a long journey and a lot of emotions," the director of the New Theatre, Paradiso, a film that was awarded to Tornator Oscar twenty years ago and a grand jury prize in Cannes, who told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness about a way of life that probably lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: during the last five years 316 cinemas of traditional tip closed the door, and the highest bill paid mainly halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torino, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure is Emilia-Romagna, with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first one responsible for their disappearance is the emergence of a multiplex is these three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinema multisales: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian process has evolved unracionally" claims Paolo Protti, President Anecu,"is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive because when one cinema closes in the city, not all of its visitors are willing to move into a multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about the lack of fund subsidies for operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year to support the sector."
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closure and which decided to find its way out by signing the protocul between the village and Anec, the first type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax relief for operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: the audience will be able to enter the restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
"I like this initiative" says Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures"
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
Defence of the traditional cinema is a topic that was important for all time: closing the Super cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a spark that convinced me to start the "New cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I'm walking through the already closed Rialto or Quirinal on Nazionale Street, where I've shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at signs blackened with dust, I turn to the other side."
Link between politics and the mob group 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city's election according to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia Group."
The charges brought by the Directorate against the Mafia in Calabria against Mayor and Vice Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarn Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old liaison between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's lawyer, the chief namesake, already accused of committing crimes of mafia nature, sentenced to payment of 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay the consultation to Piromalli.
"So they would allow the Mafia group - written by judges - to officially enter the city authorities and thus facilitate the already huge possibilities of public administration control and management"
Agazio Loiero, the President of the Kalábrian Regional Commission, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organized criminal underworld are a lot in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still immaculate'.
The prisons of this morning follow the imprisonment of July last year, by which the police have shown that the Piromalli mob group has received a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the City Council of Gioi Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was also the supposed link between organized crime and local administration - local politicians have been deprived of office in municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the moment of dissolution was elected head of the coalition of the right center after a narrower election in May.
He was screaming about a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the municipal council to be dissolved.
He called to account the then Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti and accused him of making everything politically possible, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that the mob group had even reached such a point that they had asked for a change to the A3 motorway project.
From other interviews ordered against Dal Torrion, public prosecutors write, "the willingness to move the demands of an entrepreneur, representatives of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt public administration elections to the interests of the Mafia group."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It is an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now being discovered by large global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy that hold the sight of colossals like Chevron, who now tries to lay hands on these resources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s, research has intensified in connection with the first oil crisis.
When the oil price went down around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away, but now the environmental organisation and the new increase in oil price gave the sector a new impetus.
In 2007, the World Energy Council (WEC) in London stated that around 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the wave movement of the seas.
this amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
Plus, there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology - a spokesperson for a company that is connected to the United States' oil colossus, in the Wall Street Journal's daily economic newspaper - and they are thinking about working with us"
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to exploit oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so far invested sums, even if not known in detail, show an increasing interest by observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about technology that is still in the early days because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For the time being, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are a small dimension and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
For greater energy production, however, technologies with a greater impact on the environment need to be used.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fear that are connected to each other.
The force of the waves that move the buoys up and down is changed using cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure's turning the turbine that's powering up the generator.
Energy's coming ashore with underwater cables.
For the time being, there are four facilities of this type at the project stage, waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could serve military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping mall and parking lot using six offshore turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the tide causes the rotation of the turbines, which feeds the generator with this rotating movement.
Verdant said they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
At this point, special interest deserves the potential of tide and tide, they say at the Institute for Electric Energy Research.
Although it is an incoherent factor, the tide and tide are more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in the energy of the tide of the countries such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states already invested $7 1/2 million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
