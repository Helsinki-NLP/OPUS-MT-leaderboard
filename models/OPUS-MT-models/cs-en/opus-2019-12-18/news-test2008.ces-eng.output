Inflation in Europe jumped over food
Accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
The November price growth in 13 euro area countries was above expectations, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent registered after 2.6 percent in October, announced by the Luxembourg Union Statistical Office.
The official forecast assumed only 3 percent, reported by Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British, and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate, with reductions resulting in inflation spirals along with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment.
The ECB would like to keep inflation rates below 2%, but close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "repel" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about this later.
In Germany, November inflation accounts for 3.3 percent of the 15-year record; in Spain it then rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has been thrown up due to rising food and energy prices.
Term prices of wheat have increased by 88 percent, and the soy exchange rate has reached the highest since 1973.
It was also necessary to pay significantly more in 2007 for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets has increased by 52 percent this year, and last month, one barrel of black gold has already cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent to 2.5 in 2008 but will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, 12-month inflation will remain approximately 3% over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double down interest rates during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz's circle of supporters has grown significantly since the prolonged stagnation in early December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while the Gallup Institute has never measured the 13 percent support in the case of socialists.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the voters of the opposition - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support compared to five-year support for MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entry into parliament: their support for the entire population is 2%.
Among certain voters of the party are supporters of both camps one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has also deteriorated due to the previous minimum - the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be strictly very bad has never been so high - 41 percent, while, according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about changing their material situation after spring and summer's brighter prospects.
As far as next year is concerned, a larger proportion of the population is counting on further deterioration and only one tenth of the improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the respondents judged, which is the most recent survey of the Gallup Institute, that the Prime Minister is doing his job wrong rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány believes or believes very much 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orbán's share of supporters is 38 percent.
The Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent at all, Chairman of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without changing the government.
While, after October's riots last year, the government and Prime Minister considered it desirable 35 percent, at present this share is only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the launch of the new elections.
For the interest in the referendum, it is significant that 60 percent of the respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that they would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 percent said that they would probably come.
To compare, the 'Municipal elections held this Sunday' would certainly be attended by only 55 percent, and another 15 percent would consider their participation to be probable.
The school would say no to 74, medical fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people promising their participation, then the introduction of tuition fees, medical fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, nearly a fifth more expensive Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs Commercial Triangle preserved last year's average 16 percent price level growth, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs business triangle increased by 16 percent on average this year, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase in the notation of over a thousand forints.
As food supermarket prices "flew" already last December, a percentage of the previous high base did not show such a drastic price increase.
However, it is certainly unhappy for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price below 9,000 forints will not be bought now even for 10,000.
The daily economy consumer basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of 10,000 forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, however, cruel breasts, nuts and poppy seeds were very expensive.
The prices of bread and flour were consistent with the Central Statistical Office's data, although in Auchan we found kilos of bread for 139 forints.
Competition didn't go with the product price below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the double-litre Coca Cola in the return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the backup cost the product only 257 forints.
This year, however, he appeared to be the most expensive according to the consumer basket of the newspaper Napi Gazdaság Auchan, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices in Napi Gazdaság's consumer basket increased by 15 last Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan increased by approximately 18 percent.
Compared to last year's highest and this year's lowest consumer basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
Forints had an average increase of 1,480.
The average price increase last year was 1,206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It is this process that has been disrupted by trade, obviously the commercial houses have not been able to decide how large price ranges are to be established for each product because they have not been able to predict what effect price changes will have on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product in question poorly, the price range adjusted to the intensity of the circulation may result in a significant loss of profit.)
Due to VAT, last year the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket was so extremely high that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest was the price difference of all 844 forints.
This year, the most expensive basket cost more than 1 630 forints last year and also the cheapest one cost 1 284 forints.
Compared to both Christmas seasons, price growth was catastrophic, and in less than 20 months, daily consumption in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, does not completely confirm the Central Statistical Office's data: it measured a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
Other than flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the daily economy consumer basket, this seems almost impossible, as the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed price growth at least above 10 percent due to the base and worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in stronger positions than egg suppliers, and a drastic price increase has also been achieved in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a commercial gold triangle do not complain, they still report on a good year.
In our experience, most customers in three visited stores are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-term food for pay.
On Wednesday morning, there were long queues in all three supermarkets at the register, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in the countryside the turnover is lower, several international chains complain to research firms that sales lag behind their plans, not only in the case of food but also durable consumer goods.
In many places it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due mainly to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hospital health conditions, overcrowding beds, overloading personnel does not help stop diseases, claims the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places it is also saved on disinfectants.
In the trauma department of St. John's Hospital, MSA infection was diagnosed recently.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who entered the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return with an MRSA infection and due to the bacteria found in his organism could not yet be performed one important surgery.
By 10 December this year, 1 094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant agents were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, reported by Karolina Böröczová, the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents were definitely registered in hospitals, others are not known.
Almost two-thirds (683) of the infection was caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant gold staphylococci.
A third of the people in the nose without causing disease carry the bacterium Staphylococcusurea (SA).
Infections caused by SA (e. g. cervical inflammation, tonsil inflammation, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive degree or inappropriate extent, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics will develop a bacteria that is very resistant to antibiotics and which spreads rapidly in non-compliant hospital conditions.
Especially if the immune system is temporarily or permanently malfunctioning in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight, or patients in years can cause serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the head doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
"The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the disease agent is not examined."
Resists Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, treat them with rubber gloves and masks, and we have the antibiotics needed to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether the infection is present in their MRSA, however, it is not always possible to avoid infection.
Sampling not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable for the prevention of the emergence and spread of multi-resistant agents of diseases, claims Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection is typically found in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should check and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
Microbiological sampling, however, is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
This also involves the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations.
The most cases are thus revealed when the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the primary of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for treating individual infections, disease reports.
Antibiotic therapy needs to be targeted, or microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not follow this in all cases.
Sampling of microbiological samples is even rarer in the basic or outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczová said.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most often through medical personnel.
That is why hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals as well.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
Rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröczová remarked, unfortunately we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals that are in an adverse material situation, they save on disinfectants, nurses are few and patients are a lot, thereby increasing the chances of developing infections.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are proven to be less likely or further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written an MRSA prevention programme or a reduction in its occurrence.
The programme appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a declining trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks among its priorities the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these disease agents.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert report in the case of police captain XXII district, which caused a fatal accident, is complete.
It can be excluded that police captain XXII of the district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, informed the spokesperson of the Attila Morvai District Attorney General on Friday after this case was completed.
The expert report confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which has already stated that the former police captain had no alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
At that time, the police director of the XXII district struck down his own passenger car on Tuesday at Lajos Kossuth Street in XXII district when turning a 55-year-old man who entered the road before him when crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian was crossing outside the zebra, according to road rules, is not a mitigating circumstance, the deflecting car must still give priority.)
After the transfer to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the District Police Director resigned from his post and requested to be retired, according to the police statement, because he was so shaken up by the case.
He's conducting an investigation into the Budapest State Attorney's Office of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with prosecutors conducting investigations since the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks worth EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed by Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously entered into a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the now signed contract covering the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also used for the budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with an extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which will be used primarily by the budget for the Debrecen University research and development project.
There was also talk about the 4th metro route at the meeting.
The Parties agree that, once Hungary has agreed on the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, it will return to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed EUR 8.4 billion in total of 113 projects in Hungary.
The interest on loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to a previously neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys the cheapest yet, but fast-priced EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria, with its cheap ski suites and houses on the seashore, is undoubtedly the most sought-after Eastern European real estate purchase goal.
From the mountains are the most in the course of the area Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient towns of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will be aroused sooner or later and more interested in the area of the cheap city of Ruse.
Sofia's capital is also a promise of tempting possibilities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, and thus beside the summer and winter season a sought after destination in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are thus already buying large, for example in the vicinity of Bansk.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, there are traditionally many Russian customers by the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
Foreign buyers climb into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth €50-100,000 or dilapidated old houses for €5-15,000, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important to them.
The second category is the buyers of chat (Bulgaria was ranked among the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors that purchase in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
The increase in real estate in the capital is continuous, as demand is getting stronger and stronger.
Although Bulgaria's lowest real estate prices are in the European Union, over the last five years, they have increased by 21 percent per year.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly above wage growth.
Fodor and Hungarian 6 percent
According to information from the Minister for the Environment and Water Management of Gábor Fodor, meetings of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and after Wednesday's official launch, the international conference on the climate regime will continue after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Travel Map, which deals with efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At this point, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not now wish to discuss precise figures, although they are inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020.
Another big issue of the conference is whether advanced countries, in addition to reducing emissions, will also go to providing both material and technological assistance to countries that are dependent on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member management board, probably under the World Environmental Protection Programme (GEF) at the UN - can be read in Piac és Profit magazine.
Hungarian 6 percent
Minister for the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in its efforts to promote global climate protection and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to a 30% reduction if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept the responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set out the target of a reduction of 5.2 percent, with 15 EU Member States committed to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the years 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our country. - it is mentioned in the Ministry of Environment's press release.
It is a big deal in Bali, because an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would not have shifted with certainty until 2012. In that case, the commitments to the reduction provided for by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow up with a new emission reduction system, the necessity of which, in its latest report, was also highlighted by the UN International Climate Change Scientific Council - the IPCC, which is the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and the inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British military units publish video-sharing on a video-sharing server footage from events in Iraq and Afghanistan that popularize themselves.
First, YouTube was popular with the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos from actions against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
The recordings, taken with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Headquarters in the Kandahar region and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
By this form, 139 recordings of British air force soldiers have already been made online, and more than 75,000 people have already looked at their "channel. "
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and released recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the Commonwealth Office) and international peacekeeping units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Air forces released videos according to their original purpose for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defence they are also good enough to familiarize the general public with the real aim of the military presence abroad.
"Promotion published in this form against traditional TV recruitment advertising costs almost nothing," said the BBC defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it also necessarily carries a political message, as it confirms in a special way the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made a game
The army is worried that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also being sent to the server, showing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a bit of hypocritical, "official" promotional films, the officers talk most about losses, but there is no bloody form of struggle.
After all, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been made online, but the British army hasn't discovered them until now.
Americans recruit a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can through a more or less faithful simulation get directly into the skin of soldiers.
There'll be Christmas at the ministries with raffles and spaghetti
The Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperthová is probably not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to her pagoas and coffee in 2007.
At some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere it will conjure the officials with a raffle and a toast.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - that's how powerful people have fun.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will hold the most expensive ministerial Christmas party this year, but it does not expect its employees.
At Christmas orphans will receive gifts from children of fallen soldiers, during Mission Christmas they will feast on family members of soldiers who are currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the hooves compared to other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints and of the six hundred employees of the Ministry approximately 300 guests are expected.
The resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and raffles will also be drawn.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
The hall rental cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than 400 invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: this will be organized by the tender company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented the building of the Vígszínház Theatre.
MAG a. s. has not confirmed this information since we have not been able to reach the relevant person.
There's no need for a suit
The CIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas held the ball of St. Lucia on December 7.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began with a greeting minister, after dinner it was possible to dance accompanied by live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball, evening dresses or suit were not required at all.
The Puritan Party is being prepared by resorts of health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
The Minister of Labour Moonika Lampert invites colleagues not even officially to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department's statement, will receive only coffee and spaghetti, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his co-workers will simply drink in the auditorium of the Ministry for Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting at which 436 employees are expected to attend, in their own large hall.
At the Christmas party he devotes 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a toast.
Since Minister János Veres, PM workers have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missed, the officiality increases not only the ministerial speech but also the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Resort hosts a new year's reception on January 20th, and ministerial Christmas is not happening.
The reception will take place in the castle Vajdahunyadvár in the Municipal Orchards and according to the Ministry's communication, 1 000 forints per person are designated for 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, where only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short greeting minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not host Christmas parties at all, told the portal [origo] the relevant press departments.
They couldn't tell the price of Christmas celebrations at the Department of the Environment in the Press.
In any case, 400 people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Decorative Arts.
Coming up on a giant strike
On Friday, the League Trade Union Association, or the National Labour Council Union (MOSZ), will set up its strike committee to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
On Saturday there will be a protest public assembly, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious disruption of transport, as railway transport will almost completely stop and the staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will be on strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League will introduce together with the National Association of Workers' Councils with details jointly organized on Monday's strike.
There will also be the LIGA - MOSZ strike committee, which will coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday there is a protest public assembly, from Monday the unions joining the strike stop work for an indefinite period unless there is an agreement with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not eventually adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the legislation is voted, the strike committee will meet and decide on further action.
According to the Monday agenda of the Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will not be voted on until late evenings or late nights.
Due to Monday's start-up strike it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: on the railway the work will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of the companies Volán can stop.
At the same time, half the road will be closed in many places in the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil organisations joined the call for strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations have announced a strike for an indefinite period, others have declared temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Railway Workers' Union (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, while more and more people travel by rail at the beginning of Christmas holidays.
According to previous communications, the BKV will strike from the beginning of operation until 13:00, from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organised by the LIGA Energy Workers' Union, to 2- and 2-8-hour work stop call for the Association of Teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers.
The Union of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Health Workers and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum (SZEF), organises a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the Government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that a new method of calculating pensions valid from next year be introduced gradually.
Third, to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the system for early retirement for the relevant fields of employment before 2010.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Railway Workers' Union (VDSZZZZ) under the Liga trade union does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railway branches and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Institute of Political Capital, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region in several respects.
The company's "risk warning" says: in the context of the Hungarian Guard's activities, the greatest political risk is that "a violent ethnic conflict may already occur in the short term" by focusing on the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Romani population of Hungary.
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to provoke such an action - it is supplied by the Research Institute.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "Public debate on the Roma issue was left to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict. "
This deepens the problem, hinders normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the Institute judges.
Moreover, according to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard's activity has "to a large extent ruined the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity."
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have become increasingly public since autumn 2006, is that several organizations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007, which are called "national militia" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they openly proclaim - even armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of natural disasters, domestic assault, disorderly conduct), plus with reference to the inability of the police, military, or state," he adds.
He also notes: all of this is being done in a way that tries to wrap up various political efforts based on the opposition of society to politics and parties to civilian robes.
Thus, emphasising civility and form of society in the case of these groups is not only to avoid legal difficulties of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard's activity is also a factor increasing the risk from the perspective of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, the ultranationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the emergence of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this can affect the political stability of the region," he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
As he writes, the Hungarian Guard's activity is similar, for example, to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the establishment of the Bulgarian Guard stands the mass Romani riots that broke out in one of Sofia's neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
She used that BNU to set up a guard, with the aim of the organization being "national militia."
In the past 17 years, according to her, "Gypsy terror" has occurred in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, reminds the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative has sparked a turbulent discussion with the Bulgarian public.
As he goes on to say, an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guards as a sign of resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard's activities so far show similarities to the Bulgarian National Guard's activities, it is not possible that Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own militia, we can read in the risk alert drawn up by the Institute of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Institute of Political Capital, told the press office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year, and if they find anything that might affect the risk change, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays aren't available everywhere
In Hungary, the days off are precisely laid down by law, and it has become a general practice that workdays are moving around the holidays, which is less likely to happen next year.
In the European Union and America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and national holidays and working quiet days.
The days of work rest are usually tied to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate New Year's: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a work day - for New Year's already so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
In the course of the year we have eleven free holidays in total.
The national holiday is March 15 celebrating the revolution from 1848 and October 23rd, the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1 work, on November 1 and 2 remember our dead relatives and friends.
Besides, it's Easter, Pentecost and Christmas with us for two days.
Since our national, national or religious holidays are rarely on weekends according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move a working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends is, of course, that we stay in the workplace and in school before Saturdays.
We have been working on the day immediately preceding or following the festival, for many years the Minister of Labour has been adjusting in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not concern companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or, in view of their designation, also operate on working days.
This year, there will be a change in the order of employment only around the end of the year: life in the country will almost stop as from 24 December, because according to the experience of most people, the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve will "work" in advance or use the saved holiday.
In the next year we will have several holidays in the middle, or at the end of the week, so the shift of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be transformed around the day of work so that the workers can stay home for four days in time.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that Friday 2 May can be a day of rest.
The next move is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will work instead of Friday 24.
However, the end of the year next year will be completely marked by holidays, because from 24 December they will have almost all the nonstop holidays even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six scaring little things you can piss off your colleagues with
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we will almost never notice: all this "strengthens" weekdays at the workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these minor inconveniences, or you put on gloves and unclear situations that others can anger, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
That you missed a meeting about it?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to deliver the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, there's one apology that's solved.
Before awkward apologies occur, it is good to think about what you could do to prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more awkward than reaching out for some document, office supplies or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk yesterday, but he's gone by morning?
Or did you find a pen on one of your colleagues' desks that you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will rightly be angry with you for going through their things.
Do not remove envelopes or adhesives from your office because it may be uncomfortable if you run out of paper early and you need them immediately.
Rumors about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop spreading rumors.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don't put your private life messages on everyone's nose!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not take advantage of his trust!
Lock what you have heard and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his affairs.
You report your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and appeal to a severe headache you report your absence because you are not well or think that today you would rather rest, think that your work, urgent tasks and work, which have a certain deadline, will have to be done by someone else.
Have regard for your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen to make you have to stay home, please report that your colleagues and managers are not confronted with your absence until the second day.
Grunts, giggles, phone calls
Have you been plunged into a job that's gonna rip you off with a giggling coworker?
Did you unwittingly witness a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear?
Do not disturb your coworkers by humming, chanting, loud talk (over their heads), or by stomping, constant cursing, loud discontent.
All of this can be disruptive even when they are not involved in a project (written, planning, organization).
Are you accusing others of making mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not appeal to any chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and correct the damage!
Ask how you can fix things, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in your office?
Tracksuits and slippers: comfortable at home, but not suitable for office!
Don't wear your leisure clothes even if your profession allows you to!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in a regular dress - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When you want to suit, you stop being interesting.
Running around in the usual morning traffic.
There will be a special tune from the radio: the sound of violins connected to electronic effects.
Adding volume.
Music changes pace and the previous tone coloring adds bass, then as a real jewel joins the female choir.
At the station mr2 is the composition of the band Zagar called Wings of Love.
Home music life hasn't spoiled us for a long time with high-quality electronic pop.
But suddenly the traffic looks quite different because you're listening to the new Zagar album.
The apparition of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions originating from the home digital underground, slowly changes the overall image, and although it is again in the fashion of garage rock with its beating into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zsager started out in Five-Stels, and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until finally - perhaps because two pipers couldn't fit into one line - he went his own way.
But with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he started to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film by Ferenc Töröka "Szezon").
His formation, playing in the beginnings of smaller clubs, was recognized by a wider audience after the Wan2 magazine included their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important home albums and declared Zagar as the only domestic entities determining developments that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "at odds," although of course no one asked them if they are satisfied with this label.
The band responded as it should: she made a new, better album.
Now released an album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open up new paths to them, although the name itself tries to create continuity with the initial flights in the Five-Carts.
This is one verse from the composition of the old band Balázs Zsager.
A reference to the ethereal, flying would be appropriate, but next to the ethereal breath of this music appeared now - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, presented himself at the premiere of the Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Petőfi station, which has recently played popular music from morning to evening, we started to enjoy the whimsical tunes of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay.
The Hvg.hu portal interviewed Balázs Zsager.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how much does what you play remain marginal music?
Balázs Zsager: Definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only be created because of sales, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can come from an honest inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude of how it is adopted works, independently of the language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of a Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are concerts not only for teenagers and people in their 20s, but also for older ones.
They see much more the transformations of light music happening around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and in how large a number of your music listens?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived rather in concerts where mutual influence already works, but it is only hidden in inexhaustible transformations of the moment.
Still, I noticed that when you want to suit an audience, from that moment on, you stop being interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo and built his career more from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music.
We are more of a team player who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, we could not avoid our work comparing ourselves to the compositions of Yonderboi, for a few of us separated from his band and went another way.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the station mr2 Petőfi the song Wings of Love got first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this piece.
More popular style, did you consciously open yourself up to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We didn't plan on writing a hit to sell a record.
There's more to this song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea to assemble this choir from the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
That's how this six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judi Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - got together, which we then baptized at Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls transform something into it?
B.Zs.: The composition had long existed in the instrumental version, when the material on the record was gathered, we thought there was something else needed for this song.
The sequence of chords seduced to join him in the singing part.
That night, I sang a melody to him that the girls later learned.
It all worked out almost the first time and so spontaneously.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course it needed wonders.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and on the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing together and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They also stood on the stage in the back.
On purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we did not want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where it belongs, where it belongs, and just letting the wings, the wings of love rise.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music actually not with one, heavier pieces occurred rather during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work groove, then everything slowly found its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which piece from the new record is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This keeps changing with concerts, even by releasing the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A traitor's broker risked billions of inferiority
A traitorous embezzler.
Thus denotes his former employee Jerome Kerviel's French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka.
She lost almost five billion euros because of him.
More likely, Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big bank houses, he recognized the US mortgage market crisis in time.
"He is mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent the police after him.
But, as Kerviel's testimony shows, which French media, such as Le Monde, provided, was a man who had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February news began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis was not supposed to affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit was up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I made my first half a billion dollars, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything for himself.
In the whole interrogation, he admits he faked the records so it wouldn't be found.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange became interested in his business.
The risk was profit.
Was he worried he'd find out?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to work his way into his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from Lyon University.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being looked at.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he made half a billion euros in the bombings on London.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But they said the bosses knew everything, or rather suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the wound at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days for the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can obtain €14 billion in the coming years (approximately CZK 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will be directed to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Firms should raise funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, as well as for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the newly adopted countries in drawing money from EU funds so far.
20-year sentence for ex-President Nicaragua confirmed by the court
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year sentence for the former president of Arnold Aleman, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud reaching $100 million (almost CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicarague metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002, goes back to prison, the AP agency says it's not clear at the moment.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on prison officials whether they will let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictional, and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in the fund that Aleman founded to finance his campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He passed last year with ČSSD support because Minister Sobotka prepared him and ČSSD could not afford not to accept him.
Unlike a busy debate before the vote on government distrust, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies traditionally ignored, although the most influential, the law approved in peace.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of the government with the opposition.
This is more media-thankful, and that is why he pays much more attention to him in the media.
Politicians' guessing is far more interesting to the public than the sharp numbers.
State budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered from three infirmities, which the 2008 one is unable to resolve at once:
The first is a high share of the law of mandatory, so-called mandatory expenditure, which is not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalice" ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first infirmity.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. deficit of budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the deficit of the state budget.
It's public and relatively controlled.
However, the time bomb is the deficit of budgets for cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to the tax, tax, and credit money from banks, gain additional resources for investment, often headlessly issuing bonds by which they disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts by selling the shares of energy and other distribution networks that they have received from the state in privatisations.
Now they don't have this source anymore.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through the growth phase for several years, as has the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to fix public finances.
Instead, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more reasonably than our Republic.
It is a huge embarrassment that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, the least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, in recent years have quite unnecessarily swelled into gigantic proportions.
Even if some of the senseless populist spending, approved before the elections this year, has been abolished, so if there is no retirement and pension reform threshold in the near future, then any policy in this country will actually end and whoever rules will be a mere office.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed pension money and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the suppression of normal expenditures by mentors.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments had not managed to do what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want to see ruling politicians become mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not-so-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only those will allow a balanced state budget to be achieved gradually.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together to combat the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank is borrowing an interest rate at which it is willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, and another $24 will make it available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time the national central banks have agreed to such coordinated action to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis after the attacks of September 11th.
"This step is intended to address the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," said Bernard Bau's client report from Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumoj said in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion over outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
"Central banks must be really worried about what else might happen when they decided to do this," said the chief economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"The situation seems to be really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend their customers a loan.
This would reduce consumption and send America's economy into recession with possible effects on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual lending of money, even though US, Canada, and Britain central banks reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank's move will contribute to averting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and this is the fall in the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: The debate of environmentalists is incredible
Global climate change is supposed to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now come to an end at the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he said that environmentalist debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which is made up of a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric behind it and reality.
"Debata there is completely unstructured, it is just a firework of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President emphasized that his topic is very important to him, and therefore he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "many times I encounter only caricatures of my opinions."
So now interested ones can read his unmistakable attitudes.
Klaus reminded us that although he is not a climate scientist, he believes that he has enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional papers, has experience with statistics, and is also an economic operator.
The main conclusions of the book are that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent view of the warming of the planet by all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not very large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable protection of the environment but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits. "
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver's license didn't change 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not have time to change their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue them a new ID by the end of the year.
But the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would take the road after the New Year without valid authorization.
According to the authorities, it wasn't just those who didn't want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of a license, the authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed by requests and the interest in the exchange of a licence has increased this week.
The Magistrate stores around 2000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the queues.
In Prague, approximately 140,000 drivers still did not change their driver's license.
It takes 20 days to issue a new ID.
However, it may be requested to issue within a reduced period of five days.
In that case, however, the driver will pay CZK 500.
Motorists who fail to change their licence by the end of the year and leave the road without a valid driver's licence will be fined from January.
The perpetrator will pay a maximum of CZK 2,000.
But a policeman can deal with a misdemeanor with an agreement.
In the case of administrative offense, the fine will climb to CZK 2500.
According to previous information, he could have been fined by the town hall and the person who wasn't going anywhere.
It was said that 30,000 crowns could be paid.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and to impose a maximum of a thousand grand a fine.
According to the spokesperson of the Department of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, but no one is in danger of tens of thousands of fines.
According to him, the driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not an ID that every person has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driving license.
Just carry it or send it by registered post to the competent municipal authority.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to trade.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million other documents.
The court has reduced the sentences of the detectives associated with Berdych.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal conspiracy with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
The Prague Supreme Court decided to do so definitively, which reduced their sentences by one year and another by two years.
Originally threatened detectives of the Prague Department of Fighting Organized Crime 14 and 12 years.
You can no longer appeal against today's decision; only a summons to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he's only waiting for a first-instance verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already been punished in the sum of over 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court acknowledged, in particular, the participation in the robbery of 19 people, the Supreme Court today handling the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have refused since the beginning of the investigation with the fact that it is a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemia Senate, police members, in agreement with Berdych, were handing over information from police sources to criminals, covering up individual robberies, and helping gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent for the dandruff for Opava and Cognac.
The prosecution is a gang felony from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious injury to their health, but also abuse of the authority of a public official and illegal arming.
Police discovered illegally held guns, bullets with a steel core, laser sighting or machine gun during house searches.
According to the charges, the gang's made tens of millions of crowns in robberies.
In addition to nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have finally acknowledged the guilty of other robberies of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men around Berdych are still confessing in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to trial.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půto and Maroš Šulej, who are staying in Irish custody, waiting for a definitive decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child Interchange Account: 12 million
Igor Veleba's lawyer wants CZK 12 million in compensation for the substitution of children in the maternity ward, plus court expenses.
For each mother of three million, for the father of two million and for the children of one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ondřej Dostál's attorney does not agree with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," said Dostál after today's meeting.
"However, in order to have an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty had drawn up.
Let's see if it's worth anything.
However, we remain in the view that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál emphasized.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablona family wanted a million crowns for every month when they didn't raise their biological daughter.
He served Veleb as a basis for negotiating compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motol.
Children's parents, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress at different levels and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even when faced with remorse that they did not prevent the replacement of newborns.
Once again, women are harder to cope with the topicality of the traumatic experience, and with what is happening right now, he summarized the contents of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třibíč hospital last December 9.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Cermákův do Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
Hejtman Vysočina Miloš Vysistil handed over CZK 100,000 to each of the families at the end of October to compensate for the expenses incurred by them by the mistake of the Třibíč hospital, which the Region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In the event of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request assistance from the founder.
The courts have so far granted people relatively low compensation, the sums were calculated according to tables in hundreds of thousands of crowns, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup has lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Soup lost the dispute over the Valachian Kingdom brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, although the King of Wallachia used the designation for the first time, the project was built by a long-term work team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
Soup didn't attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client will appeal.
"The point is that Mr Harabiš and his team are parasitic in the popularity of Bolek Polivka," said the lawyer after the Soupk trial.
According to him, everyone in the kingdom of Wallachia remembers the actors and comics.
Harabish thinks the same way.
"We have almost a decade's work behind us.
Getting money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could get something out of it.
They want to parasite on our work," he added.
Lukrative business
According to the court, the king of Wallachia used soup for the first time on his TV show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzezobohatý.
At the time, however, this was not related to the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionist event turned out to be a business and lucrative business activity, followed by Harabiš's establishment of the Valachian Kingdom.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to mention his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš merely took advantage of the bare idea that Polívka published in the business for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Políva of the Valachian Kingdom project certainly helped," said the judge.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who devoted himself intensively to him.
The cooperation of today's devastated parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vsetín for Soup.
Since then, however, disputes between Soup and Harabiš began to accumulate, which culminated in the overthrow of the "king of Boleslav I. elected forever."
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken up by singer Jarmila Šuláková as queen mother at the instigation of Harabish.
In 2002 Soup then filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which was dismissed by the court today.
Clearness could bring Harabish to the upcoming contest for the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to reveal the details and the deadline yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like riding kings on a Slovak.
The King should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr.Polívka can register," said Harabiš.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Vanishing Prejudice
In fact, I've never really been a fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of gearing, steering, and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But there is now a Peugeot 207 successor on the market, and it is much better.
And a wagon called SW goes a little further, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the head space in the backseat.
That's the end of the complaint here, because the station wagon means that even two-foot-longs won't suffer in this direction.
♪ On a world flight ♪
I'm gonna go over the interior really fast so I don't repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty good design where my only complaint is to the poor middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design invention here, since the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side lines have also improved significantly against model 206.
What about the space, so also here can feel an increase in the size of the body.
In the estate then disappears already mentioned lack of space above the head.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing about this car is his luggage man.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (even thanks to the tilting back window) and as politely stocked.
Deaf places are equipped with rubbers that are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't interfere, it can be spread and it can hold even heavier objects.
But let's stop at the volume together.
This is according to the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is against the competition rather the average value.
Not against the most sold car of this class in the Czech Republic - Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of young Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot lags a lot behind 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the floor completely flat after the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre spark-ignition four-cylinder with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's what a 16-year-old girl should look like who drives a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it has little consumption and, above all, it pulls.
If I compare it to a damage-making analogy that sometimes acts as if it had a rag stuffed into the exhaust, then I can only be thrilled with it.
Price list hints
The price of a car isn't folk.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a sparkling 14th grader for 329 900 CZK is still OK.
Our aggregate costs CZK 410 900, which is quite enough.
The tested premium equipment then throws in the equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper launch, electric rear window control...
The car costs 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the extra gear at Fabia's and you'll get a lot of similar numbers.
So all we have to do is decide on the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
There are growing children from Eastern European countries in British schools, which raises concerns for local residents about the further development of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans so far faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the indigenous population grow violently.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe at British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Argument, bullying, and fighting among the students have also taken place in the relationship between the parents.
The situation has gone so far that in Chatham, police have arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten - year - old student with an iron rod.
The guilty one resists the fact that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on Slovak immigrants.
The girls of the man allegedly shared racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he turned on us with apples and pears, and then he revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even called the dispute with Eastern European immigrants a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
In Britain, 70,000 Slovaks are registered to work here.
Roughly 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island of the Caribbean
It really is an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can come true if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters, offering pizza on the beach, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
But only on one island you will find much more, and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
Behind the Spaniards, Cuba used to be the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure transfer point that the Spanish in America had stolen and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 1920s.
He was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially during prohibition) was welcome and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew up, and on the broad boulevards there were cars that belonged to the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a mansion in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, both show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar of the dear hotel Nacional, they'll make you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And the iconic cars from the 1950s are still driving around Havana because once imported jigguls and fiats in that salty and humid air have long since rotted.
Even if Havana, especially the oldest part of Havana, is quite dilapidated, yet nowhere around is there as many beautiful colonial monuments as right there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
As tourism brings so much money, its development has a green light.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguin and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another favourite, which is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by trainers.
The cane from the vast plantations was picked up into sugar factories on narrow tracks by steam trains and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, so there are functional machines, whose peers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors in Cuba will not miss.
And so about Varader or Havana, there's no need to write down too much.
Perhaps just to remind you that in Hemingway's already mentioned settlement there is a museum and who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
Vinales Valley One of the most picturesque parts of Cuba is the valley of Vinales in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone base.
The mogots, limestone homos, and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and in their cavities the fertile soil is caught, which also makes the windy rocks covered with dense growth.
The valley is where the finest Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be met if you visit one of the Havana fabriks to make cigars.
Some might find it interesting that there was a Chilean episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was established not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought him a trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth has been transformed into the beauty and display of the small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road connecting that region to the rest of the country.
She helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing happened, everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time for Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth looking at places of interest in the nearby area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or Sugar Valley.
In the evening it is time to go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it quiets over the morning.
Baracoa
A small town in the very east of Cuba is referred to as the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion certainly affects the journey itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánamo must overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through nature, which human activity almost did not notice.
The eastern outpost of Cuba was registered by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact they originated about a hundred years after Columbus' cruise) and down the hill where the former castle and today's El Castillo hotel are located, there are several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigarillos, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isle of Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, the Santheria of the Cuban patronage of Caridad del Cobre, the Santheria, the African religions that confess the descendants of former slaves, many pages could be described.
But, as they say, better to see once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, tough Americans
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment influence the mission in Afghanistan according to the United States.
NATO, according to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not go as planned, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are discussing other plans and coordination of allies today.
While the United States, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called on NATO troops to do more activity this week, Great Britain sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to enable the residents to start further economic and security development themselves," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC station.
Ninety per cent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to US military figures, the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent events increased by 27 percent compared to last year, even by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have roughly 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, roughly a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the limit of organization and equipment of troops.
Specifically, they're asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific objectives for the next time and the ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has also spoken today.
"I am not pleased with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that is not enough," Reuters De Hoop told Reuters De Hoop at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
There have also been disputes among the participating countries in recent months about whether allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan thugs have been exposed: the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," wrote Sun in the material supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went into counterattack and printed a picture of the British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will go up to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a state debt of over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better development of state budget management.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the state debt at the beginning of October today.
Each Czech owes more than 84,000 crowns.
Over the entire last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that due to a lower deficit for next year, we could not cross the limit of CZK trillion until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between CZK 900 billion and CZK trillion," the analyst Patria Finance David Marek told news server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, analyst Next Finance Vladimír Pikora sees this: "We could get to exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could shift to 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts Are Growing
The government's debt is made up of central government debts and is mainly generated by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
State debt is financed by treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or loans from the European Investment Bank, for example.
So far, the state's internal debt has risen by CZK 38.5 billion to CZK 711.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion this year.
The so-called marketable state debt amounted to CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and fell by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the state debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent year on year for the first to third quarter, which is indeed a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in bonds, where there is an increase of 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it will be doing business when pension reform is here," Pikora commented.
Better Than Expected
The 2007 financing and debt management strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better development of state budget management.
The amount is mainly the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, these are the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, the ten-billion-dollar reserve for pension payments, the financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to come to the Khartoum court today for giving her name to a Teddy Bear
A British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday night to 15 days in prison and expelled, as stated by her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of having six to seven-year-old pupils give a stuffed bear the name Muhammad despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet Islam is forbidden.
She's been punished by a whip.
This UK 44-year-old teacher, working at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested in her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils lodged a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"From the mouth of the children, eight names will be spoken, including Hasan, Abdulah and Mohamed," says the school principal Robert Boulos.
After the vote takes place in the class, 20 out of 23 children eventually choose Muhammad as the most popular name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a teddy bear accompanied by a caption: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with that name on it, but the trouble is in the depiction of a prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One Muslim fellow Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I only regret asking children to vote for a name," according to him, it is only "innocent error."
This is the view shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils " and add that" they never talk about religion in class ".
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most commonly given first name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way to honor the prophet (often it is given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended their sixth and final round of talks on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement," declared European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Prištin to heed their commitments to keep the peace and to be prepared for dialogue even after the negotiations were over.
"We do not expect violence anytime soon, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, "it is evident that the situation is tense."
The negotiations shall end on 10 December.
Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent make up the Albanian-speaking population, could turn out in a clearer light as of December 10th, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
Conversations in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, commissioned the Troika to negotiate again.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on 10 December.
On the other hand, Russians who previously blocked Kosovo's independence from the UN Security Council insist that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains in favour of a solution negotiated, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Charchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance by the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Priština declares that if the Security Council does not decide in favour of it, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," announced the President of the Kosovo Authority Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden hotel, where this "last chance meeting" took place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former insurgent commander of Kosovo's Albanians and future provincial prime minister, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past that led to murders and deportations. "
"Domino effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise is still being taken into account and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of any unilateral independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"However, this does not mean anything to Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be taken exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"The only solution acceptable to Serbia is the solution arising from the Security Council," declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"These negotiations lasted for two years.
It must end as it began: on the Homeland Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word on status will have a Kosovo parliament" and added that if there had been a unilateral declaration of independence from Albanian-speaking residents, there would have been "a deal" with the West.
Bush made a deal with the Israelis and Palestinians.
At the launch of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened from its instigation, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate opening of negotiations with the intention, once and for all, to resolve the 60-year dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything possible to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, declared Bush and recalled the obligations that flow from the "travel map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House Chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim "to conclude a peace treaty that would solve all pending issues without exception, including central issues'.
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees exiled in the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US President and emphasized that the subsequent negotiations should be "total and thorough" and to touch on all aspects of the solution, with the mention "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things".
Then Olmert appeared on the bleachers, who expressed the opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "suspected to be concluded during 2008."
Bush identified the end of 2008 as the date for the implementation of his "vision of two states," the Palestinian and Israeli, existing alongside each other.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had accepted a commitment from Bush in this sense before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries offering peace to Israel in exchange for abandoning all Arab territories taken during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saudi in an interview, which he gave to an Arab-speaking newspaper shielded by Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., the cops are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with these little black chronicle messages, the official versions do not match what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the survey of the General Inspection of the French State Police (IGPN), a police car passed through Louise-Michel on Sunday shortly after 17 o'clock in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but it was on patrol and passed at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, while the side lights were not switched on" explains the police source.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore without permission to drive on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without helmets, passed through "very high speed."
"Motorcycle crashed from the left side into a police car after he didn't prefer from the right" stated one policeman.
The blood alcohol promile test performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (protruded front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the sharpness of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérése de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGPN was responsible for investigating "the actions of unintentional killing and failure to provide assistance to people at risk," which is also adopted by directing départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Directorate of Regional Police Department Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by the IGPN precludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
According to the clerk, three witnesses of the accident who were interviewed on Sunday night confirmed "the variation of policemen, namely, that the minibike approached them quite quickly from the left. "
A striation, no doubt caused by the friction of the clipsen on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will pass the technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on both victims' bodies yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a rapid spread of rumors among people that police officers should have left the scene quickly without providing two young men with first aid.
IGPN was also to rule out "any serious error" at this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which to be very careful" said the police source.
The journal "Libération" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads right to where the accident took place.
"Instantly, my cousin and I, who is a nurse in the hospital, ran down to try to resurrect them," says this Witness.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw "a limping, completely terrified policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the youths and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and the certainty that the situation of young men is hopeless, the police were driven by a car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the departure of the police officers."
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Don't let anyone say that the police authorities didn't rush the youngsters to help.
First aid was given to these youths.
Fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor emphasized.
Tensions Growing in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstration since the announcement of an emergency by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the town of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under an exceptional condition were injured by tear gas grenades that, according to witnesses, were used by law enforcement.
The last ones responded with rocks, hurting several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been subpoenaed.
Similar scripts as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded lawyers.
Several were to be subpoenaed.
In Islamabad, the attorneys of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked by roadblocks on Monday morning in order to prevent a meeting.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (North-West).
On Monday, the Lawyer Movement received the support of religious parties grouped together in the politically strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "advised the population to send flowers to judges who opposed an exceptional condition, and trash to those who took an oath before Musharraf".
"Musharraf's promise does not apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in an indirect presidential election that took place on 6 October.
The President of Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness is unlawful, unconstitutional, and against Supreme Court judgments," declared the official in The News.
The promise of Parvíz Musharraf to give up the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the introduction of an exceptional condition, on Monday, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem declared.
He was expected to give up his military uniform until November 15th, when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Otherwise, the Pakistani government also disproved the country's ongoing speculation that the military chief's deputy should have ordered President Musharraf to be grounded.
More than a third of pregnancy still makes pregnancy unexpected
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly occurring.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected today, reveals a study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined) - State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly occurring.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the degree of failure, estimates Ined.
After all, the law of contraception enabled better "fertility control," claims the Institute and notes that the rate of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age was from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births are well planned today.
One pair of five has even calculated for the month exactly and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of the child.
A Remarkable Space Station Repair
More than seven hours of work in space needed an astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the torn solar panel necessary for further scientific activities of the station.
It was a risky exit into space, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from housing modules, speed at which it was planned and the rate of "cutivity" spent by astronauts to repair.
Trouble appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for modules-labor.
These, however, need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17-and-a-half-ton module producing electricity using solar panels already located on the ISS to anchor at its final site.
After it was moved, the crew began to decompose the 70-metre solar panels of the module.
And in that, one of the panels, decomposing as a drawer harmonica, due to a cable sprain, was damaged on an area nearly one meter wide.
The breakdown was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to perform a control output on the Discovery ship, and then go to repair another solar panel, whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the station's arm, and repaired it.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walker) of the American Aviation and Space Authority (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very handy, has very well-designed breasts and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this original profession was commissioned by a doctor to "operation" the "polared" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed some sort of "drains" to the damaged sites.
He was helped by the second "spacewalker" who remained close to the balancing chamber, and also from the inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, commander of the crew.
The tools he used, that is, a mini-hockey stick surrounded by an insulating device to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and "built" made by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely disassembled and then he inventoried his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day's rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are clearly losing on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company operating in the aviation and defence industries announced that it will have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
EADS lost 4% and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to reconsider its projected production results for 2007 as a result of delays resulting from slow progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the initial flight.
The cost of reducing delays in the delivery of a military freight aircraft, announced in October, was calculated "to EUR 1,2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus" announced the parent undertaking of European EADS designer.
Due to these costs, the EADS, next Thursday, will be forced to report a new profit outlook before interest and tax deduction (EBIT) when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Let us recall that EADS production results fell 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army would be provided in October 2009.
Status quo Decision
Sunday's elections will take place without any suspense: the Russians will mostly elect President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming that, after the end of a very few free election campaigns, their drive for stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will inform voters on public service stations of a pre-recorded television message whose content is kept secret.
It is doing so from the position of leader of the United Russia, the pro-Cremel Party, which appears to celebrate a crushing victory.
When he received ambassadors from foreign states yesterday, the president didn't let anything come out of him and settled for another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, and we want the fairest, as transparent and as open as possible, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
The Communist leader Gennady Zjuganov says that "never such a dirty election took place, not even for Yeltsin."
After the repression accompanying demonstrations from last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, according to her attorney, she continues to be banned from visiting.
"The Russians are left with homo sovietica mentality"
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple, tense expectations, two more open questions are profiled:
- "Who will become Putin's successor in the presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates may present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
But no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful Party of United Russia, who will choose the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire line in the parliamentary elections, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's tradition.
"The Russians are left with the mentality of homo sovietica, they don't feel like lords of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Sankt-Peterburg notes the more distant contexts: civil society has gained, in this country Christianized five centuries after Europe, delays; the famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so, that this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by some economic prosperity," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "voluntarily give up their personal responsibility " which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What's to think about?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Čerdeničenko, a 44 - year - old professor: "Why think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, depicting the fates of 17.5 million Hitler's victims, open to the public.
47 million archive documents stored 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes until this time, namely individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
Eleven states responsible for managing archives - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the ratification process of this agreement is over by all states, the opening of the agreement took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow "especially the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the medical condition of forced workers" to be examined, explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, have been opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
What are supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
Registers of concentration camps or arrests assembled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced work subjected to civilian citizens, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism Study Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Treaty in 2008, the European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India is now nearly 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the ninth trading partner of the EU.
"Free Trade Agreement is a huge druggie to both economies," and "India will gain better market access to 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, explained the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giant will exchange together "EUR 47 billion in goods" and "EUR 10 billion in services" this week, declared Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its full potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The English bank took note of its concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank of England indicated that it intended to alleviate current concerns that the conditions on the credit market would deteriorate again and announced the bid of £10 billion in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75%, an offer valid unusually long.
"In an effort to ease the concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and give banks greater confidence in the way in which to secure its cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," the Bank announced in a communiqué.
The bank states that £10 billion (€14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until 10 January at the basic interest rate.
This seems to be the first time that BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally, it takes a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "it remains ready to take further measures to maintain interest rates on a daily basis' of inter-bank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The inter-day interbank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled to 6.6%, which is the highest number since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market have been the Bank of England linked to the fee rates that deter banks from using this offer.
According to some speculations reinforced by the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many chose the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for People's Movements) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Wednesday) refuse to address the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the various paragraphs of the Socialist Bill on Acquisition on Thursday, which is equivalent to rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the bill came under the so-called socialist "nest" (meeting initiated by the individual club) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the Presidency of the PS, among which the employment premium was increased by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPPs, transport cheques or rent regulation.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the various paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television appearance on purchasing capacity.
The head of PS Members Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will re-submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act, which will be discussed by the House next week.
A New Festival Is Born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in cooperation with the Festival of the Republic of the British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a man who inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," said Charlie Jones from C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm with an area of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, the Republic Festival was founded by the Henham Park Festival in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also responsible for production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" that he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna are working simultaneously to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to establish a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We dealt with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, because of the current town leadership, we got caught up in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Luckily, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benne, and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
In 2005, the C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after they stood out at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to 9.8M$ and 11.3M$.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benna festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in green towns" says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a way so that we create both the impression of the rural festival in Europe and the urban one in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The village of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed person refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but claims that "they are advantageous enough to allow them to invest in such an event and to welcome the festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to that of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will accommodate 80,000 people.
It says that invitations have already been sent out to groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the programme is being put into print.
"Vineland will have a rocky touch, but the music will be varied to attract a wide range of spectators," says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promoter Award in the last Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically challenging" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, condemns "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fall into the "Governor" claws?
"Be careful, it's the industry who decides where to go.
If he finds out the conditions in Montreal are favourable, he'll go.
Our job is to offer those that they will consider the best," he said.
Festival hunting
For now, however, Denise Turcottea's priority is to promote the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether they are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting Quebec films, alerting them and ensuring that directors give interviews.
The Age of Darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January it will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is offered in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a marathon on the stock market at the end of the year? Experts divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors are already expecting me to have a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure it will happen.
Bank Banif considers that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive trend on the stock exchange'.
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, certain doubts'.
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange is moving in recent weeks and say that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income affected by the effect of turnover on quality securities, both in long and short sections'.
Therefore, they believe that the exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "especially because the likely fall in FED rates (the Federal Reserve), given the high level of oil prices and the dangers of incentives to inflationary pressures, is unknown'.
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to make bold statements that there will be a marathon.
"There's not a lot of reason to be happy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15 945,7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional deposits on supplementary pension insurance, which take place every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different because he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst for Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "that is why we could observe the reflection of the index caused by reports from the US on the consequences of the credit market crisis. "
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of titles that will ensure that they bring Ibex to the new maximum points.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is the time for strong titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive"
On the other hand, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it occurs.
"ACS has been recapturing positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will follow the same path" explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be at the forefront of the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology will also do very well, even if it is not represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of slumps in two cases.
The real marathon took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28,17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We will still see if 2007 will be the fifth year of profit (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36%) since January and will succeed in having its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
As well as for other Spanish entities, since it is the first group to make such a leap and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, which also assured several times that it wanted to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
Meanwhile, he intends to conclude an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of his branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience will be crucial for other entities to join this initiative, which supports business opening hours, or not.
This is precisely the objective of the project set out by Popular banka.
Get individual clients who go to these locations for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, since it is not about opening new branches but only about adjusting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize branches that it already has in business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients on individual streets.
The extension of opening hours is accompanied by another concept of the branch space and new, more recent design in brighter colours.
Ángel Rivera's business director assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it is transferred from six employees to a branch of between eight and nine.
Branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected on the streets of Madrid, Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a lucky choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
Another 60 immigrants specialized in Mundocredit also have a very long opening hours and even open on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, when many of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', says Rivera.
They just made a deal with Telefonica to sell cell phones through external personnel.
Telecinco has doubled the value of her rival Anteny 3 for the first time on the stock market
We did it.
In that sentence, Paolo Vasile, Executive Chairman Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of business when he stated that the television he was driving had doubled the value of his rival, Anteny 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I regret is that it did not happen because we increased more, but because we had fallen less', he said.
And yet he emphasized that because of the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco stopped trading yesterday by 2.54%.
This profit shifted their losses over the past period of the year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with Vocent's participation (another 13%) is EUR 4,488,88 million.
Its competitor, Antena 3, which dropped by 1,52% yesterday and decreased by 40,5% since January overall, is half the value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies rated is 3,571 billion for Sogecable, 2,518,53 million for Prisa (Prina Publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 offers because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in the ratings'.
Last week Telecinco announced that this year, by overcoming billions of gross advertising revenues, it would become the first television channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, Executive Chairman Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that provides advertising for the group.
If the forecast data were actually achieved, this TV channel would have recorded an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, Anteny's net turnover increased by 1.6% (and thus reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors the analysts are focusing on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay-out that she has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after buying 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of Telecinco's profits, namely in 2008 4% and in 2009 7%.
This is due to the fact that they explained that the expected revenue growth stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Anteny 3, 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
3 Opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: Recommends to purchase both titles mainly on the basis of increased dividend income and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco (mass) better than Antenu 3 (maintain) due to its 'number of advantages' and the growth of trade.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not to overestimate them as they face 'similar threats' (overcrowded market and impaired economic environment).
Congress approved the MiFID transfer valid from 1 November
At the same time as the parliamentary negotiations which were concluded today by the vote of Congress on amendments incorporated by the Senate in the bill, the government submitted a public hearing to the regulation that develops the new law in order for both of them to enter into force before the end of the year.
The parties' representatives have highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities needed for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial advice services to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services company (ESIS), financial consultancy company (AFI), which is connected to securities companies, securities brokers and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments is increased by connecting multilateral trading and internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets which will compete with current stockbrokers.
Furthermore, the law obliges investment services firms to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure, and risk management processes on the market, and requires a statement of all operations performed to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the consultation in the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were made to ensure that securitised claims were considered to be a "complicated' financial instrument in view of the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the USA with high risk mortgage debts (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the directive was used to establish legal functions that may be held by Bachelors in the field of economics and corporate governance 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require authorisation from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and customer acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat and Central European Bank (CEB)'s policy of providing data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be known on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
Second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November increase of the ISC to 4.1% was a "temporary" number, but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively "high" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes stated in Congress's rounds that "even if it is not a favorable number," Spain's inflation differential towards monetary union has been the same over the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," said the Minister of Economic Affairs on the data submitted today.
Virgin plans to make EUR 42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock Bank was in crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually fell within two and a half months of the client's mistrust despite the fact that the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virginia, which will replace the name of the entity with its brand name Virgin Money, needs to obtain about a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks in the next three years in order to obtain the remaining £18 billion and thus achieve the target of £30 billion.
The tycoon of Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom with his flagrant advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve his purpose.
This week, Northern Rock Bank identified the Virgin consortium's offer of three other companies as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices during construction
In the early hours of the morning, the Civilian Guard apprehended the current mayor of the city of Totan (from the People's Party) due to his alleged involvement in corruption practices during the construction that were revealed this week.
Also, one of the City Hall's secretaries and the head of the local police were arrested.
In May of this year, José Martínez Andrea replaced Juan Morales, a contemporary folklore member, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to the investigative sources addressed by Caden SER, could be the 'head' of the whole business.
Police officers continue to monitor city hall buildings and the construction commission and do not rule out further arrests in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the chief suspect in the corruption practices of construction, was charged with being discovered at the beginning of this week.
As Caden SER reported yesterday, a 'humane' lawyer named Juan Morales, who was investigated, was arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to the sources of investigation, the investigation into Morales' alleged commission collection for his signature of the construction agreement with the Galician construction company, which had been re-qualified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are being detained at the moment.
Bono has accepted an offer to lead the Toledo PSOE candidate and, if they win, to chair Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to lead the next general election of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the general election, he became President of Congress.
This was announced at the press conference by the PSOE Secretary for both José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place today at noon at the federal seat of the party.
The executive chief explained to the former minister that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best" .
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
As President of Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marían, who, on 15 November, published his decision not to run in the next general elections and abandon his active political career in order to pursue the fight against climate change in university education.
The former Minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly urged him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He further stated that, as well as citizens, he knew who would be the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs if PSOE won the election, his party wanted to announce "in a transparent form" who would be chairman of Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect, not a house of swearing or screaming, " and to achieve that "it will become more and more like the citizens. "
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where there is no calm and peaceful talk is Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion"
Similarly, he gave commendable words to present - day President Manuel Marino and "his good work " and did not yet want to imagine himself in his place so as not to lower himself to what his adversaries might consider "greatness. "
Climatic propaganda
Given that the climate change movement is subject to ruthless persecution, both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show firm coherence.
Moreover, to have a leader of a movement that is Prime Minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal urges him to explain why its government's activities or inaction have contributed significantly to Spain's leadership in the European Union in failing to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors it is happening and why its government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to slow down climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, which population habits will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But we didn't get that kind of explanation, and we're not gonna get that.
It's because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (the Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of elections that he has hastened to reject it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet so that it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the covenants with the planet; this gentleman so useful to election campaigns, who does not speak, accuses, demands nothing, but is an ornament of meeting and inspires tenderness.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contracting party and does not ask us to ride our bike and cool ourselves off with a fan.
Mayor and chief of local police Totana detained on suspicion of corruption practices during construction
As the investigators informed, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the city of Totana, the "people" of José Martínez Andrea, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hospitality entrepreneur, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the town hall, whose premises are now located along with a number of police officers who also arrived at the Commission for Construction and the Municipal Company for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests were added to six in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, in an operation involving over 2 million hectares of agricultural land being re-qualified to land suitable for development so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 houses there.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged in a short trial in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
Six of the first arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales are being investigated.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency, registered today in Totana and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, was also charged.
Manuel N.A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which bribes were handed over.
The investigation is carried out by a crime group under the construction of an operational central unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to arrest, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to arrests, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas ( Madrid Province) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of the very well-known owner of the poultry-meat company, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the position of the largest residential complex of the city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa."
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the settlement of a village with 25 000 inhabitants.
Nuaria Group is formed by companies such as Autesa and Inononuar, which are engaged in the promotion of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which is engaged in direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
That's what happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18th, on the same day that Blackburn's book critics happened to appear there:
"The scope of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with tragedy at a school in the city of Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his notes the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the school councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the website of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical position on Plato and claim that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague informs of the introduction of the criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Penal Code:
A. The withdrawal of one song would be a crime of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you steal less than 400 euros in a store, it is considered a mere offence (§ 623.7).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1,000 from the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than the withdrawal rate (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than the download rate (§ 244.1)
D. It's less serious to participate in a fight than compact shifts.
Participation in riots has a rate from three months to one year (section 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than the download of a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punished than the provision of pornographic material to young people (§ 186).
So if my colleague's right, someone's hand got away, and that's a good one.

My attending physician is shoving me one of his articles on weird research called "Money Causes Brain Activation, Especially If Others Get Less."
That is, the feelings raised by a monthly salary for employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at Bonn University using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomographer and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the group leader of Life&Brain Institute's Neurocognition in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong. "
Researchers observed that if both succeeded, received the same salary, activation was mild, but when one received double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The applicant for the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly chasing a Balkan war criminal from the State Prosecutorship of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladič and former leader of Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadžič, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which he took over the title of the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not mentioned in Spain) who, at the rate of the detective thriller, follows from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in the pursuit of escaped criminals and pressure on the respective states to pull the net.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a considerable expense that depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to figure out what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insurance amount of a certain amount for taking care of the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance which is determined in respect of various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle which is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the likelihood of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies concluded that persons living in a marriage have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way in which the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving and thus the probability of having an accident.
The growth in driving rates increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the premium price.
Therefore, the driver has to study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that is best suited to his profile of the insured person.
We will show here the most important variables for the selection of one or the other type of insurance, which, in addition to satisfying the type of insured person, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under 25 years of age encounter different disadvantages such as little experience in driving and short possession of a driving licence when they want to arrange insurance at an affordable price.
Although ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper variants.
The most careful drivers may choose insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance to obtain insurance coverage of all risks but at the most acceptable price.
This kind of contract would assume the client's involvement in the payment of the insurance event.
"Part of the payment of the insurance event provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the premium price, which will be the higher, how lower would be the participation', explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants in the operation so that the client will be insured against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate held by the insurance company.
On the other hand, malus is the increase in the basic rate mentioned.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to raise the bonus" explains Noguera.
After crossing the border of twenty-five years, it is easier for drivers to arrange insurance because the client risk index decreases, thanks to acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people are usually unable to take advantage of the experience acquired in advance at the moment of the accident and even during driving', the director of the European company in Spain assures and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the procedure when the "fear of the newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, provided that his economic situation permits it.
Families with children are considered as clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a premium discount (which could be EUR 300) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford luxury to get the highest discount," notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended to cover all risks with a premium discount (EUR 150) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a valid reason to properly study the possibilities of insurance that would suit us most in the face of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get a point on AC Milan that means the eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to score a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in the end of the league "Champions" because for the Italians it would mean being the first and for the Scots it would decide the location.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the 5th match by draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure he doesn't get in front of him a Shack with six points to play with Benfika, who has four.
These two games of group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, because AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where he will first join the 13th in the semifinals, in an effort to advance to the final which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive result at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems most likely, although both teams will try to compete for victory, because the Italians will not want to strategize at home and Celtic knows that after winning would be the first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could be enough to advance even if the Shachtor doesn't win, but he can't count on it because at the same number of nine points, Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1) but won in the first straight match (2:0).
And so the players of AC Milan will try to ruin the evening for the Scotsmen who believe that they will get to the semifinals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League just as they defeated them in the same game in the last game with the goal of Kaka in overtime (1:0) after a state of 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hoping to win the "rossoners" will be the Shaft, for whom it is worth winning if Celtic loses, both for the advance to the eight-finals and for staying in the UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no chance to continue the highest European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls group started their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver, they declared that the reconnection of their group was "great."
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present at a concert, which also included a video that depicts the history of this group, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as a new album published by the EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main successful songs as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo."
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice," British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, although Nervous Victoria forbade him a few days ago.
Before the show, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to contradictions between us" caused the disbanding of a five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness when meeting journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the reconnection of the group that she herself dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things have settled and we all love each other very much. "
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to TV CTV, the group came to Vancouver with the Virgin Airlines special.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of nannies awaited them.
Five have seven children in total.
After a concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
He'll be performing in Madrid on December 23rd.
Fears of a new gas fight between Russia and Ukraine
There is now a dispute over gas prices between Russia and Ukraine, and there is an increased risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of Russia's fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is led by pipelines across Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raised gas prices to Ukraine, Russia would be charged higher transit charges.
The previous dispute between these two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kyiv and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more, since he has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said the Ukrainian economy minister Anatoly Kinach to Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the level of transit charges (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has caused a devastating fall in exports to Western Europe, which has sharply increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The controller said that the Scottish NHS Chambers must improve the control of criminal records for non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of Robert Black's Supreme Audit Office came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the number of foreign personnel he employs.
But his report emphasized that other key controls were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately after the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Eighteen - year - old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who showed up at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of connecting to attempts at bombings in the UK.
The NHS chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the UK before their employment.
Although Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to control criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report from the President of the Supreme Audit Office states, among other recommendations, that the Commission should be led by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines that help employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS is much in agreement with its own pre-employment clearance policy, but he also added: "Our report draws attention to areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the number of foreign personnel. "
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr Peter Terry, said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report indicates that current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS work well and it is unclear what other value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1, 161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably be higher also because the commission had a problem identifying personnel with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for the NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently redoing the policies and directives of pre-employment controls for foreign NHS personnel.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport. "
It also added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the health committees, will consider the recommendations of this report and will ensure that the best practices appear in the updated pre-employment guidelines for all personnel - including the foreign one - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division has taken over the movie awards
Control, a biographical film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for the best film.
The prizes were also won by the star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis' role, director Anton Corbijn and in the secondary role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress for the thriller Scandal Notes.
And the star of the Daniel Craig Bond movie got Variety Award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The awards were ceremonially presented at London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost only £3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two prizes - for the best director and for the best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - because Julien Temple's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the best documentary award.
Viggo Mortensen won the best actor for the role of Russian mob boss driver in the London thriller David Cronenberg Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation based on the roles of tough guys, won the Richard Harris award for an extraordinary contribution to British film.
This 50 - year - old, whose films include, for example, Scum, Nile By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prizes, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers sit.
Among the supporters and patrons of Bif are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for a terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it arrested 208 militants due to membership of cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities as well as on the spiritual and security forces.
State television reported that one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathists campaigned against the monarchy, United States allies, since 2003, i.e. since the invasion of Iraq.
The television report announced that an eight militant cell led by a foreigner was planning an attack on oil equipment in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia has been building a unit of rapid reaction of 35,000 members to defend the facility since the failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrested were part of a cell led by the "missile launch experiment" that slipped into the country.
She also stated that militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try harder to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda militants fighting allied forces and the Shia government supported by the US, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider heresy.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities have co-opted many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to support the royal families who control the government.
The militants - supported by the challenges of al Qaeda leader Saoud Osama bin Laden's leader, focused on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings, and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," the ministry's internal spokesperson said.
A 16 - member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested to promote "Takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims called infidels and apostates.
Among the arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate of Venus may be a glimpse of the future of the Earth
Scientists reported yesterday that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from an orbiting European station show that the planet is even more like the headstrong twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit along similar lanes, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could also be habitable.
But the runaway greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation, and lower rotation rates were sent by Venus after a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by storms and hurricane-power winds.
The findings from the Venus Express European Space Agency probe, which studied the planet for one year, offer a modest view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford Department of Physics and one of the leading missions of Venus Express said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus began as much as the Earth, possibly with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
The police have intercepted "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
Police spokesperson said that three people were detained and the material is being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
♪ Still wide open ♪
Mitt Romney said it's not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates then agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions broadcast on Wednesday, November 28, were as comic as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the state of the Republican party towards the elections next year.
It is not clear exactly how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest Republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the disc when they heard something comforting: the announcer recorded the verdicts of consent when the candidates spoke of hard border access.
The hardest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who poke himself forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
These two struggled particularly when the questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
The side candidates, like Duncan Hunter, the California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, the Congressman of Colorado, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on this subject.
None of these two have a chance at nominations, but both of them are still in the game because they started hitting the alarm for immigration sooner and harder than the others.
At least the candidates have the same view of immigration: greater rigor at borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with the fears of poisonous toys from China and other concerns about the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani has been asked why he has supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the technique of simulated heating should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if candidates believe every word in the Bible.
Mr Giuliani stumbled to the conclusion that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he does not believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now first against all assumptions in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning laughter.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr Huckabee's increase in Iowa is in line with recent achievements in raising money and Ron Paul's loud cheer during Wednesday's debate.
These two have bounced from the bottom, because both sides' wings still cannot agree on more famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning report on American size on the lips, winking at both sides.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pain
Gordon Brown once again found a trap in which he could fall; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
There doesn't seem to be any orders sold, no accounts at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would do without discovering that a wealthy businessman has been masking contributions to the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people for four years, and that the party has not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision had not been affected by the polls, there was hope that it would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the more and more witty acting President of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once feared Mr Brown has turned Stalin into Mr Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock's troubled bank showed weaknesses in driving and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative failure.
The three retired generals started a mutiny in the House of Lords; they protested cuts in military spending, claiming that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and their former internal discipline watchman), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inexorably heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a point of tilt, at which they find government difficult.
People don't trust politicians and they don't like them, but they usually shift their distrust when the new gang takes over.
When it seems clear that some prime minister probably doesn't improve anything, and maybe he doesn't have to be in office for a long time, it's moving away: the government becomes leaky, ministers start making briefings, the press looks for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, since he cannot take the position of a new broomstick compared to other political leaders.
As much as he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial office records are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair's troubles, such as a long investigation into the funding of political parties caused by "values for money," voters can easily conclude that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they look.
Those misconceptions aren't as bad as the Conservatives do.
As far as Mr Bean is concerned, no one has died or been directly deceived.
And the treatment, as painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The latest turmoil about political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but it wasn't up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might buy access to those who govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' progress, but he did not know that he was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly questioned; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief laborer who learned about the tricky gifts in October.
But yet Mr Brown is not involved in any way; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these machinations, although the main part of the payments took place only after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
Very quickly he condemned this violation by his own party, but he diluted his resolve by reaching out for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, this is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has not had one for six months, and moving forward with the real reform of political funding.
This would require laborers who are in trouble to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with trade unions - bitter pills for a dedicated strategist like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to get his voters back; and the only way to work out victory is to have indisputable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the sub-prime mortgage crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, the back fins begin to flutter excitedly around.
Now that the US real estate market is fading, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that credit card losses, if more consumer credit options were infected from sub-prime mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clear.
The number of inability to pay (with more than 30-day delay) and written-off accounts (accounts that the provider considers to be unenforceable) is increasing.
Last month HSBC announced that it lost $1.4 billion in the US consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it's still early to panic.
There is still little to pay off the bills and the inability to pay back.
According to Moody's valuation agency, 3.89% of the default rate in the third quarter was almost a percentage point below the average.
Deterioration rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US Personal Bankruptcy Act of 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which make a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciations) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good maturity rate which shows how much consumers pay off their debts monthly.
And trust in credit card-backed securities is solid, despite paralysis in other parts of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup's research firm predicts that their emissions in 2007 will be 25% larger than last year.
There are certainly direct ways to spread infections between the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when they dry out property loans, consumers are more indebted by credit cards.
However, credit card publishers tend to look at cash flow rather than the value of warranty items, so falling house prices may not necessarily mean changing the credibility of borrowers.
They may even be beneficial for loan providers.
Consumers' motivation to pay off mortgages decreases when their assets fall below the value of the loan; consequently, the debt on cards shifts up on the list of repayment priorities.
Card publishers can also respond faster and more flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid changes in the prices of guaranteeing objects.
"It's not gonna happen that one beautiful morning we're just gonna rethink all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Financial Manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of sub-prime mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more realistic.
If lower house prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those back flippers.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in a fraud involving former financial group leader Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their story on Wednesday and admitted their guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially blamed seven fraud charges, when they and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- to enrich themselves on behalf of their employers -- denied.
They were to stand trial in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to a fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest executives, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC units, has been on the front pages for two years, which took the issuing procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished parts of an investigation initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 pointed out to Mr Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's collapse.
Prosecution against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot fraud along with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner branch controlled by Fastow, who was an architect of a lot of Enron scams that pushed Enron in a spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch with zero, but our three British knew that it was actually of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought a bank's share in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid the Koppers $250,000 for their stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the power company would pay $20 million for its stake in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But the $20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the prosecution, the bankers received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others increased by roughly $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving three years in prison and one month in a facility in Texas.
All three British people were free on bail for $1 million, ordering them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their role in the collapse of society.
Skilling is serving more than 24-year sentence.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's Non-Helplessness
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for 24-hour years from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, they are small to return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Deputy Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places, because it's for a narrow family or corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of spectacular consumption in the mammoth exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers have built their stands, hoping that freshly rich Russians will lure everything from mahogany yachts to diamonds decorated with car counters for which they would not be ashamed even 50 Cent.
Mr. Firmer looked carefully for a bright orange Porsche in the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's dimes and dimes against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
On the waves of oil, money flows into Russia's capital just like when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans became hugely rich and went to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listener of the fourth year at Davis' center of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard.
Just like Saudi pushers from the '70s and Japanese in the '90s, the Russians become the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share on this Klondike.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry of Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of the LVMH Group, brought together ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as Russia.
(The Conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of the richest people, Forbes magazine has 53 billionaires with a total fortune of $282 billion.
In addition, the Centre for Economic and Financial Research's local central institute has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 there were 15,8% of Russians below the limit of the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representatives of the London jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are well-groomed and men are every man for a fortune."
When they walked in evening dresses on Sunday evening halls, 21 - year - old Evgenia Yumatova and five years older Svetlana Turovcova called themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who shrouded in designer clothes like a red carpet veteran, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a housewife.
The trade fair seemed to be focused mainly on fresh wealthy people, brand-controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit for several hours in the road traffic so that they could walk around the warehouse, which shuffle Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiards tables, apartments in Dubai, plushs Gund and drafts.
The members of the simple public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr.Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before reproduction of Rembrandt's painting from hand painted blue tiles in overlife size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in glamour."
And indeed, the shopkeepers here say that Russians with old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from shiny logos to little-known labels limited by editions that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said that he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads, after $70,000.
Also on the first day Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, told high-end cars with high-end alarms that his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, announced that he had sold three car bars in the style of chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner who had an outfit covered with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four such.
"The Russian millionaire who wants an ostrich leather wheel or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconium does not have to ride the wheels yet," said Mr Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean anything very exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the prices of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at a stand run by the Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company raised four red British-style phone booths stuffed with a column of fake bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, marketing manager of the company, stated that his team had printed 500,000 fake notes for the Millionaire Fair.
The passers-by stopped to throw around a bunch of money, or to let friends take pictures of them on their cell phones, resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or just stuffing a couple of millions of pockets.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked from the large windows of the local restaurant A little healthier and watched an ambulance that arrived at a white Neo-English house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon the police patrol car was joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the medical examiner arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41-year-old, executive assistant to the head of the Newwar Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities haven't figured out what caused Miss Arroyo's death yet, and they're hoping to help solve a mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness to the heads of the Newwar police.
Miss Arroyo has been assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough and hard-working," said McCarthy about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would have protected me."
Mr McCarthy said that Miss Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newwar police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drinks Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, Union District Attorney's spokesperson, Theodore J. Romankowa, said that detectives are trying to find out if Miss Arroyo died from an unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. 21.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is supposedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities questioned Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday in Miss Castro's house, with a broken rose bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, nobody answered.
Next to the door that led to the basement, there was a blue barrel in an open garage with the word "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain bikes hanging on the hooks on one side.
Mr McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in the New York Police Department in Newark after 25 years, Miss Arroyo provided invaluable help in chewing through the unbearable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this one or this one," he said.
"She was always there when I came in, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market's hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were strengthened by the reassuring statements made by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
Exchanges jumped in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Ben Bernank, chairman of the Fed, said that in responding to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets, the executives must be "flexible and pragmatic."
As part of a clear attempt to calm the irritated markets in the midst of the hints of a resurgence of credit effort, Mr Kohn said that recent upheavals "in part reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October."
He further stated that if increased instability persisted, the possibility of further worsening financial conditions for households and companies would increase.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh capital benefits to the US markets, and possibly further interest-rate cuts to stabilise credit conditions.
These comments also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of other bad news about the US economy when the sale of flats in October showed record low figures.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns of the investment bank that it would cancel 650 jobs, which is 4% of its world workforce, in order to reduce costs due to compensation for the heavy losses caused by the failed bet on the provision of sub-standard housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13 289.40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6 306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions on the markets turned out to be in full force after lending to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7% at the auction of three-month money packages of the European Central Bank, which is the most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release above-standard money to London's money markets has increased, with the rates of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" rising from 12 November to its maximum since the end of September - 6.59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's gonna be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Sri Lanka test, who's supposed to make that decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the committee, who is at this post at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, the decision-maker, and because Hugh Morris, the chief manager of the English team, is starting to fill the applications for the post of national collector, although not necessarily full-time.
Whoever isn't put in sixth place on a bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes due to lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult and requires an opinion, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the commission - a place for only one.
Who's to say what level is right for a cricket player if he doesn't get a chance to drop or float to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a great influence on decision making, but so do opportunities.
On the team, the cricket player must at the right moment capture the captain's sight if he should take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances of starting positions, if he should ever make an impression as a one-day cricket.
It's more complicated to get a look at the collector.
For example, last season there were many better ones, which James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first class at 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at an equally modest average but they both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next.
If he's gonna play at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish both careers, or it may not have much influence.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and served good performances in the first class, five wickets and 40 vacation runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who, at the same time, fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricket, who is additionally, even though he recorded twice a hundred points against Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's clean training at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah, his sparkly and valuable debut test shifts speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class compared to six Bopars, who, at the age of 22, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah did in two shifts in May against the Caribbean at the Test at Lord's, his home playground at Middlesex, only ten runs, along with the immediate rejection of collectors, when Vaughan wanted to reinstate him for the next match, his batting seems to have taken something out of the spirit that was so obvious in Mumbai.
On the other hand, the Essex Universal has a joie de vivre in his bones.
On the cricket field, nothing frightens him, and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently inverted four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and apparently shock, but the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-fast skid pitches on the local playgrounds, which seems to suit it, distributes effectively and launches confidently and skilfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm leaning towards Bopar getting his chance now, which I don't want to say is Shah not going to excel unless, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he's the one who's going to play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and into the fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, emptying refugees who had run out of money or expired visa periods, and others hoping that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed men who drove them out of their homes.
Mansour Bus Station was already 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the papers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to Shia's militia of militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to abort the fight.
Kassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from mostly the Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew Syrian visas and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work there.
His Shia neighbors in Amariya called him saying that the local militia with the support of the U.S. Army helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shia tribe, whom he expelled from his home in Sleikh, North Baghdad, after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The day before yesterday, several friends called me and told me that he was running a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and that he needed me and my boys' support.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many spoke of the attractiveness of tranquillity in the capital after strengthening America's military presence and the growth of local "groups of biased citizens" that defend their neighborhoods with arms in hand alongside the US army.
But it was more said that the obstructions surrounding visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years, caused them to return.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three children, expressed out suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and thus forced them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled Iraq's sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," said the Sunni retirees.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left."
A partial reason for weakening violence is the fact that the Sunni have been pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which reduces tension in many places.
There is concern that the sudden influx of refugees will once again stir up sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Sarah, good education
Germany's smallest country plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even with the international focus of its universities.
In just one educational area, Sarah is concerned about the same deficiency as the rest of Germany.
"I explained to a man who doesn't come from Sársko yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this self-ironic motto appears on the posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country's birthday in Sársko.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the Sarge education system.
As a result, universities have traditionally been working closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
Which corresponds to an appropriately high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Sara's children are admitted to college - many of them even without a high school degree.
"Axel Plünnecke, IW's educational expert, is being used in Sársko. "
By obtaining more than one fifth youth's qualifications to study at a vocational school, Sarah is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are plenty of possibilities in Sársko to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two fields are the second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, engineering graduates have fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education of Sara has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have implemented several reforms in general education schools," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
The government therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is a free model taken over by other federal countries.
If the results of pupils improve significantly, they will show future comparative studies.
In the course of the study, Pisa decreased from 29 to 20% in 2003.
However, in total, Sardinia has not improved as much as other federal countries.
The lads can count better.
And to the disappointment of Sársko studies, Pisa does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarah could score in this area.
Neighbor tongue is mandatory at grammar schools - even if the people of Sara are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
The clock in Venezuela will soon be different from the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will have hours moved back half an hour in this South American country.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
According to the new law, the official newspaper of Venezuela reported that hours will shift by less than four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the US, justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the United States to divide the world's time zones throughout the clock.
In addition, in the middle of local time, Chávez announced that because of the case with the hostages, he was interrupting relations with neighboring Colombia.
This left-wing nationalist said that as long as Alvaro Uribe is the conservative president of Colombia, he would not have any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can no longer, because of my self-esteem," said Chávez, who promotes the reform of the constitution, which the citizens of this oil country must vote on in the Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would greatly strengthen his power in the country.
The argument was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe "spit in the face " by his decision to Venezuela criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone talks about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone here caused a commotion: "Por qué no te callas" - a sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
It was spoken by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American Summit, was so upset by the loud remarks made by this leftist populist that he silenced him in this way.
Germans are facing lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are facing a reduction in real wages despite strong booms.
Experts justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can actually expect to receive a lower wage than last year.
"The blame is a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the research institute IMK (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New burdens on employees may also be waiting in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that a reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation for a new year.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not again fall into such difficulties in order to require loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, citing the newspaper of this social democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and oil products has driven inflation to its highest level in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased overall by 3%.
Venus is the Hell's Twin Earth
Despite its life's hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than ever expected. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus recorded phenomena that appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and windwaves at the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is shining.
Now the European Venus Express probe has brought proof - it has captured electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, written in Nature Christopher Russel's scientific magazine from the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory of the origin of the primary matter, life could be created on Earth by lightning. Storms reportedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
This was not the case with Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures of about 500 °C.
"Venus may be a hellish twin Earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, who is so similar to the Earth in matter and size, began to evolve completely differently, is the fundamental issue of the Esa mission.
Since no probe has been sent since the early 1990s solely for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in this planet's research.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which brought several articles of Nature closer, did not just emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like the Earth than previously anticipated," said Esa.
In addition to the already known wind vortexes at the North Pole, scientists found a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which revolves considerably faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km it is almost the same size.
This planet, called Mortar or Evening Hall, will circulate the sun in nearly 225 days.
But it rotates much slower around its own axis. One day on Venus it takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus' surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars does not remind the Earth, scientists are based on the fact that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both of them, the water piled up, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while Venus evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound to Earth in carbonates, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for the termination of party disputes over the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office.
Indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany's reputation and calls on the great coalition to end the conflict surrounding the Dalai Lama's adoption.
"We should not present ourselves on the outside as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal for me," Köhler said.
Although the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent Merkel from defending himself when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Clave Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China also knows that," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was therefore attacked from among the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "predictive" foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, the so-called strategic dialogue of both countries' foreign ministries has also frozen.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao emphasized China's position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located in China, is trying to separate itself from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France
Street fights with police, gunfights, fired cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not become violent on the street, calls on the Federal Interior Minister.
The barricades were on fire, rioters shot shotguns at the police. After serious youth riots in France, the Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create any social tension in our country, which will break out in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said in the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, the countries and municipalities are already working hard to address the problems, said Schäuble.
Which doesn't just mean integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we record the first achievements."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
During the past nights, young people and police in the northern suburbs of Paris fought hard street fights.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
More integration efforts of the German Government were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effect. "
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
However, it should still be done.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate is above average among people under 25 years of age who come from migrant families.
Above all, a greater number of study opportunities must be provided.
Kolat emphasized: "We must give young ones hope. "
However, the chairman of the Turkish municipality added that, unlike France, there is greater social control of families in Germany.
Moreover, many youths from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "We still have to pay attention. "
We must "make it quick for the young ones to start working and learning. "
Meanwhile, the night remained mostly quiet in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter was flying over the area with headlights.
The authorized authorities reported three arrests and several trash bins and cars lit.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 law enforcement forces have taken care of the peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary after visiting the suburb of the Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's riots took hold.
A Sunday car accident caused a mess in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the state's attorney's office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of teenagers.
In the realm of Angela "The Clouds"
The Chancellor's remote output documents that the coalition is at the end of the program and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferently sounding and content-poor speech at the general debate of the Federal Assembly, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, manage.
Angela Merkel answered with one very arrogant sentence to regret that she was too focused on foreign policy.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
In the Federal Assembly, she showed everyone how much she deserved the remorse.
Merkel didn't feel any real interest, let alone a sense of trouble in the country.
Instead, Angela "Shade" was presented: a politician who excels at others who flees to foreign policy and even there is only vague expression.
For example, climate protection: it is constantly being praised for the conclusions drawn from the Heiligendamm summit, but it is no longer saying how the climate targets should be achieved in Germany.
Anyway, such self-preservation - so much modesty would have forgiven the CDU president two years ago.
It is now limited to idle phrases that could increase her popularity among humans.
This approach damages his imij pragmatists, who do not need to flatter because they solve problems.
But in the realm of Angela Clouds, internal political problems are marginal issues.
Child poverty and the care of people with low wages?
She's got a few side sentences left on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel cries out when it comes to child support.
Three times Merkel has to start over in order to say at least partially the right sentence.
As soon as things get too specific, it stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
In the case of the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, the debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube has been heated in a heated debate - and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already apparent on the first topic.
Mitt Romney is throwing Rudy Guiliani to his opponent that he turned New York into "a refuge for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp remorse: "I think his own home was one such refuge," he answers, and he throws to former governor Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without documents.
Since the Republican base does not yet have a clear favourite, eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, web-based and YouTube-based videos only serve as such help to a key topic.
"This is exactly the policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power," says John McCain to his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain spares neither his remorse nor Romney for refusing to condemn a tortured method of interrogation called "Waterboarding" in which the heater is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the torture methods are among the important topics of the campaign.
The audience breaks out in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney in dismal terms and asks the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for being a proponent of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rule for the first time in civilian life
The day after his resignation as chief commander of the army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
That concludes eight years of military government in Pakistan.
President of Pakistan Parvíz Musharraf took the presidential oath on Thursday and will remain in the presidency for the next five years.
Pakistan's television was a live ceremony held in the Presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, an army commander in chief, and thus subjected himself to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West by resigning as Chief Armed Forces Commander.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional condition declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Deputy Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the West's demands.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, following the announcement of a state of emergency at the beginning of November, occupied its favored lawyers, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Vaziristan, and four others were injured.
Army spokesperson said the bomb went off on a road near the Afghanistan border.
Crautrock's Fathers Return
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of Harmonia took up their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will include Live 1974, a haircut from the most successful band period.
They were already much more famous abroad.
The announced sensation then consists of a performance by three settled gentlemen who initially look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone's got a box, cables, and mostly buttons.
Thirty-six-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in a snow-white shirt in the middle.
On his left is the 27-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, a 37-year-old who bows intently over synthesizers, is from the viewer's point of view on the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by mistake, they become a traditional piece.
The musicians seem to be okay with that.
Among the Krautrock lovers, a revival of the Harmonia band caused considerable commotion.
One thing is worth noting, repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not enough to be missed by someone for 23 years.
But why couldn't a German celebrate his still-living 1970s legends?
And especially when they value their musical style, a misnomer called crautrock, in England and America, more than they do in their own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the Echo Prize to the surviving members of the Cologne group, the hall was filled with the thrilling views of German pop fans.
Moreover, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the audience's astonishment no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later at Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoring abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we overwhelm memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at that time it was far from having the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius have played with artist Conrad Schnitzler before under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the cellar of Berlin's Schaubühne Theatre.
Then Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, with a gramophone company run by the Church.
Rother helped briefly with the Kraftwerk group, but gained reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at that time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster band into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as members of the commune that fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to to toil like a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a spitzwegian artistic existence.
The name for the particular art is allegedly derived from the name of the chorus Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the trash can.
Harmonia has preserved many of this.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the following "De Luxe."
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Picking up roasts wasn't just self-discovery.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been edited in front of a record small, barely 50-man scenery during a concert in Grisesem.
Rother then expressed the desire for the members of Harmony to get excited and practice occasionally.
For Roedlius and Moebius, that was a completely rude request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and insured his future with the album "Flaming Heart."
The Cluster band came back to life in the 1980s, and since then it has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Grönland took Krautrock's goal to cherish as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
The present will be British, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
We have thus outlined the overall scope of Krautrock's influence on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian En, accompanied by the most bizarre sounds, hovers in the hall: "The only true music belongs to her future. "
There are images of a producer with Harmony in a peasant's seat.
Projection of other black and white photographs with a set of wildly connected cables also contributes to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are back to being improvised.
Not by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to get the unheard-of tones out of the tools.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the meticulous technique.
It doesn't change anything, nor does the Congregation of the House of World Culture.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, there is whispering under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place there is an emphatically singing "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Rather than in blues, we would find roots in musical universities (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts '68!' in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia is not going to let himself get out of the way now.
Even the most obvious of all is thought carefully on the scene.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question either robs a person of nerves or allows him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden featured two films about the war in the Balkans.
But neither one of them is convincing.
The design of films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Even an actor like Richard Gere can't stop him at The Hunting Party.
The good news is first: the Karadzić and Mladić war criminals are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but that is where, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere will find himself.
Lately, we've lost sight of this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he's played in a lot of cute, ruthless roles in cool women's movies, but in conjunction with his press conferences on Buddhism, they're gonna take you to another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for viewing The Hunting Party - Where the hunter becomes the prey (Why do movie names have to be so long and tangled today?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could become if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him, but still retains some remarkable charm as a ruin like a memorial.
But despite this trump card, the Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinemas this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and one of them will fall in love with her.
Although it is commendable that Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television-flavored film is changing too early in the shooting and action.
The film will remain something very similar to the series Kobra 11, without the highway, but for the war.
At The Hunting Party, we can clearly examine why the Balkans have not yet been able to make a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters going after the "fox," a Serbian war chief criminal, could become a new "Apocalypse" at a different time and under the direction of another director and writer (here is both Richard Shepard).
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the woods to do something that the army is not capable of, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauchery and sentimental cynic that was introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft will also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
We can definitely write off The Hunting Party after reporters have done what NATO, the CIA and all the world's criminals have failed to do in the last five years: capture criminals and abandon them to the righteous revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of filmmaking that it's worth turning to the International Court of the Hague.
In doing so, this film has a profound human message.
It condemns that Karadzić and Mladić are still at large, and suspects Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they do not engage in persecution on the basis of secret political agreements in an intense manner.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women attack us the famous Brecht poem.
In it it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writing's work desk: "With compassion I look at the swollen veins on my forehead, marked: how strenuous it is to be evil. "
In movies like The Hunting Party, they perform exactly the kind of swollen heads that suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
Recently, these newspapers said that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
There is only one thing to add: No good film about South Africa has ever been made.
Almost always true: When a star wanders around a crisis area or walks around a minefield, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Breaking Boundary with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio is created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler List.
Many movies must probably be ripe - movies that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter," "The Apocalypse" or "The Lead Vest" - were in no way celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home shows up on two screens, we know too much about this world's conflicts.
The writers don't have the ability to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terriblely the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcastically distant artistic view as a novelist named Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary " and "Balkan War, " he stated: "The resemblance is merely that some things never change.
Large cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrible way and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for the resignation of the Olympics
The Mayor's resignation from the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has come across a fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, urges realism in the estimation of chances.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called this decision "unhappy in terms of business" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently aroused as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporty political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic by at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sport Union will decide on the candidacy of Munich for winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 timetable."
Yet this dream is not yet over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beust's remarks regrettable.
The impression is that Hamburg does not want to apply for the organisation of the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to destroy our chance by marking the plans as buried at this early stage," said President HSB, Günter Ploss, on Wednesday.
The waiver would be contrary to the statement given by the Senate Chief at the General Meeting of the General German Higher Sports Union.
Von Beust did not announce the candidacy of Hamburg at the University of 2015 as a replacement for the organisation of the Olympic Games.
The university sports association Hamburg has only nominated for candidate city in the last week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Parliament of the Senate has accused the Senate of wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hindered by the Senate for years because it has bet on the Olympics and excluded the construction of flats," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region was still planning the Olympics, with the whole area being later used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the Olympian factor.
In 2012, the 2012 Summer Olympics' competition triggered great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
But Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
Those aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever combines the terms of Sweden and wooden boxes doesn't think of Andy Warhol, but Ikea.
Is it?
Wooden boxes produced in Sweden currently cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of his list of the 90-four "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" from 1968, internal research of the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm came with the result of the disillusionment; six "Brillo Boxes" donated by the Museum Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - as are most of the other Stockholm-type "Brillo Boxes" which are in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red and brittle design of Brillo soap cartons.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about artwork, it was about their designs, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo crates in Sweden, but these are not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
The Witnesses at that time now speak of fifteen boxes that were rightfully entered into art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were sold out at auctions for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was produced and exhibited in Sweden about a hundred cases, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 of Hultén's cases were only produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St Petersburg in 1990.
By that time, Warhol was already three years dead.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, examined, apart from six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968, and after their plywood boards were painted with basic paint and cut, were painted with a brush with oil white paint.
On the contrary, the 1990 copy structure revealed that the paint was applied to the plywood board without the previous base coating - in addition, acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official document of Brillo Boxing," the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve said: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, the Moderna Museet will have to be classified six cases from its exhibition collections as "show material - copies."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "core accusations " that were raised in the case of boxes of soap powder.
But the organization is still in relentless silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered to a hotel in Manila, demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption at the elections, told the hotel reporters that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers dedicated to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours before that, about two dozen soldiers were fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court because of a failed coup attempt in 2003, Trillanes was among them.
He used the negotiations to escape with his 30 sympathizers.
