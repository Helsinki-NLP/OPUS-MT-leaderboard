The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advantage of Color People (NAACP) has published warnings for colored people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory state principles and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Recommendations for the State of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay particular attention when travelling across the state as a result of a series of racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state," the Association's statement states.
NAACP stated that it had taken this step on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which make it difficult to defend racistly motivated acts before a court, as well as the conduct of law enforcement authorities that are unduly targeting minorities.
"Citizen's rights are being violated.
People are being stopped by police officers only because of the color of their skin, they are being attacked or killed," said Kansas City Star president NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We have so far amassed the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organisation for the State of the USA.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated insults directed towards black-skinned students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black-skinned man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and the police put him in custody without charging him with committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent statement by the Supreme Prosecutor of the State of Missouri, which states that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared - they should bring money with them to pay their bail or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by state."
According to the FBI's current numbers, there were hundreds of hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, which puts the state in 16th place among all states.
A travel warning is also the answer to the new Missouri Act, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to apprehend people on the basis of a violation of this law which, according to the ACLU, is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but recently the advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't have peace after 12 years!
Murdered is model Sally Anne Bowman.
A girl originally from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie right in the restaurant she worked in, and he stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex with each other and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café and watched a thorough crime scene investigation.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
All he admitted in court was assault on a minor, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of a taxi driver," he falsely claimed.
According to his testimony, the girl was supposed to defend herself with what she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and accused him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his horniness and the taste of a girl.
When he dressed her up after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, that's what Dexie told the police himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," said the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people at large who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the mother of the deceased girl Linda revealed about the disappearance of the urn with the ashes.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prude nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague Intimacy boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic tools.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž went on a bike trip with his friends in Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"The various moles and dolphins, and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with another partner with the German manufacturer of Fun Factory designer erotic aids, which impressed Martin, and so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he operates an Intimacy boutique in Prague's Benedict Street, where he sells erotic aids in a way that usually offers luxurious purses or shoes.
Why wouldn't I?
These are also design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you know?
Oh, come on, don't be such a prude!
The Berlin Fun Factory store, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No hidden expenses, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products displayed more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to take Prague's business, where he should be and what his name should be.
The Intimacy name was both popular.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it is also, you can say, tender," he says.
It followed the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space that went in parallel with various interior visualizations.
In the end, the choice was won, which spread the store into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, which is dominated by the bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem entirely ideal because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting on the name Intimacy again.
He's intimate.
He is in the alley next to the main one, so no one looks at the customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with brand-new pretty goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel comfortable.
And don't make them ashamed that they've ever entered such a store.
When I entered the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to the erotic aid store.
Right at the door I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from fashion boutiques.
Even though there's only women in the store, so that women don't hesitate to ask for help, it doesn't mean that a man's foot doesn't come here.
Most gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't estimate the right size and choose bigger ones," Martin smiles over a common mistake.
It's such a prejudice, the cliché that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith may choose a useless big vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black underwear, whereas women tend to tend to be more of a pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product well called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I do not know which beats because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a touchless clitoris stimulator.
I am struggling with the adolescent need to take a breath of admiration for the serious tone with which the interpretation is being given to me.
It's like it doesn't melt.
And it doesn't actually fold.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's kind of the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator shaped like a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in designing such products.
The second was a vibrator for couples We-Vibe.
He has completely destroyed taboos that may persist in some men and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"There are different variations," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a popular category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the vibration intensity.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose tools and buy classic vibrators, even if they use them externally.
While in Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to tell if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." Most of the sales are mainly masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Teng.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and experience in use.
It's completely different in Japan.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women liked sex toys a lot, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," I'm told.
The mundane one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more related to women using them.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women." Just for the record, what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs aren't that hardcore.
On the contrary, we are a wholesome nation.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of trade is between 35 and 50 years old and "has had some experience both with sex life and with some tools.
Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka care about making sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into Bondage and latex specialties, because we don't have room for it either, and it doesn't exactly fit here.
That kind of thing could discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to a sex shop because they're afraid they're gonna get a look at something like that.
A lot of products on the shelves are really nice.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever prized was the said seahorse 'and it triggered a change in the whole industry.
It started to drop out of cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with healthy ones, to produce other designs, different colors...
Pleasantly, there is a Czech behind the design of some, namely the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I was quite surprised by how many people here whoop.de.doo buys design stuff from Anna Mareš even though they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who come straight for the Venus balls from Anna Mareš.
She has done a great deal of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present within the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic tools can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started as schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big production, but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a big series.
I may be going a little upstream, but it seems important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
We might not be able to produce anything in a few years," Anna explains later, agreeing with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or negative attitude.
They say people are embarrassed at the most.
Anna Marešová currently has a vibrator on offer to get a personal message, and she plans her own lubricant this year.
In the next year, vibration eggs and other news should be added.
The Boundary of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's okay lie.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What comes normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we rather define ourselves by a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them engage in extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one final question: what was the craziest demand they were given?
Just this week, an e-mail came in asking a lady for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural, twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
The question is whether anyone made fun of us," Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
Even that happens from time to time...
A blow to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Charles Christmas is fighting a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true," said the singer himself.
I know about my illness, and so far, I'm handling it quite well under the circumstances.
"I take medications to slow the accompanying phenomena of the disease," he added, thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife is trying to stay home as much as possible, and her daughters from Zuzana and Teresa's first marriage, Karl's son, Karlas, drives to the White Mountain house.
Generous fought cancer twice and gave his experience to Nightingale to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's had 60 chemo.
He managed to get back to work on the tennis court and ski slopes after them.
"From the astrologer, I'm supposed to be here by 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of songs so I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
The same disease is now being fought by actress Květa Puralová at the Institute.
Do you have an Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has abolished the ban on abortion, the Act will assess the U.S.
There is an absolute ban on abortion in Chile, therefore it must not be performed for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide what we have been arguing about in Parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should be given a new president, who according to the AFP is close to the opposition.
The Act repealing the absolute ban on abortion initiated by current president Michelle Bachelet approved the Senate on July 19th.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would attack in court because it said it violated the right of an unborn child to live.
Members postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analyzed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, MEPs approved the proposal, and after them, the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislative regulation, three cases of abortion should cease to be criminal: if a woman's life is threatened, if the fetus does not have a chance of survival, or if the pregnancy has arisen from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile since 1931, before women were elected there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, only a few months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Others are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who serve up to 30 years of prison sentences for abortion.
In many cases, human rights defenders say it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of the statue.
Americans could tell the story as well as everyone else - see carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue on Firdos Square in '03 in Baghdad.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what was coming when he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of Presidential proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigrants.
It's fair to say that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and copycats of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reprimanded Acosta with the words: "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
A poem that was placed subsequently on the pedestal and to which you refer is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
These are first of all the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - he invites not only immigrants but the poorest of the poorest: "Let him go to me, who descends, who is poor, who can barely breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these "poor worms " on our screens.
Miller wasn't trying to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people weren't welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who, after her death, sought to plant plaques with poems on the pedestal of the statue, knew well enough that they were embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the connection of the French and American Republican government by representing the classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
He also has a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
Merging a poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativasm.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right - hand followers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
In 2010, famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist argued that in fact, the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is walking forward.
It brings out a torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to illuminate the road to the United States."
Strangely enough, Limbaugh comes across an important matter.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of a exhausted and damned passenger who often comes to a new land after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean with hope in his heart.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship in athletics 2017: Neil Black sings praises to the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The head of the UK athletic federation Neil Black said that a strong 16 Scottish squadron in the World Championship team would be "a huge asset to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the London 2017 World Championship, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is happening in Scotland" and British athletics could learn anything from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," said Black.
"I talked to the people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The representatives of Scottish athletics think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," said Black.
"Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came out of a room with a feeling of great pride and motivation.
The passion and unhindered feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in the crossroads at 400 m at her fifth World Championship, said that she is "incredible" that there are 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The cross-country runner Muir has set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
The MS will take part in a run of 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scotsmen is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. This season he won the British team races and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The team captain led her to be "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got into the team, but in many cases they will also attack the participation in the finals and medals.
"It was a great honor for me to be the captain of the team, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is all the more gratifying," she said.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scotsmen who made the team.
It proves where we've moved.
They're athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it was a good one.
I merely pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at a race and I'm going to enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: do not take public office unless you can stand the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he wasn't trying to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Free speech can be taken away from us - and stupid and dumb we will be led like sheep to slaughter. "
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on making him act like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Union for Civil Liberties has sued him for these actions.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as unfounded, and there were many "who cares" comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He can boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not disgusting.
As you can see, he runs his own state with certainty and strictly adheres to principles.
It turned out to be also skillful in using Facebook as the main means to connect with its voters - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with bare head after graduating from chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the Governor's website - which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by his employees paid out of taxpayers' money - is useless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor with the fact that blocking comments took place from the post moderation position.
But using an image of Internet trolls, spamers, or angry people is too easy.
Washington Post has interviewed several real people whose contributions have been deleted.
And that is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely remarked that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the Washington Post commentary section.
"I do not like the idea that when a number of people comment on the same subject, some people are called promoting so-called collective efforts, rather than being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam interest" would probably be called "defense."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage our posts by blocking criticisms or deleting negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past when the same procedure would require the posting of employees on the streets where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born in Virginia last week.
According to the district judge James C. Cacherise, President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria to prevent one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the low postage price had practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and many anonymous writers questioned his position as leader.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who write under pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by the people of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have accumulated in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disapproval and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs use more of their tariff than at home.
They are most often in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse on the web, and under the umbrella they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This results from O2's recent statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available on a flat-rate basis than at home.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum of ours travels through the winter, data consumption has even increased fiftyfold this summer.
In the second place, Italy was placed on the list of data consumed.
The Czechs will call from Germany for the most minutes, where many of them go on business and during the summer.
Croatia according to data The Association of Czech Travel Agencies visits 800,000 Czechs annually, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
This year's record was July 7th.
"Dozens of millions of photographs would fit into the data transferred," the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová explained.
Although Croatia is running in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to the fourth and Italy the sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse on the Internet.
"Despite Austria, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While data have been recorded by the operator following the release of roaming charges by high annual growth, the growth in telephone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes reported in roaming increased to double compared to last year.
With a huge head start in front of other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Calling in roaming is more used by business customers on business trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
The former Ronan Rafferty golf leader will hope for a relaxing atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, succumbed to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of ambassador of the tournament on behalf of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about this," said the Southport golfer.
"I didn't have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open, because the year after my victory, the tournament was canceled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when Sharon meant a lot to me and my wife.
It was a beautiful time I wouldn't forget."
Gary Orr returns to homeland, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from this year's region.
This event will be his first participation since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play at home," Orr said about Helensburgh.
"You want to be successful and feel a lot of pressure.
I really liked to play again, and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result."
The three players on the field will also be joined by the former winner of Masters Ian Woosnam and the winners of the senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former captain of Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The admission to the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to the State Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Land
When Bardine Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he takes the potato out and eats it with his hands unwashed.
Bardina sits on a muddy land - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as laundry in cloudy water from nearby swamps.
A bucket in a room without a roof subsists the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was assigned no field for cultivation.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night poses a danger: most villagers are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"After five o'clock this afternoon, no one dares to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of everyday life in the Highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of public upheaval in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua Western Papua independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and devastated city, where you can get after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach gripping with a ride.
Mass traffic in this place doesn't work.
The town with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of wool sheet metal in shades of grey and rusty paint.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no strangers, have looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a shiny skirt.
"We used to only wear leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line, and local child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to some 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015, Freeport mined gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army for the Papuans.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
The Puritans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the tribal region of Papua during the 1970s were equivalent to genocide, as the Asian Commission on Human Rights said.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested over 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a report by the Brisbane Archdiocese of 2016, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, such as out-of-court executions, torture - according to another report, the popular rape and electrocution - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources attracted colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% claim Christianity, but demography changes with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans," explains 24 - year - old Abeth You, born in Paniai and moved to Jayapura Province for work.
"The natives of Papua - mama-mama (women) - have lost their jobs."
As part of his 2014 presidential campaign, Indonesian President Yoko Wido, known as Yokowi, promised to deal with irregularities and violations of rights.
The former carpenter secured his journey to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would answer our call for justice," said You.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jakowi, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark of the night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was given this reproach and tone, which was said to touch and later returned with four other soldiers, by local vicar Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state pursued a group of children and beat them with their arms butts, presented the victims and witnesses of the event.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby electoral commission building, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young papuan men and women gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - running in circles and mimicking the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing rocks at buildings.
With increasing tension, the soldiers were ordered via radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot," said Time magazine in an official document whose content was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the imminent danger and called on the residents to break up into their homes.
No one, however, cared for his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said Time magazine on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people everywhere, and a lot of shootings took place," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to see if it was really him," Yohanes, who uses only one name as many Indonesians, told Time magazine.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
A Papua police inspector, General Yotje Mende, reported to the press that his officers were merely providing a station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people are threatening us with death," said the press spokesperson for the papuan police in 2015, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped from injury.
The murder report went through Jakarta's media the next day.
Three weeks later, Yokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his appreciation for the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, Minister for National Security Wiranto announced that he would implement an out-of-court mechanism to resolve past violent acts.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to echo.
"Most of the violent acts occurred long ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
However, in an interview from June 5 for the Time weekly in Jakarta, Wiranto argued that he was not planning to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be brought before the court"
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor - stated that 11 human rights violations in Papua including the Paniai incident had been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claim with distrust.
"I've been asked four times in the last three years, but I haven't been able to see anything yet," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years after that, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten up by members of the army after helping bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army began looking for me," he said.
And the shooting still doesn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
A struggle, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the owners, and the answer was a warning shot.
However, the locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) started shooting into the crowd and killed one person.
"There was a panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said Domingg Badii, a 29-year-old who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous people from the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and deliberately detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of "containing national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papuai as "a tragic and forgotten place."
Oil pours poverty into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each one cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are for family use, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire opened more air routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants has increased.
So few jobs usually occupy more educated and richer immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the capital and education needed to get into business.
"Young people are moving out of villages due to lack of employment and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basel Longchamp - were expelled from the papui because of the lack of cooperation with the authorities, despite the fact that they were given such a rare permit to film.
In his election campaign, Philim Kine, Deputy Director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Yokowi promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
"For foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and Western Papua there is a great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in his statement.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on the Indonesian case in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua including shooting in Pania.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesperson for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, shook the charges when he declared to journalists in Jakarta that: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and the media are free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations. "
Local people are calling for foreign governments to participate.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people cried out for a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto "we want freedom".
There are other elections scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the pupuans say they won't vote for Yokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of a robbery army - are lying in poverty, miserable education, and health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like the rest of the Papuans, regard their voice as a "debt" that Yokowi must pay back.
"They don't want money, they want justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Paniai shooting, the last symbolic act of defiance continues: they bury the victims' bodies on the property opposite the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice will never be served, at least he won't let the responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy picked up a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy intercepted a 1.46 tons of cocaine worth roughly $256 million in the Pacific yacht.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
The four-man crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, were arrested during the intervention.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America, and the police dragged it to the port in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Service stated that it would seek, in cooperation with its international partners, to identify exactly where and where the drugs were headed and to expose the "Lithuania Syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that stopped a large number of drugs going to Australia," said its CEO Col Blanc.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid hasn't been the first one lately.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia that tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, drinking needs to be reminded.
The problem may be in the elderly's homes, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavela Madlová could be an infusion of saline that is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are only used in medical devices.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body drops.
"And they are losing their sense of thirst, so the seniors generally accept fewer fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," Madlová said.
They should definitely drink two grand.
"But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem," she added.
According to her, no doctor often watches over this in elderly homes.
Hospitals usually deal with dehydration through infusions.
"I think that even there should gradually be introduced so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, she says they can deliver up to two pint bottles of saline to the elderly.
Fluid deficiency can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he speaks confusedly," she said.
In case of neglect, it may result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with duvet, maximum cotton sheets.
Single diapers can also be a problem.
"It is more medically demanding, but it would be ideal to expose the patient occasionally and let the skin air out," said the doctor.
The Torch skyscraper burned for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the world's largest housing skyscrapers was on fire on Friday. Firemen had to evacuate all the inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79 floor buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Torch).
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and the alarm woke us up. We heard screaming.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the skyscraper residents.
Dubai's civil defense stated that the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 a.m. (0:00 GMT), after which they continued to cool down the building.
Government officials have added that they provide replacement accommodation for disabled people.
The incident could once again provoke a discussion on the safety of materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation that launched the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged lining and external panels used for decoration or isolation were damaged.
The British police reported that the London Grenfell Tower isolation and lining system could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the June fire in which almost 80 people died.
Survey results show that more than one of five passengers to the United States is carrying prohibited items on board an aircraft
A survey among passengers has shown that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously delivered prohibited items through the inspection post of the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of the passengers boarded an aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of the passengers claim that they had lately discovered that they had traveled with a firearm, ammunition, or explosive.
The results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1000 respondents replied - showed that younger passengers are more likely to be in breach of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to travel with an object that was banned by TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand flying hours were compared to less than 15 percent of the members of the Generation X.
The most common items that have escaped TSA attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly delivered a sharp object through security, while 2,2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately brought illicit drugs on board the plane.
The company stated that it was conducting research among passengers around the world in order to determine how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized items through airport control and how much they did so on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who carry unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know how much fluid they can put on the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA seized the most forbidden fluid.
For some time, people thought that TSA would deal with books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Fluid transport is permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on delaying planned directives to reduce Obama's administration emissions
After the environmental protection agency was sued by fifteen states, her boss, Scott Pruitt, called off his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes within his plan, responding more quickly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge brought against his previous position in the federal appeal court.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October when States should start to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "impacts on local decisions or imminent economic growth."
Pruitt, who served as State Attorney General of Oklahoma as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations prior to the entry into the role of Head of EPA President Donald Trump.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
Sudden Wednesday's turnover is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the federal court of appeal in Washington ruled that the executor of EPA exceeded his authority in order to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan, which required diesel and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened EPA's commitment to cooperation with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
"During the government of the previous EPA administration, it often did not meet the deadlines and waited for more than a dozen actions to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans," Pruitt said, who filed more than a dozen claims at EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation by means of litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can use "the possibility of delays and all other legally available authorities" at a certain point to ensure that regulation "will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information."
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcription of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't been passed by the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that have been suing EPA this week, said that the group is not going to allow legal pressure.
"The conversion in EPA's views - following our judicial disputes - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone is produced when the normal harmful substances discharged by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in an atmosphere with solar radiation.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists call Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is troubling what pressure must be put to change the minds of the responsible and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests."
He spilled acid on a man, but he's not, according to the court, dangerous.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing, the next, your whole life changes from the ground up.
And worst of all, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was covered with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was given by the Reuters website.
Someone knocked on Christopher's door in December 2014.
Andreas rose to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man he's never seen before in his life spilled acid on him without warning, saying, "This is for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I felt nothing but incredible pain in the skin," Andreas said.
The family quickly delivered him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned terrible news - according to doctors he had no chance of surviving.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His wound was very serious.
Ninety percent affected the face that doctors tried to put together with skin from other parts of the patient's body.
There's been a major complication with Christopher's eyelid loss.
It's probably the most tortured thing I've ever seen.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today, Christopheros has had 12 operations that are far from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, the injuries that the victims suffer from acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have scarred tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover, and they fight deformity and deformity all their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery.
The attacker was wrong.
As far as the attack is concerned, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed that he was avenged by a man who sexually abused his close person.
The police investigated the entire case properly and then tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict on the amazement of Christopher's family changed fundamentally.
"Three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be abolished because a man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the past few years, the number of attacks by corrosive substances has increased considerably.
The Ministry of Interior has expressed its views on the issue by planning to set new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of corrosive substances.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not going to give up.
They demand that the UK Government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require tightened controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in various stores, as these are different cleaning products.
The famous The Torch skyscraper, one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned in the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai.
According to Dubai's civil defense, the population of the 80-story building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread down with falling hot wrecks.
We were sleeping.
The alarm woke us up, people screamed.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that about 40 flats were caught in flames.
The fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when the burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to the civil defense message, the fire was managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
The large fire was damaged by the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred flats.
There are about 680 flats in the whole building.
Even then, no one was harmed because the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and it became the highest residential building in the world with its 352 metres.
Another Dubai skyscraper took his record the next year.
The culturalist had incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a diverse collection of illicit drugs, ranging from steroids to diuretics to medicines for Parkinson's disease or anorexia, was found in a sample of 23 - year - old Ippolita.
Ironically, even this wild mix didn't help him with his title, he ended up fourth.
Now a bodybuilder is in danger of four-year distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugbist Davide Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record number of caught athletes until then.
The third-league player, according to his words, started taking steroids the year before when he flunked bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging an ex-lover!
Lucka Vondráčková has barely entered the Czech Republic, she is busy.
And it also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
At that time, the actor was 12 years older and longed for family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly didn't want to put her career on the line.
So they walked apart, but they remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the news conference TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they were both in blue.
They didn't notice each other at first, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michal's pranks, and she fell behind her stomach.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for the photographers.
Their meeting was no coincidence, however, because they will play a couple of lovers together in the new series Prima Captain Exner.
The Islamists were sentenced to life in Great Britain for preparing the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court put four members of the Islamist cell behind bars who called themselves the Three Musketeers and, according to the prosecution, planned a terrorist attack against the police and the military.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested in August last year.
At the time, the authorities thought he was going to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "infidels" in Arabic, and a pistol makeup.
It happened when an MI5 Secret Service agent placed a listening device in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed the horror the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped," said Deputy Prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for dismissal after 20 years.
The fourth convict, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the London trial, men claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then dismissed the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In Hodonín, they've measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, recorded in Strážnice, Hodonínsk, it surpassed Thursday, which has thus become the hottest day of this year.
This was confirmed by employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But there weren't many temperature records on Thursday compared to Tuesday.
On Tuesday, records of 35 of 145 weather stations measuring more than 30 years were exceeded or evened.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, Břeclavsko, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees lower in the west.
On Thursday, high temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice was the biggest heat in Dyjákovice in Znojemsko and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsko, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but it did not beat the record.
On the other hand, according to the ČHMÚ website in Western and Northwest Bohemia, Thursday's highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"Teplots only started to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear according to ČHMÚ and even more pronounced rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Fridays and in the southeast Moravia on Saturdays.
China's missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions to visa policy.
China has tried for decades to exert its influence without using force.
They spend ten billion dollars a year supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing their entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
That doesn't work for Beijing.
The national media there is talking about a plan to drive tourism into economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year, and around 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assessing the situation in the most populous country in the world, Professor of Economics from the University of Beijing, Christopher Balding, in an article for Bloomberg.
China's visa policy is an example that speaks for everything.
Only 13 countries have visa-free relations with China, the citizens of the other countries must issue visas in advance.
Therefore, the Chinese authorities in the US are similar to Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in line for it, you have to pay extra $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and fewer than one percent of all its inhabitants, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem by using tourism to achieve its political goals, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China reduced transport to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift around South Korea's anti-missile system, the South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year on year, while Japan grew by 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Central Bank of the Fed, China could have left up to $190 billion as a result of China's foreign travels, while China would receive some $35 billion a year as part of its currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on balance of payments, China had a deficit of $ 217 billion last year in tourism, equivalent to 44 percent of China's entire surplus in goods trade.
A small number of tourists, therefore, are taking a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously preventing the flow of capital.
However, the above mentioned factors are only one indication of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places, virtually nobody has heard of immigrants.
Even in 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
Some cities in the United States have more.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has twice that.
In doing so, a number of scientific works show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
In China, however, you will not find them.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian states, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsner Zoo, they multiplied deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Pilsner Kingdom of the poison can enjoy three rare, deadly reptile cubs.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers so far.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"The lengths of three feet are growing," Martin Vobruba, the zoo spokesperson, described.
The youngsters of the other two species, the reapers and cobras of the red, will be gaining strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said Nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
Australian vipers were born eight, descended from a breeding couple from a population around Sydney.
"The individual whom visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the death workers around Perth," Vobuba said, saying that in human care it is necessary for the reaper to winter 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a pack of African spitting cobras of red.
The pair in the Pilsner Zoo was hatched from four eggs in total by four cubs.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," Vobuba added.
This species sprays poison on its victims within a distance of up to four metres.
Aiming for the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species live in the zoo with mouse sticks.
Within 40 days in the garden still expect hatchlings from a pack of mamba black, eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to the unverified transcription of the phone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The U.S. Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with Mexico and Australia's leaders.
In a telephone interview from January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto Trump urged him to stop publicly reporting that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American president blamed him for publicly condemning the building of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and claimed that Mexico would pay for it.
He also leaked a transcript of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. refugee surveillance agreement to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he had agreed to such an agreement - which arose under President Obama's rule - he would have looked like a drugged man after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk testified again at the D.A. for Smolensk.
"He has something to worry about," said Tusk's brother, the President of the Government Party of Law and Justice, PIS Jaroslaw Kaczyński, at Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied and said to the country's current leadership that he was trying to abuse the judiciary against political opponents.
On leaving the district attorney's residence, TVN 24 was waiting for Tusk, a crowd chanting Donald Tusk! and wished a politician 100 years!.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczyński will not intimidate me. "
The prosecutors say they do not blame anything, but they do not doubt that the judiciary should serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against opponents, oppositions or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He's been in interrogation twice.
The exhibitor was interrogated in the D.A. for the second time, this time the interrogation was about the misdemeanor in the autopsies of the victims of the Smolen disaster.
In addition, there was a mix-up of bodies in coffins.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there had to be some reasons.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Keeping good relationships at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU," said Kaczyński on Trwam Catholic television.
He added that any conflict with Russia would thwart Tusk's chances of gaining the most important seat in the Union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also said that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk might be different, but she didn't acknowledge it.
Tusk underwent eight-hour interrogation at the D.A. on 19 April.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many considered his summons to be part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and chief of PiS Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by linking him to various scandals.
The prosecution is in Poland subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who plays the role of Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, whom Kaczyński worked hard, but in vain tried to prevent, among other things, from visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where everywhere can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House of Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared its update, and is currently in a commentary procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for Members abroad.
"There have been some changes since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, which must be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries new representative offices were created, some offices were closed or the level of representation changed," says the material.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which are the representative offices to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the print version.
It's their list of amendments to the decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs were able to vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe, for example.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its representation in Malay's Bamaku and Japanese Kyoto.
There will be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
Newly on the list of embassy in Nairobi, Kenya's capital Dakar and Zambia's Lusace.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has since the last parliamentary elections extended its representation to the Consulate General in Irbíl and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
Vote tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose MPs in polling rooms at representative offices or consulates so far.
Before each election, the State Election Commission shall draw a lottery ticket from the region for whose candidates are voted abroad.
It was the first time in 2002, when the South Moravian candidates decided.
In the following two elections, Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemia's candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemia Region was selected as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
During the premiere 15 years ago, around 3800 people came to vote, in 2006, around 6700 people, four years later 8222.
Four years ago, the early elections came to the embassy of 10.571 voters.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists recalled racist lynching
In 1948, Ford Mercury passed by the viewers Monroe, Georgia, and rocked his way towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before a four - passenger car with a white driver and a black passenger reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns made his way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - long pulled out of a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want the n--and Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence breaks the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over Roger's neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge regularly to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of Kukluxklan.
No one has ever been tried for murder.
"It's a wonder that in all these years, not one person has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even if we know their identity," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It's a stain on our history and the burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights fighter.
In his eyes the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call for action. Every year, Monroe reminds the community that justice was not done.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but above all justice," said Brooks.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner covers one of the bodies of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files that received NBC News coverage, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were to participate in lynching.
But no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights supporters claim that the two reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, by decision of the Supreme Court, the people of the state of Georgia acquired the right to participate for the first time in the elections planned for the summer.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, a black farmer named Roger Malcom was supposed to stab the owner of Barnett Hester's white-skin land during a fight - allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, Brooks said that Hester and Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, had a history of getting her pregnant.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent owner of white-skinned land, posted $600 for Malcoma bail.
Dorothy and his cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
When they returned from the prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, Harrison planned and organized the murders," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement who have not only participated in lynching but also disposed of evidence and withheld the identity of witnesses."
Brooks made a more brief statement on the matter.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all local black people: "this is what happens if you register and go vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event has been organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly ten years.
Her performance is figurative, captivating and apt, showing deep-rooted racism that many would like to view as extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy, and it is even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it has a purpose.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us if you don't hear what I've been through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and on the first day approximately 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of them blacks - were thrown into the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as assistant director.
For many years, the leader of Kukluxklan has played, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this because it contradicts who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time."
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon's actors, who play the role of Roger Malcom, often Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcom is arguing with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n--e!"
Rascona can't be done.
There's been a struggle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
"What happened?" he asks Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene responds cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people said "n-r" in that tone back then."
"Exactly," one of the black actors blurts out.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be done for enough four victims of the massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct expression of the word on N.
Nobody's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of actors and sings Billie Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit."
With every word in it, there's sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, about a dozen observers wipe the sweat and tears out of their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple arrived all the way from New York Ithaca, many of the bystanders from nearby.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in the crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders could have been looked at with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunted.
With the last words of the song, Greene will call on the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Kids kneel to the victim's heads, watch fake blood and motionless bodies, whispering something in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy pulls.
It's gonna be a few minutes, and Greene's gonna thank the audience.
Actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actor-friends and cries in their arms; in the end, emotions affect him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispering.
"We know you hate the part.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience will meet with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is interested in talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her feelings about tonight's performance.
"It's hard to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous acts... by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still an up-to-date topic," she added, "just called police fights."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in a courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he's already started planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study their country's history are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says only a coward reads instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything were rather a rare phenomenon.
So, for example, my first gramophone contained only one paper with hieroglyphics showing some parts on it, and there were some secret markings on all of them.
After years, when something went wrong inside, I offered the charter to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a grin, he told me what the labyrinth paper was suitable for.
Yes, it was a accustomed tool for chronic toilet paper depletion.
Playfully found the wire open and allowed me to listen again to expensive vinyl tortillas.
New times brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where it simply stuck to the cut grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
A sketch with a description of how to insert one piece into another was particularly good.
The set was two parts and another procedure was simply not possible.
Putting it in reverse required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-move.
The year of production 2003 still had a small book with manuals for minor repairs, including the exchange of a flashbulb.
It was easy.
Three steps in total, and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions failed to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Take out the shelter.
2. Unscrew the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3. Slide the cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem in the form of placing the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the upper right limb into the bowels of the car, I would grab a spring, a screw, which would easily remove the cover, and then I would follow points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
It's a mistake.
The shelter had no room, no space for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life without any success whatsoever.
The condition was enhanced by the entry of my wife into the garage, which he called out and the words that he heard from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked clumsyly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss vulgar terms, there were only two words left to publish.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why are you taking so long?" she risked a sentence that might be her last in a long-term union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the Tortura of the author of the instructions, where the blessing of the hot iron on the hand that wrote the instructions, then by the escape of it, so that he could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to a wide range of instructions of the Hammer of the Witch, including its commissional burning on the top of the Losinsky Castle.
"How about removing the box?" the woman meant removing the battery.
In pure desperation it happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming through from a collapse post-control of two officials of the State Department of Drug Control.
I know him as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field and who can tell wild stories with an unexcited voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having my handwashing instructions posted," he said in a weak voice.
I gradually pulled the whole problem out of him, which was that he didn't have picture instructions on how to wash his hands over the sink in the patient's toilet.
His argument by the commission clerk that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that they don't need pictograms to handle the accustomed activity of decent people has no healing effect and costs him a lot of money.
"It's not easy," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinse of washed palms flowing through water is a primitive act at the level of a coromony that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
Then it must be said that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end is a joyful finding that you washed your hands exactly as the hosudar from SÚKL commands.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and preparing a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
On the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in the case of urination, due to certain differences between both sexes, there will be a need to put up instructions two.
The problem remains the pictograms, because creating the perfect procedure also means a precise drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage in the prude visitor's toilet, despite finally being able to learn that throughout his life he wiped the hole completely wrong.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce the dividend in an effort to revive trade
On Friday, the British Educational Group Pearson stated that it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
A further wave of redundancies, which, according to the CEO John Fallon's statement, will take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, is followed by a previous decision by the company to release 4000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of £300 million ($394 million) in May under the third cost reduction programme in an attempt to resurrect declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in the Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month, stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital city of Afghanistan, Kabul. In the attack one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, reported official officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, reported in NATO's statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in an attack in Qarabagh County.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bombing - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in the Herat Mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its comments that Tuesday's explosion occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device'.
The statement also states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are in the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is an important source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of which died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb placed in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban volunteered for the attack.
On May 31, more than 150 people were killed by a major explosion in the city centre, the most deadly militant attack in the country since US troops overthrowed the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US soldiers who should be helping military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks to which the schools in recent weeks trusted the public in the government, its regulation, and in particular President Ashraf Ghana's reputation.
In response to the action, EPA re-evaluated its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called off its decision to postpone the Obama Administration Act, which ordered states to reduce emissions, just one day after 15 states sued the Agency.
EPA announced its decision on the referral of the "Ozone Standards 2015' on Wednesday nights with the words that it was submitting an undertaking by the Agency to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with our public partners and we will hear their views," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in his statement.
In June, Pruitt announced EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen out of most democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed an action on Tuesday stating that EPA's conduct was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an attempt to kick economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have launched countermeasures by democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA states on its website that breathing ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnar got hit and blood flowed!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event at Czech conditions, where he hosted such prominent personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by no one other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, show yourself to the public and present your music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the newly appointed personalities.
Few already know that the recording of the music video, which took place in Russia, was not without problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubnar himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shot with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it didn't go without a real embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's soccer music video should suggest a slap strike.
At one point, however, he was struck so hard and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my nose immediately shed blood," Ladislav commented.
Colleagues and producers settled the situation on set that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not respond in time.
Luckily, the injury wasn't serious enough to affect the continuation of the next filming.
The mentioned music video of a young artist is now brought to you, and you can also record the scene with a blow.
The failed version of blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibility of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting boxing match in the lightweight, met for the first time at Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated Lightweight Champion of the World Boxing Council - came down to the lobby where he welcomed Lomachenka, the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory based on a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime game, both boxers made the list of the top five lightweight fighters.
Garcia pulled his right and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former penis-weight champion," Garcia adds.
"I had to gain weight to fight with Broner (67 kg), but I'm not that big.
I'm small on my 63 kilos.
I'd like to return to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko needs to gain weight again to get lightly... then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Why don't you make it happen for them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Box would be good for this game."
Klimas made a request for a viewing payment - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should complete his debut in lightweight at the end of this year and next year compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also expressed an interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title in the Forum arena on September 23.
"The game should take place in the style of the viewing payment, that is what fans demand," said Garcia, who later said that the possibility of broadcasting the match is open through a television station that comes with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw that kind of attention to themselves.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenka as "a wonderful boxer" and could attend his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko wasn't allowed to lull with Garcia's praise when he said that the champion of the three divisions of Riverside looked "very slow... sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt the tension rising in front of each other's duels.
"You won't forget this game.
No other game attracts so much attention.
And I will take great pleasure in the fire," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
They just found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was a large search for them, but no success.
And the police ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad ending to the whole story came.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the river Volga in the town of Cheboksara in Zuvas.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car have the police managed to identify a few.
The evidence survived a decade underwater, without them it would take the police much longer to find out the identity of the found.
A few were last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
So far, the diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Chebsar police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road along the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its termination.
Latest results of tests to establish the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results from the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people have been asked as over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤tsmedicinalverket) started to carry out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
As of today, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted a total of 2481 tests to investigate 6880 cases, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was considered to be over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the surveyed was "maybe over 18 years of age."
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewer was "maybe under 18 years of age."
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the questioned is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Contrary to last month, the statistics have been kept in a rut, and the numbers are very similar," he said for The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated at over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the requested person is 18 years of age or older'.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the surveyed stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
Critics were also given a medical method of determining the age, which includes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is also concerned with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age of puberty.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
In a sense, the assessment of biological age is very uncertain.
If we cannot determine age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise," Metro said.
Forensics Medical Agency's GÃ¶ransson defended the decision by saying: "In general, the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person interviewed is just below 18 years of age, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump, on a January phone call from Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country wouldn't pay for building a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that he would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This results from the transcripts of the talks published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the major promises in his last election campaign.
Right in the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after joining Trump Peju Nieta, Nieta nediplomatically reprimanded himself for critically building his plan to build a wall.
He described the South Neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump repeatedly said in an interview from January 27th and threatened to cut ties with the president of Mexico if he continues to make defiant statements.
They say funding will work itself out, and it will end well.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," Trump said.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it may be the most important thing.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a wall of 3200 kilometers, which is why relations between the two countries have escalated.
At the end of March, Trump said the project will be valid for the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull of January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
To that end, he was prompted by an exchange of views on an agreement whereby Australia would provide asylum for Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to receive persons from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but later he agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you made, but you will have to stick to it," Trump Turnbull said.
In some passages, a telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump appreciated Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation got heated.
"I hate receiving these people," Trump remarked.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for local milkers," he said.
In an interview, he also noted that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with many world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, often several during one day.
In the end, he called the call with Turnbull the least pleasant one for the whole day.
Before ending it, he pointed out that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father was watching, too.
The execution took place in the square in Yemen Sana, the capital.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his victim the tiny Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped a girl, took her to his father's house where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl hit the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd who met to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under the right of Sharia.
The victim's father told the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Other members of the family were present, shouting the motto "let righteousness live " along with the crowd.
A rapist in the square brought in a police van that he was dragged out of.
The cops tied him up on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his weapon against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia's law have won," he added.
I stood in Sana Liberation Square waiting for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamile and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, the killer would grab and lynch.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shia Húti.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 whip wounds after his arrest, but his actions aroused such outrage that the judge decided to take the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27th.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that were borne by Rana's body were terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, the posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a horrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held and demand immediate punishment.
Deputy Justice has read to the crowd in attendance a record of the investigation to calm them down.
Apparently, the accused didn't show remorse for his actions.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read him the verdict, but the convicted man only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were a lot of footage from the crowd on the Internet.
The Governor of West Virginia announced a change of political party
President Trump's Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday night that he was going to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats turned their backs on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce to you... today as a resident of West Virginia, I tell you that I can no longer support you as democratic governor."
A crowd of viewers exploded in joy.
"I will apply to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes magazine, is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited great property from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The defection of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party that is putting obstacles in our way, instead of making it up to our country. "
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by the Governor of Justice is the last drop for a already so miserable party without a leader who is in vain to find a positive and unifying report," said President RNC Ronna McDaniel in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "honest" apology for a doping scandal
On Thursday, former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe commended Russia for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated once again that it was not the right time to return Russia to the sports world.
The head of Russian athleticist Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of MS in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who in this way lost gold and silver medals. "
Despite his comments, IAAF members voted to maintain the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we have seen a very honest answer and presentation today," said President Sebastian Coe to journalists.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and was working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the Federation."
Coe said that he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have advanced to the next stage, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff on the preservation of the sentence that was imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort was always to separate honest athletes from the dishonest ones," he ended his speech.
At the World Championship, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have fulfilled the strict rules of the IAAF.
The head of the crisis staff of IAAF Rune Andersen on Monday said that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
Drug tests are still unsatisfactory and the excluded coaches continue to operate, told reporters in London after the IAAF presentation.
The CzechTrade public contract was won by the company František Savov, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state export agency CzechTrade was awarded by the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savova.
Officials awarded him a hundred percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and asked for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Trade's Proexport Agency issued a four-year public procurement for the BusinessInfo portal.
A contract worth CZK 30.8 million was awarded by the publishing house Mladá fronta entrepreneur František Savova.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov has fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
News server Aktuálně.cz pointed to the case.
According to the original criteria CzechTrade was to decide the price offered and the remaining 40 beauty competition, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion helped Savov's company significantly.
According to information Dotýk.cz received 100 points in all sub-quality criteria.
This is what moved her in front of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with CZK 404 900 a month, VLM offered CZK 324 350.
Unlike the Mladá fronta, however, it received a total of 62 points from assessors in all qualitative criteria.
Tendru was also attended by the consultant company BDO Advisory and digital agency R-Media, which falls as the news server Aktuálně.cz under the publishing house Economia.
VLM publishing has raised several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its assessment as unfair and inadequately justified.
Following their rejection, it decided to challenge competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the ÚOHS.
He believes that CzechTrade has acted against the law.
"The applicant believes that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a supplier of a public contract on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favoring participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," says the proposal for the opening of proceedings at the ÚOHS this week, which published the server News.
According to the Director General and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an unbelievable and 100% assessment of the Mladá fronta project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Each independent observer must consider such a miraculous success as unlikely and suspicious by one of the competitors," Klima said for News.
The CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, the CzechTrade Agency does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in the Contracting Authority's Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin in accordance with the law.
"A full written report will be published after the contract has been concluded, but we cannot comment on the contract's progress," Štěpán Dlouhý told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that Economia had intervened in an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in that Article.
The fact that she provided the BusinessInfo portal with editorial services in the previous four years may have helped her in the tender.
The contract was first competed in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive deductions of VAT of his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage to up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to publish it since 2014.
According to Savov, he is responsible for his criminalization by the head of the ANO movement Andrej Babiš, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house falls.
Last year, the London court dismissed Savov's appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK regarding the acquisition of legal power," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Mladá fronta, Savov appeared in the company Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Czech Budějovice brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
He should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker was on the sidewalks and the park, and he ended up in the twirls.
The biker attracted attention to himself with a reckless ride on the streets, pavements and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to take her in the direction of the Station.
"The officers of the man were cautiously persecuted by the city when he failed to control one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," said police spokesperson Daniel Dvořák.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive in the accident, which transported the injured biker to Pilsen Hospital.
After that, the police found out that the biker did not own a driving licence, the registration marks on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number sharpened and the production label itself removed.
It's so possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test carried out was ruled out on the spot by the presence of alcohol in the driver, but a positive result was found on the methamphetamine substance," said the police spokesperson.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymara's transfer to Paris
Rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's record transfer from Spain to Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions a year.
The following are a number of financial terms for Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymara into a already star soccer family.
Clubs may spend huge amounts on the purchase of players, but on the other hand they must demonstrate legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini to the chair of the director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheated and risked bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP's rules redirected its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich and Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and to spend the aggregate sums on players to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
For the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may report losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini's having to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Cheferin is committed to defending the ban on excessive spending.
"FFP rules still apply and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," said Andrea Traverso, an Associated Press last week, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the redemption of Neymara in a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, extend the amount to the full duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down into EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in 2014-2015, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is careful of teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Therefore, although the Qatarian company sponsors PSG as soon as financing exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymara's income in PSG could be paid from the World Cup of Football 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSG and the representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar denied the fat that Neymat should become an ambassador of the World Championship in football and that such a maneuver would easily be revealed by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's UEFA insiders, Neymara's transfer to PSG did not initiate any investigation.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous as it was not entitled to comment on the PSG situation, reported The Associated Press.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed EUR 10 million in 2015-2016 with a net profit and a turnover of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
The Spanish league officials, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate the rules of the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping' to both the club and the state," said President La Liga Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La League's position on club financing.
"It is the result of ownership that has changed the football world from the ground up in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as the club owner becomes the club owner, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state can have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan Reserver Rosicky: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applause fans on their feet.
Tomas Rosicky's on the set.
Same scene as the Bohemians' Sunday game.
Spartan backup man moved the game against Crvené Zvezda, invented several goals, but his teammates did not go black.
The flight team pumped with new multi-million-dollar reinforcements ends after the opening double-game in European cups.
Was it hard to do anything else with the fight after Belgrade's goal?
After the scored goal, four had to be scored, which was hard for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, raise our self-esteem, so we had something to bounce off into the next games.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why couldn't Sparta make it to the game for so long?
The game is very sophisticated.
The combination of the opponents was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we fired at halftime, like, once.
Of course, that's awfully small when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final period.
But you have to push your opponents into those positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains of creating a new team.
We only played three competition matches and the lineup keeps changing.
The point is that Coach finds an ideal 11 that sits down.
Is it encouraging that you have already played parts of two games in a row?
They're still just parts of the game.
I don't know how my condition is going to turn out and when I can finally play from the start.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that took place in Sparta?
We have to be. There's no other way.
It's the same as with the wound.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will get worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show off something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember visiting like this when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, a businessman is supposed to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of Jiří Toman, who is supposed to serve ten years in prison for tax cuts to a large extent.
The estimated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
In his complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary violated his fundamental rights, the facts of the Zlín and Olomouc courts are said to be incomplete.
The Constitutional Judges, however, called the complaint unfounded, found the Czech News Agency from the database of the court.
The U.S. is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess factual or legal misconduct alleged to have been committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a breach of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision of the U.S.
The penalty imposed is at the top of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage suffered.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis between 2005 and 2008.
The damage to CZK 645 million was created only during the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage according to the expert exceeded a billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise taxes, at least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded have a relationship with businessman Radomir Vybíra, whom the justice system measured for VAT-taxing in fuel stores for 13 years in prison.
He also rejected his complaint before the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer for Survival" and "Comrade Detective" play on the nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both characters from the famous 1980s; so for the dirty 1990s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, namely 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd broke into larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
But from a franchise point of view, someone seems to be running out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The continuation of the Year's Later, in which adults play adults do not push so much on the emotional plane and satire is sometimes sporadic, including the parody of thrillers from the 1990s as "Hand on the Cradle."
At one point, the figure finds Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991" on a pile of junk.
Many main story lines repeat themselves.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't moved over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), motivated by George H. W. Bush (a very well occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of franchise.
Especially funny is watching an eternal young Rudd with long hair, aka Matt Dillon character from Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now an old pepper.
Franchise could start moments of random madness, such as the returnee of the Seven Up series, until it achieves what I suppose will be a logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the whole group will go to the premiere of "Summer to Survive."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to a different type of nostalgia: Cold War Revivalism series "Such normal Americans," movie "Atomic Blonde: No regrets" and even "GLOW" series, where icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes meet.
The comedy of the creators of Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak directed by Rhys Thomas is to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s fighting for the truth and atheism after the Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, which were dubbed into the English language by Channing Tatum (the executive producer of the series) and by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as police watching chess on TV - American football parody).
Many famous actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - gave their voice to the series.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - including the Reagan mask killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long and comedy moments aren't enough.
With shorter footage, propaganda satires in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in whose hall two fat people devour hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message for the imaginary Communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The fiction of Romanian creators was not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
The Russian athletes did not receive the cancellation of the launch ban from the IAAF.
The International Athletic Federation of IAAF at the Congress in London confirmed the extension of the international ban on starting Russian competitors due to the state-supported doping program.
The vote in the event of the World Championship, which will start on Friday, was expected to be very clear.
166 delegates spoke out for the extension of the ban, with only 21 votes against it.
The main reason for the rejection is in particular the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated by the head of the IAAF Rune Andersen Special Investigation Group before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been heard and coaches with a bruised reputation are still working in the country.
Russia's RUSADA Anti-Doping Agency, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies, RUSADA can already carry out testing.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said Chairman of IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so the Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming MS, who have already proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
But they won't be able to start at the championship in national colors, and if they win, they won't be able to play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will hold the interest rate at 0,25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a slight economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has smothered speculation about sharp growth.
England's bank warned that economic growth would continue to be "in the background" in connection with keeping the interest rate - despite family budgets.
The politicians of the Committee on Monetary Policy (MPC) England's banks voted six to two to maintain the interest rate at 0,25%. The results of the vote for the interest rate increase supported the low economic growth supported by the weak increase.
In its Annual Inflation Report, the Bank predicted growth to be 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that over the next few years there should be growth as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that property rent should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the term-financing plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should apply from next February, although the Bank of England has stated that it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: "MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term together with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption'.
On the subject of rates, the bank stated that it would be necessary to "stress the money policy belts" to calm inflation, "to a higher degree" than the markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the next increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "limited."
The bank reduced the growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The expected growth in 2018 was 1,8% unchanged.
After publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound has fallen by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried hope for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0,2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year, according to the bank's statement, it should increase slightly.
The latest inflation report is a minor consolation for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases.
The report further states that monetary policy "can't prevent' income cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "highly' towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also increase due to the great interest in British goods thanks to a weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after the rates were reduced to 0,025% in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the full integration of prices and economies will last at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households. Three political officials demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June 2.9%, despite the fact that the bank indicated that it had expected such a change and inflation would rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excesses relative to the 2% target were "total' as a result of a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent fall in swap rates, competition on the mortgage market seems to only rise once creditors begin to compete for contracts with a view to a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and mortgages - there are options in the offer without fees, as well as low rates that they like."
NHS will prescribe a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 patients
Since September, patients will receive access to "transformative' treatment for HIV prevention by decision of the Supreme Court on funding NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through medical services to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the probationary period after the appeal court supported the Supreme Court's decision last year, stating that the NHS had funds to pay the Prep despite the declaration that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as "a major intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as "the decisive moment'.
Clinics of sexual health in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 full implementation will take place throughout England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV drug used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among patients at risk.
Prep before sex means that there are enough specific medicines in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also apply in their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers at £10 million and NHS England signed this week's drug distribution contract after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PREP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: "This important intervention should complement and fully burden ever-increasing and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PREP is administered correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection with a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement.'
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure its availability to every patient.
We now have a PrEP trial drug available and are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the Prep trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Follow-up tests will bring us one step closer to full understanding of Prep's benefits.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible across the country to protect those exposed to HIV and thus jointly end the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on high feet: Mezzanine and smart design have turned this small apartment into a spacious home at Earls Court
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded a big house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment at Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is a demonstration of modern design, which makes use of the maximum available space.
"I lived with my ex-husband earlier in a much bigger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment at Earls Court, and it was the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him immediately, and on the same day I nodded to him."
Since then, the apartment with a size of 1000 square meters has been completely renovated.
One-room apartment with complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
"I longed for high ceilings, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
For this purpose, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used an almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach enough height to accommodate two gaps - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine that could be walked upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform but at the same time bending the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to construct two full rooms on himself - and at the same time add to the drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and jars.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment an impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The tilting kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says about reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is equipped with counterweights to move away very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained another 16 square meters, second room and better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is the living space - or appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
"The real estate broker essentially calculates its price on the basis of the residential area when entering the apartment."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space while maintaining quality materials that lend space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
"You won't love power lines in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts will not gain."
As it turns out, quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, eventually you can decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee paid her back and declared a retaliation ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, US citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.
The point is that California has banned the spending of state money on the travel of its citizens to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT, and any manifestation of disagreement with LGBT's lifestyle is considered discrimination.
Tennessee, however, adopted a law on reservation of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with therapy of patients in the LGBT community has no obligation to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide such patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
In turn, Texas and other states have adopted laws that say that religious charitable organizations who have received children from mothers for adoption after birth are not obliged to provide identical sex couples for adoption.
Because of these laws on the reservation of the conscience of California, California has banned funding its citizens' travels to eight states of the Union from its means.
In practice, this means that Californian professors are not allowed to travel to scientific symposiums, for example, in Texas, paid for by their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
But it is absurd for the federal government to finance citizens' travels from State A to State B or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and his parliament has adopted a law with a resolution that he does not like California's high-tax policy, high-state spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California because of that.
He's putting them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's facts, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws of reservation of conscience as well as to decide what their money is and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what is wrong with reservation of conscience?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why couldn't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes with hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all Federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policy in powers that are not federal, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California could be California, and Texas could be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and let them live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not to be tolerant of themselves and others, but extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one must ever show moral, religious, or philosophical opposition to LGBT's lifestyle again, and if they do so, they are to be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in American history where states have done this kind of thing on political grounds, except in the case of one thing.
Even during the struggle for the civil rights of black people, where North and West were on the integration side and South on the segregation side, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery, and the North War against the South was about to happen.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the states of the blue democratic and the states of the red republican grows deeper, and the US is mentally divided.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critics Putin got a greasy ticket.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalnyy received a fine of 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court fined him for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny organized two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wanted to apply for the post of head of state in March next year.
The reigning head of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but it is generally expected that he will do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to the courthouse.
He fined him for challenging people for demonstrations through videos placed on the YouTube website.
The fine is 300 grand.
"Later we'll take them off the judge's salary," the critic of the Kremlin joked on Twitter.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the judgment politically motivated.
Fines of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday by two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny joined Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
Authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to five-year probation because of the fact that he robbed Kirovles.
In May, the verdict was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so final, which prevents the Naval one from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are pulling over one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in Toorak estate, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who drove the dispute over joint assets and assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a heated dispute is constantly being held before the Supreme Court.
Along with his mother Anna, he and his brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 at Smith Street, Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded Westco Jeans, which has grown into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
For money, additional properties and portfolio of the De Lutis family now include offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul's words, is "a major driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
Court records say Colin owns $ 316 million worth of real estate while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
For Paul, the division of assets and funds became the problem.
"Colin's proposal came out in my eyes significantly in his favor," Paul wrote in a sworn statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first Supreme Court meeting was held.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, Colin cut off.
Colin contradicts that this is not true and blames Paul for mistreatment of some real estate.
In the previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that family is the most important thing," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QCs and defense attorneys on both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a real estate in Collingwood for money, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little, about a 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family's group of companies. Colin said that Mark was compensated for $10 million in his departure, and Luke $26 million in dollars.
As Paul, Luke, and Mark said, "they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation. "
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of AFL, as stated in his autobiography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied by means of a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled before the court, "I have nothing to add to it."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to deal with the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin stated in one of the statements in court that he was trying to adapt to his brother's requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation," he said, adding that "he still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hopes were out of sight.
"Our disputes will be resolved shortly," Colin wrote.
Hot in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower kids.
Drivers of public transport fake water and summer clothes.
At Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now arriving, she only goes out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a great shadow.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower the kids in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children remain in classes where blinds and curtains are closed.
The air is trying to cool off with an air cleaner because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also hard for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the sanitary limits for kindergarten schools, so we should not even have open operation during this period," said the school principal Miloslava Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in kindergarten where she thinks the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We'll air out in the morning after 6:00 p.m., close the windows, and we've got the south side of the blinds we're protecting ourselves with.
"But it doesn't help much," she said.
They have better conditions in the forest kindergarten at Hráz in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nut, there is a table under it, and we do things there," said Barbora Kompanová, headmistress of kindergarten.
Teachers and children try to walk in the woods, where there is more coolness.
Children wet hats and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a manual pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," said Kompanová.
The headmistress of kindergarten in Novoborská street in Prague Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers try to keep their children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a relatively large garden, so they are under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning, and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or a diluted juice and have a drink with water in the garden.
They also eat vegetable salad every day and always have fresh fruit and vegetables for snacks, sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Perhaps today, a mother brought about a ten-pound watermelon for children," Makovičková added.
Drivers get water or summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
Both tram and bus cabs are air-conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková.
Apart from cabins, some trams are air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks haven't really damaged yet.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivar.
At current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have sufficient drinks at their disposal.
"Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and roadways," said Řehková.
In roads and in some alternate places, employees have so called sodobars, which produce a chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," she said.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic destroyed 108, twice the long-term average.
On Tuesday, during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly employed firefighters.
"Fires in the natural environment prevail, as well as those associated with harvest work," said Nicole Zaoralová, spokesperson for firefighters.
Even the evening weather changes did not bring relief to the firefighters, when storms and torrential rainfall took place in a number of places.
In connection with the storms, the firefighters set off for 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"The most intervened in the Central Bohemia Region," continues Zaoralová.
The help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolinky, Českolipsko, where 60 people from the children's camp evacuated to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added work to Prague's paramedics.
On Tuesdays and nights on Wednesdays, ambulances drove up to ten cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from karate.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warning the paramedics.
Carbon monoxide is a odourless, colourless gas released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, the infected room should be abandoned.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media diet
Many tried before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politicalo said that the new chief of staff at the White House plans to reduce the flow of information from President Trump - including news coverage - in the news - in the hopes of keeping Trump on the surface.
Here's part of Reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
"When the new chief of staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met on the first day of his new office with the employees, outlined the key problem of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: incorrect information that comes into the President's hands.
Kelly announced to his employees that he had to personally approve all information - whether on paper or a word of speech - because the president could make a better decision based on the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth at Trump's checkpoint and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump was upset as a candidate by honest reports, it was convenient to show him that many other media were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince," he said in February for Politicalo Sam Nunberg, a former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets at bay - at least according to the words of six former campaign organisers - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that sing praise to him. "
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn't check them.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from instigating controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by moving materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the inclination of advisors to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
"The current and former Trump officials say that the president often responds very angryly to negative news from the media, especially news of leaks, and seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - a website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source of many leaks of information' from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever banished from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not submit any evidence of his claim; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later called them off.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff Reince Priebus and secretary of the White House Rob Porter "tryed to implement the system to manage and document the information that President Trump would receive".
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push through the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just disappear, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These constant factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate a trench and return to "The Millionaire Quarter"
Several of the most vibrant homeowners in West Midland, England, are once again plotting with determined tourists who negotiate with local authorities about the rights to reclaim the fields for their settlements.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a thriving street in Solihull, called the "millionaire neighborhood. "
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. They did not even frighten the ditch, which was dug on site by order of authorities in order to prevent their incursion.
Tactical group found the gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected by the gap that served the journey.
The rabid residents of the neighborhood attacked the board of directors of Solihull with the fact that "he is unable to solve the problem'.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said: "They took up the post on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board of directors should be ashamed of their inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to a different location and now they're back.
There was another one last night, and there's probably more coming today.'
She added: "The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't intend to pay my taxes until the board of directors deals with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: "It's ridiculous. We were just watching the last tourists leaving and now they're back.
And this time there are more of them and this time they brought their horses with them.'
A spokesperson for the board of directors of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem successfully.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents report any non-social or unlawful behaviour to the police on number 101.
We'll get the full picture we'll present in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special delivered the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
At the airport there were two ambulances waiting and on board the plane was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went uncomplicated.
Róbert Žitňanský reported that TV JOJ had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of summer.
He said he was hit by a car, and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After transport to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of Bratislava's hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.
Couple of them have three kids together.
Italians are strengthening the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving on the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean Sea unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said the Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after Italian authorities confiscated the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet due to suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization refused to comment on the matter on the charges of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us it is and will always be the number one priority to save lives. We are very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at the moment," the organization said in the social media statement.
"We can only comment on all current charges after the gathering of all information and the assessment of the situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking the Jugend Rettet ship Iuventa since October.
Her crew is suspicious that she was transporting immigrants on the ship, which were handed over directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
According to the plaintiff's file, at least one meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - humanitarian enthusiasm rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
On Thursday, the latter stated that the new rules were not necessary, but acceptable, since they did not constitute any "essential change or obstacle' as regards rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct was rejected by the Organisation of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
Meanwhile, Minniti has been told that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks, which have landed in Italy as part of rescue operations, suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
"We are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel in the last few days," said the Minister.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations to take place this month with the Mayors of Libya on the topic of the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
She had silicone and cellulite coming out of her overall!
Hot summer days are tempting to wear only the most necessary things that cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaroš does it the other way around.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and everyone who had to do with TV Prima were just crawling, their body covered in mini overal.
And all it took was a few routine moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
Overal cut himself between her butt cheeks many times, and she got so high up, she had to fix it all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and photographers present was certainly not needed.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages encouraging Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusets was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
20-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of two years in prison and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday: "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was in danger for up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in a place of judgment with tears in her eyes, her hands tight and her eyes facing the ground.
"Its actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
However, Carter's attorney said that these were "unhappy circumstances that she deeply regrets. "
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder has no significant impact on her conduct ".
The applicant read Roy's mother's statement to Lynn Roy: "It won't take a day for me to grieve for the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," said the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was being "hunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be an aunt of his children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I carry with me for life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law to prosecute a person assisting in the suicide of another person.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat poisoned with carbon dioxide in 2014.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published, inciting suicide.
"I don't care if you're hanging yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself," said the text messages that Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just need to get the generator back on and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from commenting in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who took Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prison. "
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just the day before the announcement of the Audi car manufacturer BMW said that it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350 000 vehicles.
President BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the headquarters of the BMW - are considering bans or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide released by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, car manufacturers' costs of installing diesel engines are being increased, making it more difficult to compete with cars.
While German car manufacturers face careful tours, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful automobile companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which, in an effort to meet emission limits, installed software in their cars, which reduced emissions during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine development department would be arrested in Germany.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he can face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi engaged in a criminal investigation by the German police on Volkswagen after the authorities accused the Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emission limits - and thus extended the charges that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of the Audi car manufacturer in the investigation may have an unfortunate impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers account for an disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane crashed into the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the Witnesses told SIC Noticias that the plane flew just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people reportedly fled from the beach from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
According to local media, a 50 - year - old man and an 8 - year - old girl died on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on site," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them got out of the accident alive, and the cops took them in for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the motorways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it started to be built in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the Hradec highway D11.
The construction of the next section of it for at least a few months has stopped the Children of Earth movement.
We East Boys get highways in pieces, like they cut salami.
They'll take the wheel and then we'll see when and if we'll ever get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless streams of trucks go directly through the city of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not reasonable to go around.
But so far the last stretch of our dream highway was operational in 2008, i.e. nine incredible years ago.
I haven't heard from you since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradec Králové started to be built recently and on the other sections to Jaroměř started with an archaeological survey that started at the end of this year, you could hear loud banging of corks in Eastern Bohemia.
Nobody believed that anymore.
Last week, it turns out he's not gonna build this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement of the Children of the Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brno has given a breakdown.
The children of Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
They request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Hradec Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far we are driving from D11 near the village with the eloquent name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and then we're standing on the side road, and we prefer to get into the column after that.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Funeral Room.
What do the Children of Earth demand?
What is the nature of communication problems in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually inexhaustible in the current system?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the area of southeastern France, but now they are at risk of climate change.
Lavender is dwindling as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, causing horror on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavendering in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
The cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which thrive in the dry climate, are also to blame."
There's a lot at stake.
The lavender attracts tourists and the oil they make is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "The place of long and beautiful flowers grows smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
Of course, the amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is smaller."
A more efficient distribution of water and slowing down the vaporization of water from the soil can be a possible solution, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the news of the riots that are taking place in the Sinai area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and unstoppable drug wars.
Today, however, it is mainly for its own safety that brings together under the grip of recent events.
They learn that it is important for them to change their customs.
Two worthy journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked by a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and premonition.
Selecting them from what - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists are suspected of taking money from governments or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job is to cover criminal acts.
Violence does not cease, and the bodies are piled up across the country; journalists are constantly growing among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them have been in power since President Enrique Pen Niet in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven were killed in all seven states this year.
Among them also co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is palpable, although his presence is all-pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice" that shows the middle finger hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, two suspects have been sued by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists so far.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime, so journalists' murderers are very rarely brought to trial.
Riodoca journalists insist on informing them of the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated by grief and the territory is now very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, a safety meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoca in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelveth River.
The shooters then boarded his vehicle and crashed it not far from the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
The rumors seem to travel fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as the rival factions try to fill an empty space.
Each day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi and the cemetery is full of jewelled two - story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "silence" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that go to the United States of drugs.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce still accuses himself of not protecting his friend.
He believes that two misdeeds contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with Joaquín Guzman's sons.
The peace could make the sons angry; the suspected gang members bought all copies of the papers when they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the fight against journalists by Mexican criminals.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In Noroeste's periodical, he was practically a veteran when he decided to sell his shares worth $50 in 2003 and set up together with five fellow Riodoca.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning drug trafficking, " said Bojorquez.
In time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for a Latin American report.
That same year, Valdez won the award of the International Freedom of the Press of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when he received the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is "a way of life," said Valdez last October in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the role of journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his everyday routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you mess with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "scent is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules according to him, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - just as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
Landscapes change all the time.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce's employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered that governments bought to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief before the 40-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoca, which are located in a four-story building in the Culiacan quarter of the city.
Journalists are teasing if these cops aren't one of those 50 percent of the law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It's been a few months since journalists last set foot in mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also have a light on suspicious government spending in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently, several kidnappings have also taken place at one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the abduction, so the journalists were on guard when they were going to write about what every city citizen knows: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist has read from the public record that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the previous incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of Joaquín's sons "El Chapo" Guzman escaped the army's task force.
A month ago, readers would have read about this in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal (46), who is known as "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has turned into a warehouse of signs and labels to protest the killing of journalists, and the employees certainly didn't expect them to become press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a burned body was discovered, and the authorities say it's Adame based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country. Many of them organize protests and scribble on the pavements and buildings of the "SOS press."
The director of the Bojorquez newspaper is a day on a visit to Washington, where he seeks international support and justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who took place the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and their murders for proclaiming the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might endanger her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "rounded" by organized crime, corrupt officials, and indifferent public.
In his latest book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the orders of politicians and security forces working with organized crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused more than half of all attacks on journalists of police officers and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
Apparently, murders work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
There was a keyboard and headphones next to the severed head.
Some branches have decided to cease their activities, such as the newspaper El Norte, located near the northern borders of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of the rapporteur, Miroslava Breach.
The others are still going on, just like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels publicly by an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us? "
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, as well as to get rid of the feeling that you are constantly being persecuted.
And journalists are being hunted and killed, such as Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruze.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, it poses a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexiko is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight, and Riodoce's employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly rings.
They learn that 19 people died in a gunfight between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area were promised by members of the syndicate.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headlines change again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shooting.
Bojorquez is giving a glimpse of the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the whole of Sinaloa - all the employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How could we even think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to put her on the street?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first sight, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first findings of the amazing rhino size creation, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called "Mona Lisa dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts could identify the red-brown color of his scaly skin and reported that the dinosaur had a "problematic past'.
An article in Current Biology said that it is "the most preserved armoured dinosaur found so far and one of the world's finest dinosaurs. "
The fossil is a new species of the Nodosauridae family. Dinosaurus lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described him with the words "really remarkable'.
According to National Geographic, the armored white eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk is behind the discovery, which revealed fossils on March 21, 2011 during drilling in Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to unveil an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
"Just squint your eyes a little and believe he's sleeping,' said Caleb Brown's supervisor and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the animal is exposed.
"It will certainly be written into history as one of the most beautiful and decoydant species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
By studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank - was most likely faced with a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
A heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many of today's animals.
Experts claim that it enabled him to blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was a popular food for larger dinosaurs.
Reports of 110 million years old dinosaur families Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May. Currently available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully uncovering fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered the method of camouflage commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this cloaking effect is common in nature, researchers' findings are surprising because the Borealopelta size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
So it is possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred camouflage over confrontation to survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - e.g. deer, zebra, or armadillo - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its surviving.
"The preparation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the Cretaceous period," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skin was probably reddish-brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and look for further insight into his life, including his well - preserved stomach contents, to track down his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was taken to the sea where it sank to the bottom.
At that time in the Alberta region, the same climate as in today's Florida and the rivers and oceans were farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,' said Brown.
"For these reasons the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just turn your eyes a little bit and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the Cretaceous period, giant therapists, carnivorous dinosaurs, walked the Earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite prey of his equally terrifying ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 meter long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology believe that the body of Borealopelt was washed up into the sea after being mummified in the mud.
Shawn Funk is behind the discovery, which revealed fossils on March 21, 2011 during drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from nose to hip.
The animal was 5 metres long in diameter and weighed up to 1300 kg.
His shoulders stood out two inches [50 cm] of thorns.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of Canada today until he ended up in the river that washed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, "Finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking the find.
Fossil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right foreleg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets? '
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native from St. Louis sat on a bed in Airbnb's room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
In doing so, she came across a contribution from a high school student.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah kept retweeting her wall posts.
Rapper of St. Louis posted his contributions on Twitter about Michael Brown's death, an unarmed 18-year-old young man shot by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body, lying in no way on the street, from where no one took him even after four hours.
"That's crazy," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down to go back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign saying "Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched live news - one of the cops stood before a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand, and at the other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, as she said, was holding a gun pointed at the crowd and screaming, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," said Ferrell.
"This isn't the kind of murder we're used to and we can call normal.
I felt goosebumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She booked a return flight immediately and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson during the next three years describes the new documentary "Whose Streets?" which will be introduced to the cinemas on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and inevitability told from the perspective of people living in a community who are on the streets demanding answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in floral dryness and the same floral headband - about a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience with black people."
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" recalls the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old young man and that's not right."
"It was not an option that I would take her with me," Ferrellová said later.
"Today's events are the climax of the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but it also had to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we have to do to free ourselves.
Even though I'm able to provide her with conditions in which she doesn't experience racism, she's no different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I could protect her from this experience, I would only harm her."
Upon arriving in Ferguson, South Florissant Road was the first stop across the street from the police department, which became the base of activists expecting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped deliver it to Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to emerge.
"My activism turned upside down after 9 August," said Ferrellová, adding that she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn association during her studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell became acquainted with a later co-director of the document, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought: "Do you work on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used? "
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unbridled conversation: "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were very often neglected, and we wanted to change that. "
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, a respected local artist who deals with the topic of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the project was also introduced by Ferrell and by six other local residents who were followed by the "Whose Streets" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement," said Davis.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrell - in an attempt to see that the movement "is not about a savior's leader, but about the convergence of the community," Folayan said - it was she who proved to be the most open to participation in filming.
The Whose Streets document describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrellová with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the preservation of the movement," said Ferrellová, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "in fact, the movement is supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women. "
He insists, however, that "this is not merely an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
"It was she who was the driving force and source of energy," she said.
"that she was the one who found herself in the front lines is no coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy rush in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, TV station cameras have cleared out their positions, but severe racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year probation for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
Socially political atmosphere in an area she calls home described as "The Mess."
Still, she hasn't stopped trying to commit herself to since she set off on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in Cologne.
There were dozens of firemen on the scene, a chopper helped.
Not far from Český Brod in Kolín, between the municipalities of Bylany and Liblice, a field of approximately 15 hectares burned from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 3:15, the firemen declared a third level fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighter spokesperson Ladislav Holomčík, fire from the air helped put out a helicopter.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to put out the fire, fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and voluntary firefighters fought with the flames on the ground.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the engine compartment of the combiner.
The fire was also helped by a helicopter that made a total of six drops of water.
"We handed over the place of intervention to the owner until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, the volunteer fire brigade will be guarding him," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of New York's New York's rooms, the Fridman Gallery is placed with several faces of different skin shades - white, black and dark - hanging from the ceiling on the wires, each of them as if the previous one had fallen out of the eye.
All 30 portraits were made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst serves a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cablegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which started on 2 August, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he left the US President.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and by using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a slim, if not intellectual commentary on DNA yield - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken since her youth about being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 charges, including the violation of six spy laws, computer fraud, and theft.
All her photos were held by the prison staff, and only one black and white photograph of a lower quality leaked to the public, to which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in a platinum blond wig, with which she is now associated.
In 2015, there were still positive responses to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
Visits and photos were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she was interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama asked for Manning's release a few days after the release of the comic book, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people who are seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to inspire hatred by their tweets in areas that he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "everything happens for a reason"
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in her last name is flown by the heart) after the end of "self-actionary factionism based on sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - Centipede letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biological, we all are.
"I hope that people will get away with this, that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their way," Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above-mentioned graphic novel.
He's showing Manning as King Kong emerges from United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never be silenced."
"It is a direct transcript of one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - which was predicted in a comic book - but when she does, she will be welcomed in the center of the room with her masks, her own genome portraits, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the almost 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"In the past they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to glow the feeling of the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor Northwest University and employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
These days, a nationwide search for Professor Northwest University and employees of Oxford University who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man found stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment has been conducted by the police.
On Monday, a warrant was issued for the first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports Cook County's court file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago Police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
Cops were notified of this by telephone. On arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on scene, and detectives are investigating a murder case.
Lathem worked as a lecturer of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is being investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
The University spokesperson and Somerville College stated in a statement sent by e-mail: "The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police as well. "
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and wishing him to apply to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations with the Chicago Police Department, stated that he was calling on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglily added that local, regional and national authorities assist the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglily stated that it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Lath and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza leadership has issued a statement for all residents: "The police are now working to compile the victim's timeline and profile and investigate various motives, including domestic violence. "
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-established Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A part of the criteria of the new plan has been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA's compliance plan - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the code does not contain anything that Russia should be concerned about.
"Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which Richard McLaren investigated, of the alleged sponsoring of doping by the government of Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutka's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview for Russian RSport Smirnov admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: "On many occasions we said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of taking doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to Moscow's headquarters in July, General Manager WADA Olivier Niggle stated that RUSADA is "on the right track" to renew its validity.
The police have accused three people, one of them is juvenile.
Police accused three men of setting up Wednesday's fire of a rare wooden church in Třinci-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místek.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationalities.
They are facing up to 15 years in prison for a felony of general danger.
Moravian-Silesian police director Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the matter," said Kužel.
He stated that the police would be discussing the possible arrest of the accused.
Further information, according to the Director, cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say more yet, because the staff of criminal police services and investigations and prosecutors who supervise the matter are actually working on things," said Kužel.
The wooden church of God's body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Material damage will be estimated at tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, other costs are prepared to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
It was caused by an electrical failure at the time.
In his place, an exact copy was made.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for associations used in defence of the state, voluntary shooting training or a team of training trainers, he envisages the substantive intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state.
The Ministry of Defence, which received its task from the government, promises that this will increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This results from the draft prepared by the Ministry.
If the law had been passed in the future, the state would have spent hundreds of millions of crowns in support of defence.
The basic aim of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech Republic's population to defend the state, outside the performance of the defence obligation and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the State would support the associations of radio amateurs, shooters, or cynologists financially or with material and would allow them to increase the capacity of their members.
In return, he would get data on people who are willing to come to the country during a crisis to help and their abilities or material equipment if necessary.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It is also intended to organise discussions with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be established in charge of administration and project coordination.
The authors of the proposal point out that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after the state of the threat is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wiping of previously obvious boundaries between the types of threats," the intention states, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministers noted that it is therefore necessary to concentrate on promoting as broad a set of capabilities as possible, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the project is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond to situations which threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself or, where appropriate, to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to carry out their tasks," he says.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
Their amount will depend according to the Ministry on the chosen option.
For example, the Authority envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million a year.
More money would go to salaries or to the construction of an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the regional military headquarters would have to expand, which would have employed 42 more soldiers together.
Representatives of the Ministry have already stated that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its acceptance would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons the directive forbids.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she didn't find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the entire process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the e-commerce company, Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New human resources startups are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intention of measuring employees' obligations, startups allow companies to vote quickly, target specific teams and demographic groups, and offer complete anonymity of employees and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass their superiors and contact the director directly.
"There are tools like Diet and Fitbit on the market that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint Startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that Glint has given her three years of greater awareness of what her employees think and feel.
In addition to quick surveys and specific team voting, Glint offers a company temperature map and a timely overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing users to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is torn up in scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a contribution describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global sector of control, regulation and compliance may exceed $11.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convert from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 of Convercent's clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently under his wings he also accepted Uber.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send customizable "flash" surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The court of public opinion has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convercent Startup.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not intervene - it can face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, employee exhaustion or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convert for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to track down a phone number or e-mail to the company management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Deputy General Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was previously no reliable way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convert, quick detection and resolution of problems that have previously never reached managers sitting in offices is ensured, miles away, from a real solution to complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It is close to the holistic, overall view of employees' experience," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from lawsuits by employees."
Companies stopped taking the ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed after Enron's fall on the abuse of employees' ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But only when "the social media shined on the whole thing " did society begin to realize that they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to monitor the ethics of technology, they relied on faith," Quinlan said.
Both Glint and Convert offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by courageous capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent collected total $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital as part of his February campaign, and finally took the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million from the Bessemer Venture Partners in November and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of researches clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to see that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a society that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits of LinkedIn, who uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors make money if companies and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the involvement and commitment of employees to the company, it is no wonder that there are many investors who support this effort.
According to professional culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company doesn't take the necessary steps.
The fact is that when a company applies for feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case scenario at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest in employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, Director of Counseling at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that relied too much on the data itself.
"Because once things aren't over, the employees start asking themselves, "Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should it interest me?'""
Thanks to Glint, Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts an employee survey every month, can solve the problem within one day, says Errett.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communication to resolve the problem successfully.
Ruby Tuesday acquires a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term, which is known for frequent redundancies.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the customer's tide, the whole company is going to go bankrupt."
Thursday has become the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about this.
But there weren't many temperature records compared to Tuesday Thursday.
Vedra hit Moravia mainly, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records of 35 of 145 weather stations measuring more than 30 years were exceeded or evened.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice, today's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, Břeclavsko, today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
Today, high temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice was the biggest heat in Dyjákovice in Znojemsko and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsko, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but it did not beat the record.
On the other hand, according to the ČHMÚ website, today's highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius in Western and Northwest Bohemia.
"Teplots only started to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear according to ČHMÚ and even more pronounced rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Fridays and in the southeast Moravia on Saturdays.
There's been a lot of trouble here.
Billionaires don't get the same vote in an election as every single adult in the country.
They want to make direct decisions, and because not everyone is as rude as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, buys political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva along with other colleagues on the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryčem sponsors Robejškovy Realisty.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted Corruptor and King of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Party of Privates.
The political movement Agrofert, as Andrei Babiš's project was named by Kroměřížský mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for itself.
The mayors also recently caught their billionaire.
It's Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the Jablotron security facility.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entree in the mayor's jersey didn't do very well.
"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win 20% of the Mayors movement in the elections.
Everyone smiled.
But Grandpa's misrepresentation is more typical.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinion.
As much as he intends to apply for votes in the mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babiš.
He supported Babiš in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule with the popular rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Babish will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said that he wanted the Mayors to learn how to work with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stand up for himself no matter what jersey he wears.
Others can speculate whether Babiš is sending someone this clumsy to the Mayors to build his B.
Others may wonder if Jablotron's boss, for example, broke up with Agrofert's boss in a bad business and was looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Grandpa's first public appearance wasn't just about Babiš.
Grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors' campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to put a stop to such a statement.
After all, the court-renowned crook Zdeněk Bakala threw millions at all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the Vita Bárta Security Agency, the TOP 09 and the Civil Democrats came together like this for nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to the political party.
When Grandfather enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he wouldn't have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
His first days in politics were crowned by a proposal for tax advantages for families with studied children.
People with college education come to about $50,000 a month.
Those with basics for less than 20.
A man with 50,000 is rich at the local level.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandpa's vision, the poor pay their taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of a welfare state that they do not participate in.
The rich simply need to be helped to avoid poverty with need.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babiš can rub his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
There remains a question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not hold members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and country for their property.
Finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich land, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to go down by 234 million.
Sometimes selling real estate isn't easy.
And sometimes even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by President Donald Trump of the United States.
At the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down by an incredible £8 million.
He informed Mirror.co.uk about this.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But the connection of the real estate company to the US president didn't defend an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible £8 million.
The original property price was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's no wonder.
The magnificent 5 acres on the Caribbean island of Svat Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Tens of palm trees are planted on the property.
The terrace has a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers has been expressed on the price.
Now the property is closer to the current prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property was to buy for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with a new prize, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13,5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two training sessions a day.
The eleventh in the morning is approaching, and the players of U.S. football at UCLA are squeezing at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take their jerseys off and reveal their sweaty backs, the unmistakable mark of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members of these few minutes of doing nothing is a noon break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to their rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the meeting that will take place on the morning of 6:30.
"These guys are gonna have a hard time for the next three days," said Coach Bruins Jim Mora moments before Monday rolled over on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve players - paradoxically, training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exam is over.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. - to fit into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, which Mora spent as coach in Westwood, Bruins training camp begins a week earlier than last year and trainings are limited during the summer semester.
Eighteen training sessions are planned in total until August 20th, and formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team will begin in September.
Mora let himself be heard that it supports the decision of the NCAA, despite adding another item to the already charged schedule of players.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one gave up, everyone's trying.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed at the end of the training camp, which will not be easy looking at clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after harvesting the safety net behind the goal bar.
Players of the Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," added Mora.
"Safe is taken care of, but there's no way anyone can rent a room and record our trainings.
It's a good thing to do business with such material.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be all right.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans a more thorough check of facts to reduce the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under original posts in an attempt to combat the so-called "fake news", said the largest social network on Thursday.
The company writes in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will be sent to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results under original posts.
Facebook has been referred to as one of the main sources of false news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced last year's election of the President of the United States.
The French voters are flooded with avalanche of false reports on the May presidential elections, and Germany is planning to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of September's elections if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
On Thursday, Facebook stated in his next statement published in Germany that he was preparing to launch testing for a new function of checking false reports in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying messages verified by third parties, people ask for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision about what they can share," said Sara Su, the Product Manager of Facebook News.
She added that Facebook continues to test the function "related articles" and also works on other changes in order to reduce the number of false messages.
Creating a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
Scotney Castle recently played a major role in Squeeze's music video, and Margaret Thatcher found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy place by the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, which inspired curly Jamie Rhodes of York County - a well-known hobby in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"I am fascinated by the look on the handwriting of a man who is 300 years after death," Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter, I feel a personal connection."
Graphic novel A Castle in England documents the life of families who resided in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Eduard period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired British Library documents - a project that was very emotional to him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated with old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England organization and the possibility to reside almost four months in the castle almost like a dream. (To tell you the truth, I extended my stay a bit.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyenas on the wall and the bottles that have been dumped in a ditch for centuries.
He walked around the property and examined the ruins of an old castle, talked to gamekeepers, gardeners and sometimes also artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
"Drinking whiskey and writing" last night.
Scotney's confidential history is a relatively large unknown since National Trust acquired access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as when "the aristocrats of many centuries scattered their hands with the words: "Bring it into the attic. ' "
Journals, letters from the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You may think a dispute over land is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were dragging their birch.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and dig deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of mutiny at the castle in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually began in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected in the end."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, who tells the story of a Jesuit priest whose family Darrell's family has been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th - century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was found only a few years after the coffin was unveiled).
Rhodes' favorite family is Darrell's: "I was intrigued by male tribes - men at that time were always in debt and spent money on things they could not afford.
The different generations of Darrell family have dealt with this by marrying rich or old wives - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to mangle their heads with heiress."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week gig in the Finnish wilderness, where he soaked inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
But it's a strange place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, "Now to get the hell back to real life."
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump on a new US immigration plan, which will also change when granting a green card.
It is assumed that the number of legal immigrants will thus fall by 50 000 year on year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will do so by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will be preferred by English-speaking applicants who will pool funds and demonstrate skills that will benefit our country," said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, there's an online report on the technological development of sex robots.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to view the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more and more often," Sharkey said on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pan to robot women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course artificial intelligence mimics human behavior.
The user can "modify" the robot in his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own "personality" that would also shame Stepford's mistress.
Modern inflatable virgins evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set various character traits for his substitute wife, including shyness.
And then there's a sex robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, who is delivered with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah" which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "goodness" nature.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, talkative, or "in the mood."
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - one that does not include confusion for real interpersonal relationships. The concern is rather inferior female character traits and violent innuendoes - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion resembles Roxxxy to a male vibrator on its website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not merely a fetish or a sexual tool.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - moving away from ideal or sexual equality towards captivating sex with an optional markup.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robot woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the edge of the public's interest.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they're given an excuse to free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world earn their rights and in the White House sit the president, who is often very vile at the address of women.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The story of the maid is not what we see - hanged bodies and eviscerated eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The story of the servant represents a step in the right direction, but it seems to be a small step at present.
Sexual robots are supposed to look as much like real women as possible (even with porn star rates).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to the touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would inspire their independence or disrupt their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
Says the 21st century: maids.
NBA star on a green chives.
Curry's fighting for cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry didn't lose sight of his first shot at a premiere start among professional golfers.
The double winner of the award for the most useful NBA player played the first round at the Ellie Mae Classic tournament at the lower series Web.com Tour in Hayward California on 74 shots and will fight for cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors team this season, started very nervously and his first shot ended up in a liquor holder in a golf car parked by a fairway.
Even after that, he wasn't as precise as under a basketball basketball basketball basketball basketball basketball, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four shots above the par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first hit, but then it sat down a bit," Curry said, saying that he had a huge fright.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot at the tournament, but it was everything I hoped it would be.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he said.
If Curry succeeds in fighting through a cut that is likely to be set two shots below par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've gotten rid of stage fright, I think that's gonna work," said an enthusiastic golfer who has already played celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time at a tournament that falls under PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exception and maintained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's great victory?
Against that, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unmistakable sign of Trump's era is political divisions that divide American voters and tear families apart on a micro scale.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper was crawling with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for our nerves to come out.
However, less attention is paid to Trump's ability to unite the family.
I'm talking about it because my cousin - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago - visited me in New York this week and who has been paying for a Republican idiot in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that bonding in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom they bickered about politics for years - is on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it is a good thing; but I am amazed that, in a broader context, this poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
Speaking of normalization and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his clown shops may one day lose their attractions.
But there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - the dog on the roof of the car, 14% tax on income (at least we had an awareness of his tax return) - both of which look like very slight misdemeanors compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will be sufficient for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We used my cousin's visits, and we took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your $3 unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and staring at their own shoulders in terror - quite a gloomy sight, and the clinking music strangely resembles public transport.
Many clichés get tired soon: the view from the high-rise buildings, the skyline looks instead of breathing in the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't really Swiss cheese - counting the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, the carousel in Central Park brings a remarkable magical experience, to the point where two two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, will have a great time.
If I could evaluate the carousel, he'd deserve the most points, but no one's lucky to ask.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the shop when I was asked to evaluate my "experience" on a scale of one to five when I was paying my credit card.
It's the same in the coffee shop on the corner of my street, with the difference that I can put 15% of my tips on the ratings for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only is it slowing down otherwise fast sales, but waitress is thus forced to intrude into the shoppers' favor when it is not necessary.
A woman at the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly rated my five-star credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for a cut on his wrist, which, according to the prison, he caused himself after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original manslaughter sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning on Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet closet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
The plaintiffs have announced their intention to rescind, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority has stated that it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with an extension of his sentence for up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a young child was born in captivity by a panda that mated in the wild.
It's a huge success for the Pand rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of the captive panda.
Zhang Zhong told New China that Pand breeding is at great risk of inbreeding.
Only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
Only 2,000 of them survive in the wild.
Trying to mate captive pandas with the wild ones is the first step to keeping the pandas to protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cao-Chao was released to the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists could observe her every move.
The Chosen One met Cao-Chao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with a panda male lasted a minute and a half and ended successfully.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males quite poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, plus they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, it weighed 216 grams after delivery.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, quoted by the BTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on August 1st in the morning by the Sithoni police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for the cTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not permitted.
The checks will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilk is in the 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfist Klára Spilková appears after the first round of Major British Open in 50th place.
The course in the Scottish Kingsbarns bypassed the score one punch under par when she played three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player has the hope of going through the cut for the first time at the famous major.
The entry into the $3.25 million subsidy contest was best released to the American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the 64-morning record, i.e. eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands withdraw millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch Food Safety Authority has announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which in its view means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined the closing of farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians shall take random samples of eggs and chicken originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland on whose markets there have been problematic insecticide marks.
The eggs from Belgium were according to the veterinary administration on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
But there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of flea, everything and tick products.
However, they must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga's beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, she says "Sedláček" and she's looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there someday," smiled 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start a season in a zlin jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to judge it like I did at school, it would be three.
I didn't catch much in the first year, I had a skilled goalie in front of me.
I've been studying.
I started catching for the second year.
Before season three, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie I took turns with.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only scored five points, so the coaches started shooting it.
At the end of the day, my colleague had more to catch.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is KHL for goalie?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slavic who have to change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the field width.
The difference is the Russians want to play empty.
Less shooting, and even if they're half empty in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic after all.
Didn't you have trouble traveling and moving through seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's no problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done by playing like four games outside, and then you get two days off.
How do Latvians even feel about their club in KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it's a national sport.
Everybody cheers.
Even when things didn't work out, there were a lot of people walking.
Did Dinam's work in KHL help Latvia almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their results at the World Cup have started to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to Czech extra league.
Roberts Bukarts made his way to Zlín and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural course.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still off the hook?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't continue in Riga.
Then we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We've been talking to different teams, but in the finals, they've decided on someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín, waiting for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about this?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am home after some time.
I caught something at KHL, so I'll take it from here.
The only question is when and where do I sign?
How real is the option of starting a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what happens in a month.
Now all I can do is wait and see what the agent has to say.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season wasn't so much for me to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government fling at Let goes on.
In January this year, I wrote in an article with care of the proper economy, including about the camp at Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to remind myself of the fundamental passages of the article.
We've been talking about Camp Lety for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what it is, it is probably best if they look at the official site of the cultural monument Pietti place Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical survey, they will learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of Lety, that from 8. 8. 8. 1940 it served as a work camp, from 1. 1. 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2. 8. 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 persons were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 of them in total.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings that have brought them back to human beings and perverse ideologies.
There is no dispute that these events need to be remembered at all times.
Nor does it dispute that this commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
The camp was somewhat forgotten during socialism, and in the 1970s the farm was built near and on parts of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was discovered in Lety.
In the mid - 1990 ' s, the government promised to buy back and tear down the pig farm, but it has not yet.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the farm.
So very briefly the facts of the postwar fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy back the pig farm.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "there are numbers, but I would probably be thwarting those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, others say the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, there's no way it's gonna be cheap.
At the same time, just a few hundred metres from the former camp, there is a memorial, in which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the United Nations Human Rights Committee financed the transaction beautifully, which is probably not a threat, I think it would be just as much a waste of money.
Doesn't the government have any other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified memorial site, stands in the will of history practically close to the tragedy that has taken place, and anyone who wants it can bow to the memory of the sufferers and the murdered.
I see no reason to change that!
Let's keep it as it is, and let's keep the memorial place as careful as possible.
The responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should handle the care of a proper economy.
At least with one like your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
However, I still see from the point of view of the above facts the password of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election declaration.
I went to see the place this May.
Very decent driveway, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exposure, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with a seating option and a view of its own pietní place, which is made of stones located on a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as appropriate and belonging.
At present, archaeological research takes place on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the exposed bases could be preserved and accessible visually at least in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could push his efforts.
If he succeeds in pushing the purchase of a pig farm for state money in government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic work as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 UK patients causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
The head of Dr. Marco Colonna's study explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure removal of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales are tilted to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, scientists have found the presence of immune cells supporting the tolerance of the body in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the protein building blocks to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a connection between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestinal microbioma and the development of cells that promote tolerance of the body.
The more tryptophan mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri bacteria and diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerated and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postgraduate researcher in the study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of identical mice kept separately lacked cells.
The result is that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbioma - a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
Mice's bowel was tested by DNA sequence method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing from the second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked a intestinal microbioma - so they did not develop this kind of immune cells - were administered by L. reuteri - and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters in the fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the fluid it has been shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been detected in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammatoryness of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signing of the contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be "genius"
Manchester United got into his team "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after a backup player debuted against Sampdory in Wednesday's game.
Matić, who signed a contract for £40 million, entered the first win of 2:1 in Dublin - the last preseason match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United meets Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a backup player alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not take the form and only played for 45 minutes, which, according to Moorinha, is necessary to work on before the next Premier League season.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - it thinks soccer," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Just like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho began to shape their eleventh for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club did "a fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players into the team.
"Thanks to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would make me happier, but I admit they've done their best for me."
Life's Challenge to the King of Chicken Skins Ládi Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to draw thanks to the new TV show on Prima Zdeněk Academy.
The pear immediately smelled a chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to join you in your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called on him in a social media video.
And since those two have been cutting edge for several years, Láďa hasn't forgotten to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojemská from diet chicken, American cucumber or invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is popular," Pryška said.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move upstairs and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say," he said to Lightning.
But Pohlreich didn't comment because he was shooting new parts of his next show Yes, chef!.
Only Prima responded to the participation of Pears in the culinary academy, considering the matter as a personal activity that goes off television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich took his first cook in the morning.
In a few days, over 300,000 pieces have been sold to her!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at the press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme is an authentic cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from among the audience and in 12 works he will introduce them to twelve cooking techniques.
In the last episode of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk had his shirt ironed with a crossed-out pear on his back.
If he had my face in there, I'd be laughing a lot.
"I only smile over the pear - the pear is healthy fruit and has lots of vitamins," Láďa responded.
Lada's culinary art thinks its own.
"Cooking according to Ládi Pears is not an option at home either, because I will not let the gastropunk go home," the boss is clear.
I appreciate Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, even according to him I make a chicken for honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show," Hruška did not forgive himself.
He's an asshole!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomy analfabet or asshole," said Pohlreich about Hrušek at a lecture.
"I'm not 20 years old to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't care about them anymore," Hruška said at the account.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. A simple wave of his hand can unlock the door from the house and the office and even start the car.
Steven Northam, 35 years old, had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger, and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure of implantation and compliance with treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers an exchange of door and car locks compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which started with a simple wave of his hand.
The White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The decision of the White House to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry last month was $24,000.
The Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program in the White House, which was a parade of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials have been looking at a product show from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift cart from Mississippi.
Military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn under the "extraordinary" event, reported Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for managing the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such a significant event," wrote HMX-1 in an e-mail to his superior, deputy commander of the Navy for aviation the day before the start of the event.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of a parade scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and will remain in place until the whole place was completely cleared out, scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that if there was a delay on departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for a return flight due to a working time regulation.
The original crew remained on site that evening along with the helicopter and along with them also a unit of security personnel.
The records - which the Time weekly received - did not show if the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible breach of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was okay," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," wrote the deputy commander.
This show "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President advocated a health reform that went through the Senate and talked about an attempt to keep government regulations under control.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them to travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was riding in the background during his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is pleased with the show "Made in America', which presented products from all 50 states produced by Americans from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landing in the Washington and South Lawn area and rehearse possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the current crew training, stated the state official.
The helicopter unit on the same day was flying under the "non-president support missions" for the next eleven hours.
The White House said that no additional props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
Sikorsky said that the company was in no way involved in the negotiations on the exposition of a helicopter to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not retain budget records for presidential flights and the exact cost of the show is, according to the Navy, difficult to determine.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, is the reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3D $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to place taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenditure," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the costs of the DoD do not include personnel costs but include fuel costs, maintenance costs and contractual costs.
The White House's press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter for parade purposes.
"The idea of the parade taking place this week is to introduce products manufactured in the USA," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state and that they provide work for hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities that countless American citizens are involved in making.
This is a fact to be recalled."
It is unclear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his rounds at South Lawn. With certainty can only say that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House Trump approached Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own three myself."
A young woman got stuck in a swamp by Mácha Lake, and the police waded to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2:00 a.m.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the marshes.
When she decided to ask the police for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"Therefore, the police soon lost contact with her," said police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols set out for the location she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to wade through reed marshes hundreds of meters before they felt the solid ground again," Baláková approached.
And that's how she was missing.
The police were oriented according to the direction on which her cry for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count aloud," said the speaker.
Cops didn't find a woman until quarter past five in the swamps of Borny.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological forces and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance brought her to the hospital in Czechoslovakia.
The old man's connection to STAN?
A desirable bride becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project, it's like a billionaire telling voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that a politically disparate group of less-known mayors and independents did not actually have a national agenda for the House elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after interviewing Grandpa, no matter what political opinion he has.
That's how Vít Bart started out once, and it didn't work out very well.
In his rush to decent people and personalities, which will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, which Gazdík also admitted, the popular argument of Chief STAN also disturbs Dědek that the greatest value of the movement is politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and according to surveys.
They're gonna take turns picking up unknown personalities on short notice.
Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the popular candidates.
But if only a few suspected of identity by STAN then, after the arrival of Grandfather, the mere game of identity ends.
Not only Haszdík long defined himself against YES Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, said as follows: "My goal is that the Yes movement, the Mayors movement, should gain 20% in the upcoming elections. "
Let's hope he didn't mistake the movement.
Grandpa's a successful businessman, and a billionaire's definitely not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has for some time been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to make the desired bride even more of a sales girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the folks, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police dogs trained in Most by helicopter
The dogs specialized in explosives search and search dogs were rehearsing at Lake Most by helicopter.
The police dog must not be afraid and afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the Ústí Region Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
At Most, they trained both adult dogs and those who have just been trained.
In addition to standard training, in which they were to detect sharp explosives samples around the lake and seek a lost figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the chopper gets in, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"The helicopter gets in, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tomášek said.
A dog that is restless or is unable to start working immediately on a helicopter journey is excluded from training.
"Most of the time, dogs keep them in the garden," Tomášek added.
Police have 76 dogs in Ústí Region with various specialties.
German Shepherds prevail, but also Belgian Shepherds are growing.
The dog dog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He is raising him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal possible health disability.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, it will take its first exams in 20 months.
"He gets into sharp intervention about two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of police service depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.
Trailer on season 3 Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture and Cali Cartel is the centerpiece of the Netflix hit series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer is discovered, the Netflix series is far from over.
The confirmation from the streaming service has already been received in the third and fourth seasons - the first one has already received the first trailer and the outline of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate "as a Fortune 500 company," only with the difference that they escalate acts of violence and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a figure recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement officers in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will take its premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate in them, stated on the Wednesday of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Support Mission, said that hundreds of women are involved in elections to local councils, three women are applying for Vice Presidentship, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his Wednesday statement.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate, as well as all related processes related to the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has made several threats against the electoral process, which shifts international combat activity to a second track.
For the first time ever in this year's election, one democratically elected government transfers its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan independent electoral commission stated that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery is brewing beer again.
To a good beer for a rebirth brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the brewery in Lobč u Mšena.
The brewery mentioned for the first time already in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a steam engine operation.
Years of bloom followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, buildings have served the state estate.
The work of destruction was perfected by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzová.
They started repairing buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to studying archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery is the same as in the nineteenth century when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded by the declaration of the brewery for the cultural monument of the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European trails of industrial heritage.
In 2015, they celebrated the tradition of brewing beer.
If you want to taste great lobby beer in the picturesque countryside of Kokořínska, visit the bar in the brewery area.
They use the Kokořín water in the protected landscape area, malt from the fields of the lobby and harvest hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at 1:30 p.m.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest fortresses of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique construction was to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, on the top of the field ridge above the village of Babi.
Originally, it was to be made up of 12 bunkers connected by extensive underground.
This was to be the headquarters, barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, power plant, engine room and hospital.
But the Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, the only massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique construction in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
Subterranean access is 75 percent!
Apart from the infantry cabin T-S 73 with exposition and underground, the complex includes an armed light fortification building, two assembled infantry cabins, trenches and an educational trail of Fortification Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and breathtaking landscape views guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been added to the list next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Klášter Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which now consists primarily of a massive four-winged building of the Convention above the beautiful garden.
The list he got on, but unfortunately it belongs to unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
But enthusiasts do not want to give up, and to support the monastery they organize a lot of events.
One of them is another year for Chotěšov monastery this Saturday, August 5, where among others Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Vlas, will see swordsman's performances and look at the places of magnificent large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

The chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, taste culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, bouncy castle, Smurf competition trail and of course a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free app Pl@ntNet will help students with the creation of herbalists and ordinary plant lovers.
If they're interested in what plant they just stumbled across on a walk, these apps will advise them.
All they're gonna have to do is photograph the plant, and the application itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre of Ethical and Environmental Education in Bratislava Mountain Park under the project Secret Life of the City.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the site Secret Life of the City.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can identify.
"Children who hold a tablet or cell phone in their hands can go into the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of this project.
Based on sufficient quality photos of the flower, leaf or fruit, the application can recognize its name in seconds, which it assigns under the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the application by taking a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
The concerns of GMB regarding investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The unions demand assurances from the managers of the McVitie's cookie maker about the long-term commitment of production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish GMB trade union has indicated that the company is still silent on any investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory has more than 500 employees who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies among other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said that over £5 million had invested in the entire area over the past few years.
It added that the employees and representatives of the trade unions would be "between the first informed" in case of changes in the plant operation.
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scottish GMBs expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not receive his promises of financing and modernising production lines. "
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the construction manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
There have been generations of many families and employees mostly come from the local community and Glasgow area, where working in the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social isolation.
From the point of view of work, salaries and benefits - and despite Brexit's outlook, rising cost of living and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie's."
Pladis spokesperson said: "The construction manager Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we value the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and this meeting was openly discussed about many problems.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: "In recent years we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and traffic efficiency.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and local locations and, in the event of any changes in the operation of the local factory, the employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymara's transfer three years ago?
La League may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to take his side after £ 189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymara from the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona about its record raid three years ago?
Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby's transfer to Manchester United, which paid £89 million for it last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is indignant in the way Neymar made a commitment to his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in taking over one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, we will certainly address one of their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary line when she expressed an interest in PSG's backup, Marc Verratti, in the summer.
PSG has made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances will allow an Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill in its presumptuous negotiations with Neymara's departure.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump nodded to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China wasn't doing anything about the North Korean threat and that it wouldn't go any further.
Even from that, the idea of sanctions is as good as straw from shoes.
Those things can't be thrown together.
Maduro's Venezuela really set off for dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not merely acting as the US President would like it to be.
Russia is a chapter to itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even a normal elector, American, European or otherwise, would understand what the system of rules is based on the policy of sanctions, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely catching up on what President Obama has already set up, giving it a postmark.
Then why such a fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the US elections, he would hug Putin and appeal sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions don't loosen up, but they tighten up.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Secretary Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
You mean kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are neither kosher nor anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission Chief Juncker complains, again, that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean to use sanctions so weak that they don't put anyone at risk?
A regular voter is groping.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the fulfilment of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now learned that this is the EU's energy security.
The voter is groping even more wide.
The sanctions are coming to Russia for too much assembly where it doesn't belong.
China is being scolded for not fitting enough.
The Venezuelan President is being punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All these punishments or reflections have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
I'm not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crucifies the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Besides the Pardubice Region, he's already finished with all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian-Silesian administration and the shadow minister of education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a Governor," Babiš confirmed.
You have upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with your theory that directly elected mayors and mayors should run the municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are voting directly for the President, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about canceling the deputies, they might as well be there.
The question is, how many are there?
When I presented your book, what I dream about when I happen to sleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about abolishing the councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is blamed for not building enough and not preparing major projects, but she has no competence.
The same is true of a government run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not what I'm saying they did right.
But the current Prime Minister doesn't run anything, he just hosts the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
He'd be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
All we have in the program is a change to a one-wheeled election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a slippery mandate for ministers and an adjustment to the Rules of Procedure of the House to avoid unnecessary exhibition by Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be presented at the House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will govern the government, control the House with 101 Members, abolish the regions and the Senate, and take over the country through grateful mayors and mayors.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron announced a reduction in the legislature by one third, while there are 57,000 French on one legislature, while in our country it is based on 17,000 Czechs.
Of course, no one blames Macron for threatening democracy.
Even if someone won the elections majorityly in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
But the guidelines for those with a parliamentary majority are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the ANO movement.
We just need a team in the government to work for people, not for their guys or resorts.
I don't see why we couldn't agree that only teachers' salaries, employees in culture and social services would increase.
Why did they outvote me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who are already taking $60,000?
Would you like to step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency, and with the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers aren't supposed to argue with the government, they're supposed to argue with each other outside of it.
There's got to be some material in the cabinet, there's no room for coalition brawls, power voting and business, where it's supposed to be decided.
How do you want to have a coherent team when ministers are mostly partying?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition contract didn't apply, and drove Babish out of the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
However, if a person is and has control powers, similar idle gestures are not needed.
They measure them all the same, and they all require perfect performance.
Do you know who you'd suggest to the Treasury Secretary?
I don't think about it at all. I don't think we're even gonna be in that government. Nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I did that was so bad.
That's not the place for skepticism.
The mayors have acquired an entrepreneur Dědka who would like to cooperate with you, perhaps the wing of your favored Jiří Čunk will win the people's party.
I don't think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out the coalition with YES. Václav Klaus ml., who will also not oppose the coalition, may be promoted in the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of economics.
So the persimmons are considered as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran as a puppet of Vitus Bárta for VV, then raised money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a distinctive personality.
A little brown, though.
If I take his program, there's a broad involvement of people in the management of society, a direct democracy, I can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you at gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We don't think about working with Mr Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It's about negotiating the winner with the second in line, but God knows who's gonna be the winner and who's gonna be the second.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let's get back to your attempt to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka had everything driven away, never decided.
Coalition issues like ČEB or EGAP did not work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, ČEZ took over the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by CEZ's management, which he orders the Minister of Finance to vote at the general meeting of ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change your personnel situation in the Supervisory Board and replace CEZ's top management?
Jesus Christ, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with YES.
Well, maybe after the election, everything's gonna go back on track.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have a lobbyist named Pokorný or Rose, I'm a separate unit, and I don't care about that at all.
So answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you strive to exchange the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is trace Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state in ČEZ has a majority, it has never driven it, it was only there to number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ has to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary company, arrange funding, make a supply competition or get a coinvestor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocs is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent dedicated campaign against me, but I don't, and I'm not gonna have any authority to fire anyone.
But to control it, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay charges for public radio and television about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't know?
The House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of CEOs of ČT and ČRo.
Look how these reports are discussed, the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from the investigation files and to Lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid, he let Kalousek push himself to kick me out of the government, which scored a percentage of the TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them down.
They're afraid of disrupting their corruption system, so they're talking about threatening democracy with Babiš.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first Vice-President ANO Jaroslav Faltynek builds power facilities by placing his son in the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or České dráhy?
That's where we have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I blamed him a few times.
Faltynek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Finance Minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílová, Březina.
If there was any indication of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happened, we'd get rid of anybody, it wouldn't matter who it was.
