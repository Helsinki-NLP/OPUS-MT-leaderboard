What is going to happen? CSSD does not know Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new members of CSSD at the city hall of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real linguistic barrier in order to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the argôt that was born in the last few years at the town hall, when the partners of the current coalition were running in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials did not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I'm a young man in Pragian politics reacted to Lukas Kaucky, the one elected to culture in the "sponsor" vocabulary test.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only expression you're suggesting to me I'm using"
Otherwise, I don't use the sergeant.
From the vocabulary, including the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congress of the ODS, the editorial staff chose 6 examples, primarily those related to Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie, "beef nerf", "trahison of the capital" and "entôler".
Three of the elected representatives agreed on the quiz, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek totally refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand each other in our programmes," he said.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky apparently does not recognize in the above legend that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," said Kaucky and immediately added, "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm gonna have to buy a language class," he jokes.
Not only matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environmentalist, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "go to the pastry shop".
"I think it's about going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of the companies in Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no lexicon of argôt in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it appears that we really don't have something like this."
"We say the names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, whom the members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel Brezina about the nicknames.
The daily Current.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the least friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that social democrats in the party admit to using.
It is reported that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Pragian president.
"Doctor in the law of truncheons," it seems recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctorate in law JUDr. at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of witches, published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, unable to work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "sorcier" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this destiny."
"Youth women are also not judged to be healthy because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit the hunt to witches.
There's a "hic" in the case.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the daily Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
Charges of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil that they sprayed on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings was emblazed in contact with the woman.
The oil blazed, it seems, when the team wanted to "hun the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of sorcerers is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia has not later than last year even seen the President participate in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have tried by black magic to kill also the President."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, led to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, randomly chosen men and women in villages in the Gambia," the organisation said in a message "Amnesty International.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: The poeles are heating up, he has signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out through the door of the RPG Byty customer centre of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son who are serving a sentence.
The deregulation increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," points out on his son's new contract the man who has the signing power.
"But I've signed anyway," he explains angryly and half-resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which has described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published explaining the method to be followed in order to claim.
But man reacts to this with a hand gesture.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
For this reason Aktualne.cz decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "Money 2011", is on the touch screen.
Only one pressure and one paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts lighting up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents don't seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on the test," answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deragulation and the former miner's apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and native of the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the Social Democrats reported this in a fairly sustained manner before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a board put...n in the toilets, soothes in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to the employees, pensioners who come to make sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they now sign as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half the amount of rent that will be received by the other loctaries who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overburdened by questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG porposes on its website as well as in the windows of individual interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent it is an independent tribunal that will make the decision.
'These are not threats, but simply to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"Here no one will go to court," thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man on the street in front of the customer center is right.
"I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG has been able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 that should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung on the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room of Havirosvka street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments, or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments".
"And it will always be at the most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech kroner per square metre," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices have understood the architects.
the Avriopoint administrative building of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything they need - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees have been able to visit.
The Arch. Design project-architectonic company, whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has designed its mini-entrepreneurial school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially of age, to make children, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced working time contracts, the nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Mini Kindergarten is financed through the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (to the tune of 2.8 thousand Czech kronor) they were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years to provide qualified staff and start up.
After using the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it was Economy rating that helped to make the staffing request.
Children are cared for by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher attend the children all day long. Children can go to kindergarten without any age limit, but they are more than three years old for the most part.
Since this is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace themselves.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the mini kindergarten programme is comparable to that for pre-school education.
The children do not only play there, but also a quality education is provided - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of being late to pick up children in a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.has thus registered as one of the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi.
The toît resembles the back of a prehistoric saurien, the staircase with a spine of dinosaur and balconies with open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname House of Bone.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, colors and pleasant textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the glossy impression of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at the number 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-unit house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the facade have also worked other artists and creators.
Joint work for Casa Battlo's plans began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol took part in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila's house and the Guell Park, in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The premises nicknamed the house hot just after it was finished because of its organic forms "the House of Bone".
Others, having regard to the specific mechanism of opening windows, called it "the house that shoves".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi has designed for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with vents and typical chimneys.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi did not comply with the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow themselves to be obstructed by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finish the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, the members of the municipal council did not like the building pillars to encroach on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-story house is shared by a staircase through which you can access to a separate roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space liaison.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with lights wells.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark one, which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
Casa Battlo, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a lucrative business and they expanded the field of visits to common areas and attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist cardholders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in Gaudi's other constructions in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a base: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so the mattress and the box frame give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, height, age, state of health and gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which we will place the mattress and the frame is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not continuously sleeping are not appropriate because they are slowly "heating".
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in choice.
A person who spends time abroad, often using very thick mattresses with a crawling layer, will not feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hokeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a crawling layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they don't take "information" from the joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
There is no pressure on you and you will not turn around in the night as after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against esquarres.
For the choice of mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or in total 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matessiers and decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own base and mattress, so be careful however during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the base at different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimetres.
"To the touch or sitting on the mattress you must not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of base.
The bed-summary, when the mattress and the base are united like Siamoese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses went very badly; it should not be washed, which is commonly done in the morning.
And since during the night we sweat normally from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and blocked) sieve.
For this reason, specialists refuse to advertise over a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to his but.
And for this purpose, a board of experience from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make coatings with zipper for the whole, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when we remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight in a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a box?
Never!
Maximum for one guest bed for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Taschenfederken Germany) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress shall not be part of such a bed.
For single-position slats with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate its rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be used because they do not respond to changing positions.
Next to the adjustment of the stiffness of the slats one can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special bond of the slats that allows to press or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", it's really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "masculins" have begun to use a crawling area at the shoulder level.
But they also think about women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or plated frames with what is called a multi-strength suspension.
The pressure dissipates in more points and dins the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and spring, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians per exmple prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must level (with the shoulder cradle of the spring or the area rammolly in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to the organic mattress.
Petrol-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers are using soybeans.
"The organic qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop scents from the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" man, coatings "heat" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The current favourites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for the mattress and the base is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses can be held in special shares by manufacturers or producers for the price of a single mattress.
Like for example the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
This began as a material for NASA because astronauts were experiencing huge load factors at the start.
The Tempur branches to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and gives it optimal pressure.
For this it is ideal against sleeping evil and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or of the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly being requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think of monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as by exmple that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a match box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of Little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there will be another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company MAcro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of tracing devices on the Czech market.
"I confess that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," said Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to carry something of this type on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control'.
"Mobile phones, which can be cut off like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared rapt, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him".
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as tracing devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign".
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits that such devices can help in an unprepared assault by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, says having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The apparatus may be configured in such a way that it is on a regular basis after a specified period of time".
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
"The more expensive devices also have an incline meter that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in an elongated position without moving," says Cech.
According to him so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special prologiciel.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a pendant the size of a match box or smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that is why tests are being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to trace cars.
This is a combination of GPS-based position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of ropes is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating ropes from STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the achât of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, whom MF DNES has contacted, it is clear that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating ropes.
At this distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient for a maximum of 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen, we don't talk about it.
"And I don't take my head off if they buy such a large amount of detonating ropes from us."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the army is a good customer that we strive as traders to satisfy," says STV Group Chief Sales Officer Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, argues the achât of hundreds of km of detonating ropes by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of life of detonating ropes and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years," says one two who does not want his name to be published given the criticism of the army.
As the life span has passed, each munition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The ministry's other argument is a rebate due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of the pyrotechnicians of the police who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifespan.
This has been established for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible and modern types of detonating ropes.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralisation of tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army, with a force of two hundred thousand men, was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating ropes that it buys today "in cheap".
Until now I have benefited from contacts that I have obtained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun well for the place of winner of the contest of the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of last year's Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a shortage of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a small building of 5 half demolished apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of graduate studies, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," Pytloun says.
He began to rent the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has enabled him to open at Libérec 4 pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun hotel design.
This year another of the same quality happened to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels came forward," number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year served well," Pytloun said with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses up to now his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, success-related fame also had an impact on employees.
And he's got about 70.
"I observe in them above all the loyalty and pride of having committed to something that has been generally recognized."
"It is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," Pytloun said modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to seek the prize in Slovensky dum for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a 100 million kronor company.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me my collaborators as well and increased our self-confidence to fight against competition," said the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet society there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not very long after they started to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years he became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even to the non-specialist public after the success obtained in the contest through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they are working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year did not happen in Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts of new materials and technologies.
"We obviously did not escape this situation."
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and kept results that were beneficial even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
"We built with the endowments a training and research centre, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees also goes back to the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes insane regulations.
The survey of absurdity of the year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The unglorious winner of this year's survey of absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that public servants can obtain on-line.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for it.
For example, the Social Affairs Administration requested a paper extract from the Business Register while the official can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the Commercial Register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Highlighting all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to fill in in the Czech Republic and to have those that are absurd removed is the meaning of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and is still more popular.
If last year 3000 voters came forward, it was at least 4000 this year that brought their votes.
And that's no wonder, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that just slow down the company, and, that, more and more.
"We may be among the documents to be completed for tax returns at the top of the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Czech Republic's Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of conditions for the company, 8 more places compared to last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first launched in 2006 and continues every year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September each year, the last time before the competition closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for "the anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that received the largest number of votes is declared victorious.
Until last year's investigation, it was a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrets that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees is the obligation that highway and fast track maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always starts at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the final part of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts nudges in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decreêts is not a swordstroke in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the sole proprietorship at the place where the business is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007 to report a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee to the Labour Office was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything's okay until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decency for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and carry out a socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the rebel of the year contest.
For this first year of this sub-category of the 2010 competition of the firm of the year, organized by the firm Vodaphone, registered companies that have no success with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article should be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be seen as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is the Pragian Pragical Society And Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm in charge of the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for 17 years, which sponsors disabled children.
The old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of its employees, was awarded the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohemia region and placed third in the region at Vodaphone's "Firme of the Year" competition.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, won for introducing flexible working hours and even decreased to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also released the title because it buys priority from Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyan activity in the immediate vicinity and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The Man in the Shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
In the very last place, also for its activities, is a company of Lavage and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, higher qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
All the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had responded to the questionnaire as an attachment to the registration document and had sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
Inadequate or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm responsible but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition the Firm of the Year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition for the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police made arrests during a public competition
In the Earth Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been making arrests in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed the local entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubos. G.
He had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a restitution application in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider dealing in the context of a public tender and competition", said for the newspaper Pravo the head of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To find out how it could affect a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund said that the police officers had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no way an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Appeal to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Law on the Land" and is set up when several candidates who are entitled to it manifest themselves.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights of resitution which must be settled before the value of the land is announced".
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of purchasers is put in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had signed up for the call and since he himself is also a beneficiary because, having bought a large number of refund rights, he had offered candidates in the field not to take part in the contest.
And he was probably cashing in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
He appeared in the case of the former head of FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to set up a building had already been published.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained for example land for the construction of public communications, in concrete place and place where the access road to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is by far superior.
The town hall was obliged to accept because otherwise it risked endangering the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of some 100 kronor per month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to draw from their wallets up to a hundred kroner monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas is almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 kroner per year for households in flats.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the production of renewable energy, particularly photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it the most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more kronor per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 kronor annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent is being prepared for water and sanitation in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragos will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, ICC Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts softly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashion because it takes time to get drunk."
"The trend is really strong alcohol," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chew a bottle of papa in the wardrobe, it is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka that prevails."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the Motol Hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today it is fashionable alcohol especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the head of department Pelikan, seeing drunken children aged 13 to 14 at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide, drunken surroundings.
"A young girl was hospitalized so four times
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem weird to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department astonished.
It is precisely the unselfishness of parents or their unusual tolerance of the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking, which is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the term alcoholic one hears a chronic addiction to alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that one does not find in children".
"For those who use the repeated acool, it is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background," explained the Head of Department Pelikan.
According to spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in stastics.
Intoxicated children who are brought home after emergency care by the parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsites according to Pelikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Be they drink in spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays".
"Of course I lived on witch day an admission of 7 drunken children at once," said Pelikan.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in medical-controlled detoxification is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffered the day after the "wood chop".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by infusion of glucose and nutrients needed by the body.
"They are better off because they have an excellent evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and bed-based intensive care can range up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to pay back a single evening," said Pelikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover the burden of care from parents, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville in Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS aircraft is based.
This is the first time that such aircraft have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad on demonstration exercises or flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were previously in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence's press department, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is for the time being unknown.
'The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for exchange have been taken on long-storage aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence'.
"The two-seaters L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said for Pravo Pejsek.
He played that the army will not remain without two places since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 monoseaters into two two places.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one that takes L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries".
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The defence management argued that the trade would ensure a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and used only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen as part of a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men with a longer index than the ring finger are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before the age of 60," declared the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, in particular by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health antecedents, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
For those who had the index longer than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years of age the risk decreased to 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two mentioned fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates inter alia different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone matches a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for TKC that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, most of the time there is compact snow, clearingmen have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometers towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 road in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometer a truck was hit, at the 93rd two heavy goods vehicles struck, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it
Drivers should exit right after Brno at 190th kilometre or go by Brno and then enter 182th kilometre in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometres formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimetres thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created, for example, in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are lagging behind, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague Crisis Staff has yet to meet.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of the snow 7 fast links.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rollable but with increased vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there is beginning to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain routes of communication in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snowshoes and snow strawberries.
So far we can't estimate when they're rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is to be exercised in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads which are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of snow of 5 centimetres warns TKC.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimetres of snow; it fell the most in North Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimetres of snow.
The snow disappears gradually in the Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "go change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precision cannon
Its projectiles are laser guided with a precision of a few meters.
Special ammunition of 25 mm calibre developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works as small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
Nor is it protected from above and when it falls on it a deadly rain of steel shrapnel, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of sight, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the relaxation.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs outsourced
Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building of Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu group relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far in Marienbader Square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to have 100 more jobs scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. Furthermore, the open-plan offices of Astro Park are better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a prime location with remarkable infrastructure".
He claims that the connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and caused disappointment to the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global actor" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality at an early date of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the building at Place Marienbader.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I have the hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the railway station and the Town Hall, which aroused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to be used in part as parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment rating and consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group in Frankfurt specialising in Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group headquartered in Tokyo considers itself the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
To do this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Deportation of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet service provider has expelled from its servers the website specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently stayed in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks website is being attacked with increasing force.
The cyber-activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably stays in Britain, according to news reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", said Wednesday (local time) cyber activists at the origin of the revelations via the Twitter social network.
Shortly before, the cyber-company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the highest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Formatable, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN TV, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in view of Wikileaks' previous publications of classified information," the honourable senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security in jeopardy and jeopardy throughout the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks spread the content of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted persons.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Sweden's lawsuits as intrigues orchestrated by its critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls were even made for Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange fears especially for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief of Government Counsel Mr. stephen Harper said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, described the fact that Mr. Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and most recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely on the test bench for the protection of its databases.
According to a White House press release, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed responsible for the fight against leaks.
Mr Travers is responsible for implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where's all the ice coming from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, that is in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window with a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbeteer manufacturer founded the Ice University in 2003 to ensure that ice creams from its machines meet high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice and extend over several days. Also, practical sessions are organized in private ice cream.
In the midst of a quarantine crisis, a number of people are dreaming of a new career, others simply risk realizing their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, an art education professor from California, is passionate about the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer in the future a quality European product in the country of Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is an advisor in business management and after a few years she wants to draw something singular from this challenging job for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice creams.
Not only is good flavour, but silky flexibility and good consistency are crucial.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherries on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a great dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out a pasteurized white cream base, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately attacked by question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
He who speaks only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients", may have nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using stabilizers, only to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will eat nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications to the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano sets the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery section of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when cocoa powder is added, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of ice cream," says Luciano.
Icemaking is a calculation exercise: if you use peach purée with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
Additional sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as in the past.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mixture is beaten simultaneously to make it unctuous and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbles himself with fruit purée from head to toe and thus splashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident such as this may occur in each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has cored the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Mr Christoph There, Director of Testbiotech, Munich on Wednesday.
There is some information that the chair of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Group of Experts.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of Efsa's testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr.
The requirements drawn up correspond textually, in subparagraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the industrial mark which, in substance, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed sides.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which raised suspicions both from the German Federal Environment Agency and from MEPs.
However, the Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is an opinion that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from reaching out to this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he worked for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
It is seen as a neutral forum for experts who belong, among other things, to science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr.Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feed testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize is causing the field," says Mr. There.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not yield reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them then?" asked Mr.Then in an accuser tone.
That is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are only a few researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the view of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms Hilbeck states that "industry controls safety research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell obtained it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September, the excavators had come and started demolishing much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into an underground station that will cost several billions.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations ended in the construction work.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declared: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting it at the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment yet.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the dump," he says in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says that he was insulted and threatened when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took away one of the stone parallelepipeda weighing an average of 80 kilos with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still crowded in the forest, the rest of which have been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, private individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"wasn't this political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, goes around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and later began studying biology before he became interested in computer science and eventually became a carrier.
And a rock lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He gathers treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's refracting himself.
Stones of sand carved with art are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
He shows a pile of finger: red sand stone, before, part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Joli travertin."
The parallelepipeda was once part of the podium of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasian, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that once the stones were hand carved and moved with simple palans and carts drawn by oxen, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be torn apart."
He didn't get rich, much less rich.
Today, however, this carrier employs 14 people. In addition, stone tailors, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We're working hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are stones there too to save.
Struggle of talent to conquer high potentials
There's a lot of traffic in the counter.
16 students scramble to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea contest, they need to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go face to face in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most talented graduates as far as possible into the amphitheatres before they enter the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amasses the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department shares pens, candies and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; she shows them the paths to access the group's compound.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, look more closely at serious candidates and appreciate those who are involved as collaborators."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's happening again is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"In the past, the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In goods of sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a number of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, court the highly skilled labour force.
It is especially Graduates from engineering fields who find themselves in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the VDI German Engineers Association, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, auditing, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel this way to the United States.
Participants may also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who must participate in the selection shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, it seems to be there.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct crowding on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing quite classically by participating in professional fairs where they are engaged in brainhunting.
"We try to reach graduates by attending trade shows."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Ms.Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
At present, 35 positions are placed on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to carry out professional internships or write his or her end of study project to us."
Onerous advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
That's why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group can't do that," says Staff Chief Stübe.
Money has long ceased to play a major role in job search.
Other factors are flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he asked employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context, while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The Head of Staff Ms Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the image of the company among job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely mainly on external assessments with regard to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employee Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal action.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is through its own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When employees are properly treated and identified with the company, they themselves advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively cancel its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is still prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that led to this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this industry, had indicated his willingness to allow further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution want to reduce US dependence on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces several billions of claims, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry established by Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze on drilling after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security orders, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many accusations of corruption, is undergoing extensive reform.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would eliminate lucrative tax niches from oil and gas groups.
The players in this sector are now warning publicly that the feed flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than has been the case so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector" according to the results of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit firm, before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing through the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that found in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil destroyed Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't run out," says the environmental activist to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man in muddy water to the chest, as well as the greasy trail around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water to the color of the rainbow.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown slicks of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom reports that she used to collect shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely taric.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small neighbouring town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages comes to light when you go through the mangrove marshes crossed by streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat splits up a cracked brown water. Anyone who dives his hand in it removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of young mangrove emerge from the soil like licorice sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly hang their palms.
The clouds of birds are searched in vain, as they are usually found in wetlands: As soon as the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old that looks like a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is war against the environment," says Celestine Akpobari sadly: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger with regard to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The Ogoni region has been under siege for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the Ogoni country's oil fields are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trestles like strange sculptures: We very affectionately call "Christmas trees" the heads of boreholes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are gnawed by corrosion to the cue.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that which occurred in the sea during the accident of the super-oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the players.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider drilling head explosions and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner criticized Shell for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the pipe failure rate is "even higher than it is".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camboos and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camboos to the neck.
A fire flashes under one of the many barrels that sometimes connect to the pipes, sometimes scattered without grounds on the site must be located: a small underground refinery.
Crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe the kerosene drops fall and diesel is finally obtained.
For example, Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel drums every day: "This brings us back 34,000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents benefit from chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: For they acquire their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who drill the pipeline network throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in this way throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small, completely insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, charge the lion's share in tankers and rob it of the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate about whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only about the group's withdrawal. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will prove better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you left," announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even the soldiers, especially from the north of the country, intend to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
"From every point of view, this damn thing has brought down our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover building defects in A380 reactors
The A380 obviously has a major security problem.
By examining an aircraft that carried out an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible lack of construction that could lead to "a catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to Quantas had obviously been more fortunate so far: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of certain A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and warned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in connection with the connection of the oil line, it is stated in a statement published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a catastrophic failure of the reactors.
These are the Rolls-Royce reactors manufactured and equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
Quantas' Airbus, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas Director Alan Joyce stated that his company would claim damages for the incident in early November.
Parts separated and the carrying surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the oil inflammation that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos, which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be of sufficient importance to inform all parties concerned.
After his aircraft's emergency landing, Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily detained three of its eleven A380 aircraft.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor as a precautionary measure.
The two-storey plane is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos prevails on all roads, trains and planes.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany glitter: By cold temperatures, almost the whole republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to cope with the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that tidal waves will take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the Meteomedia bad-weather alert center announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt land, police authorities have announced serious disruptions on the roads.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused traffic interruption and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected highways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees fallen on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, the interregional transport of Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfalls resulted in numerous flight cancellations at the main airports in Germany.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said that 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers trapped at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this barely 400 beds are available to them.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled over a slippery carriageway in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could raise up to 500 million Euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of duty.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check if it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to release them at a later date."
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its seat shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million Euro from the equity holders and had subsequently rehabilitated them.
The energy optimisation transformations have, according to some indications, engulfed around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", to about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned or independent investor fund.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had thought about the buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the security situation of the affected well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors had no chance of surviving.
Up to now the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, relatives and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a bright sunlight in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, were also included.
Flags were put at half-mast in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative party participants that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that the miners will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits stated that he cannot resign himself to accepting his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The first aid workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the movie Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of assassination. When he is in a bad mood, he rips out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blindman speaks no word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the detour of one or two sentences a few horrific cries of agony.
Otherwise, we don't say anything and we celebrate in Scotland's incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape, which is the setting of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
Since the release of "Pusher", director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon with his trilogy of the fierce and stylish drug dealer, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most of the sympathizers of the art cinema must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
The lovers of action films die of boredom, when the Borgne embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to silence.
It is not surprising that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it only exists in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a dreadful soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully beside the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, with the aim of agitation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone to submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the euphrates; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has apparently built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating back to the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring town, el-Kibar, would be well equipped to produce plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, or even the inside of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, there is hardly more information than at the time, and even, in time, the mystery is becoming thicker and thicker.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, prior to the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but had little evidence to show that country was developing "an active nuclear weapons programme".
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumed reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation as "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as at the IAEA.
When asked how he ensured that he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, saying that the IAEA had "documents sufficient to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a systematic levelling of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of uranium produced by men in al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from a member State of commercial service providers showing the timing of the attack directly. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA challenged this argument after the particle analysis, calling it unlikely.
Since that time, damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
Moreover, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection at the al-Kibar site and refuse access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently declared: "We will never comment on this matter".
For example, the investigation into this case has been slow since June 2008 and has not been successful and is "more and more transformed into a serious problem of credibility for the Agency", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, finally, it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that progress requires clarifying the existence of the other three facilities that must be "functionally related" to the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities this is, or what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of neighbouring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these localities and discovered a complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which would most likely be one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is in or directly adjacent to a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites by IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group would in fact be spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by American secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photographs, indicating that vehicles have commuted between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped in order to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve for the production of fuel".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would later have been separated.
It is not known whether rubble, which could hide valuable traces, has been stored at all three sites.
Once the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have any information on the place where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria would have had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photographs taken on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photographs, however, show that Syria has undertaken earthworks at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these locations.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to rule out suspicion.
He said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months drawing up a plan for the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was intended to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported in this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador who has been talking about what is known as special inspections for a few months, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has at its disposal to implement its controls.
The Director of IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose such inspections, had already spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future", but he was still hesitant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, as this diplomat who gives to reflect: "To this would he serve, if in the end they found nothing"
Love in times of war
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
There is a persistent rumour that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, certain filming sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. Already a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to meet them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script says enough about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended to the High Commission of the United Nations that it withdraw the status of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come afterwards despite this permission.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a great deal of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and to give the opportunity to all the interested parties to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim loves his executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, as Jolie puts it, is "injust and based on misinformation."
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can give him peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, things are going well again with the Irish.
No sign of consternation.
This is why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy against the background of strong music, they tripping feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in south irland vibrates because the players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in the opposing team's beer cups.
This weird show is called "beer-pong". The winner pocketes 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computerist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the dull question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
"However, I feel a strange feeling," he says.
"The native country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the dark outlook in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, and his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanning.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even anticipate a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a pattern of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now took over.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects the well-trained young Irish people who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social deprivation seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's excess money.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times published extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants complaining: "In Ireland, everything goes adrift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the possibilities, goes away and our country so a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing powder into the eyes and offering no prospect of a future for young people.
"They cut minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She sees how her comrades cling to one practical internship without pay to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years' time.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" show, which offers an integral support on the theme of "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new workers in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a mess, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visited his home country, as he took part in an additional work station, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the native country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I almost no longer live."
It bursts with an embarrassed laugh as it passes through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house jointly with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
"These were moments of madness, no doubt the money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything fall apart because of the credit?
O'Donovan reflects for a moment, tightens hot tea and says: "I have no children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears lately.
"No one must suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life simply continued."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future be and find out how life is going elsewhere.
In his list, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life must not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there's still one thing she's worried about in the last few days: the party to be held on the occasion of her 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says, drinking a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, however, seems disturbing."
"Let's call it a night of goodbye, relaxed, bringing together some friends, with a few drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the last Latinobarómetro survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific region of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said that they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shaken support for democracy.
This has held true during the global financial crisis, certainly because many countries in America have experienced only a short recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and declined again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their loved ones has been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country devastated and plunged into fear.
Ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballots scattered in the gurneys, ransacked polling stations and intimidations were presented.
The polling stations opened late at night.
Many of the Haitians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, were wandering around to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, regards the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, is to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no visible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round of the second round.
With an epidemic of cholera raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, it's clear, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, received a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Mrs Fernández's obviously grieving choice that she would or would not abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation sank into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which made falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of a desire to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be developing towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to the consolidation of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentinians returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband's policies.
A half-hour for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his older brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million electors ran on November 27, or 70% of the eligible people, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment by the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiments about the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but he just did.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five town halls, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned towards Taiwan's complete independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with KMT on municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including teasing country trucks and mass-gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal dress.
An attempt at a mandatory mysterious assassination was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Link, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had an impact on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner in the election was China.
It was striking that the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from instilling anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a renewed awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwan majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the market.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see political integration; but let's start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he went wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates was born under the leadership of Tsai and the PDP is doing everything possible to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for the Chair, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results had they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to run for the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
KMT has to do a self-introspection.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson for KMT said that his firm and its local branches would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a major nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules according to which an artist must not release more than three albums before the recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", has certainly taken a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones' fulgurant success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, voters at the Grammy Awards rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a thrill-invigorating tour of a recording that was one of the top favourites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favourite with the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequent guest at HBO's "Tree", was honoured in the contemporary jazz category, which is also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the big category together; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his byte's live was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
Classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer's Madolin Concerto, Avner Dorman, is also competing for a reward.
The classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering recordings of orchestra, opera, choral and solo.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are Bruckner Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 had its first performance at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-magnat of oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's Mandolin Concerto was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he had gone through the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the mandolin Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle East sounds and a lot of North African ranges and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received an appointment in the orchestra category, for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist names: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical blends, soprano Jessie Norman received a nomination for her recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project is approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the commissioners ruled on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking out for or against the centre, at roughly the same time as the Press-Enterprise said.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families has been co-existing without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a truly "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in the research of life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to activate biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Global and Spatial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't an accidental discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; for example, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, agencies find it difficult to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in a way, erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The bacterium known as GFAJ-1 was collected and exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she says; for example, researchers hypothesized that the first life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just how life on Earth was originally formed," Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two display dogs out of four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, and the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced it on Thursday.
The four display dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday," said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in what neighbourhood and the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, the authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of Japanese dogs, were reported missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Champion "AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days before the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stoppages of the couple's almost a month-long canine exhibition tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could look fresh.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting only for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, officially leased Thursday the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that approximately $5 billion of the debt would be erased; paving the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there are no legal obstacles left before MGM to get under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general managers of what will become a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has entered into a $500 million credit facility to finance MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently being licensed by the investment bank, which itself stands at $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, General Manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary to do everything again as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exited bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collected $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million "success premium".
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which has only released one film this year, and to create an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio is required to enter into a separate loan between $265,000 000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic beads, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are plush toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them on their stomach.
A pressure is equal to one note, and a second one allows to compose a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to turn a ride into a car into a session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo from VTech ($60, for ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for ages 3 to 12), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that displays family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 $, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing blocks online before time flows, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6-12) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
They can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years or more) is the last button cell micro-robots.
The fake bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also strong.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage through our dog's mouth.
Bring a softer side to maintaining law and order in China
Tang Shenbin was walking around a city square like an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, issuing orders in low voice with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, who were imposing law and order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence, to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Stay straight!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and trousers, were freezing at your attention.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four neat hats perfectly perched at the top of hair attached by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a graduate degree.
Guangdong Province exchanged the grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the lower eyes with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packs his things and leaves.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, galbe and young age.
The idea is to give the rough police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty attracting attention to this underground urban brigade of China.
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the Hubei provincial inspectors beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game imbued with violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assaulting street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government," lamented China Daily last year, a national publication, after an umpteenth polemic on tactics.
The paper called for a "true complete cleanup."
Skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had any real jobs or whether they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district announcement required female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must be larger than the average size, i.e. 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officers stated that the work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the candidates' external qualities will determine whether they are appropriate; this is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement relative to the order of facial features.
That it means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured people should not apply.
"We can't let a limp or a hunchman come here to serve," Zheng says.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrolled Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the presentation of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked disillusionedly.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimple colleague, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply hunting sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as much bread or tofu bowls as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu while a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart bike.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than arduous.
"It's pretty much the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumours that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
Over one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police officers and officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or fired.
Xindu has thus far escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted scandalously.
A 15-minute arm followed before the police, with a sinister face, collided with their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned back to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men 40 years of age or older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case involving an assistant in a former campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced on Wednesday the senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case did not make the national headlines last year and harmed his career.
Mr Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, which was the result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's counsel stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice refrained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign was conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr.Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, obtain lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of Mr.Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called ban on the rotating door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and of a substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients of a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks from its Public Integrity section, including last year's decision to drop the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens on charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms," said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basicly says high-ranking government official can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel for Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that on Monday he had received a telephone call from a Department of Justice prosecutor and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The election commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr.Ensign has helped Mr.Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marting" the Department of the Interior on a contentious issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as leader in the fourth Republican rank in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr.Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr.Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, stated that the honourable senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing off in the courtroom rows.
Every minute they sent reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children attached to their beds in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in the court that outlines appeal arguments, which could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - created a "circus atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instant with incendiary details that the jury was badly influenced by the public's passions.
The application could lead appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this at this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms violates human rights at a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, counsel for Mr. Hayes, Chief Counsel.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgement, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Appeal courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of well-known cases can raise issues about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of an osteopath from Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the appeal courts seized to review half a century later Mr. Hayes' conviction may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication in the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could lead to fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who can be discussed for years, which delays the execution.
Defence counsel also asserts, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors reported that they were horrified by photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, respectively.
The defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical before the prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to have the jury deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors have not been kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, tabled last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the post of Governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept on fuelling the flames of the emotion of the affair.
"The daily hustle and bustle of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that instant news was more incendiary than press releases submitted more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers stated that courts of appeal were often attracted to arguments that social and technological change required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they made a reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to media coverage of the trial and said they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring cleavages together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is it a forerunner of true bipartite cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders did not produce any breakthroughs on the major issues that must be addressed during the session of the "dirty duck".
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the committee on the president's deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
It's barely enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections arouse partisan passions and then fade.
That's good."
On some issues, such as those on the agenda of the "dirty duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there was more optimism about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the lame duck, with the ratification of the New START Pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session would not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th congress met in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is going on between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the voters present in the tea which contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, extending the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, imposed the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to issue their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there are few reasons or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care, and then be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The person who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Undisclosed US documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes to the Kremlin some of the bribes and the protection money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memorandum, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there have since been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw away, it's nonsense."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information in an embassy report; and it is unheard of that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to say that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is mixing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he admitted that little progress had been made.
The Embassy's note provides reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank Indiam".
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because there is no one in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption in Russia as a whole would amount to more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent poll on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American embassy, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the statements that US diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, as you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality decrepit concrete walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School spoke of the man who built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the helm of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in north-western Cambodia where he had hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure built; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, taught Khmer Rouge history to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In view of this development, anxiety has increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowd Pol Pot's government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements came in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas at their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defection to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into black poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although a few Khmer Rouge elite officers kept their local leadership positions in exchange for laying down their arms, they are unskilled farmers of low rank and file.
"These people received very little follow-up after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Court has also caused concern here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, begin the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer red minister.
The court's mandate is to try the senior leaders and principals responsible for the crimes, but he did not say whether he was pursuing more than those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there's more prosecution, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects, although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he says.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first government-approved manual on Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, made up of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history manuals, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng's youth know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng's high school, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They don't trust each other because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside mobile phone dealer, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was released in a joint communiqué after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But American officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke of the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, held at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it has been beneficial to extend an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton described the agreement as "a very significant, important step" achieved by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries dispose of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're just going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus came closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The US government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization have been implemented to build confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government did not object to CIA flights.
The government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States Ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by Wikileaks' filtered (cable) documents to the daily El País, who added that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Government of Zapatero out-of-game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken out of hand," Aguirre says in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of External Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a capacity of limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manoeuvre the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a lunch between US Ambassador Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba and Internes Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid the comments of an inflamed rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has condoned or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she says.
The parricide that went to confession complained in network of the "avoidably" being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was little, communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of the Coruña from which she originated.
Messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, one must know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they split up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him run the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a nearby municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, one hears that their idyllus has fractured, they have separated.
In March of 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what means being with the child all day and not having the freedom to do what he wants."
And then, she's talking about a cell phone message she just received: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains: "If he doesn't like it, let the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she claims.
In May, she talks about the coming back to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a work station in order not to lose him".
She explains that if everything was all right, she would have taken her eldest with her.
"He will remain with the correct person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him with another person in my life if this person is not my mother", dubious intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When she pats him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he had supposedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"César's happy on one side, but he's not happy on the other."
"On one side he's with me and he likes this place a little, but on another he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"He'll go there (the child) a few hours away from the summer and so I save some money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos in the e-mail, you know, whenever he wants, he finds me, shit."
On 30th, another: "The child is well, and goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He gives me money".
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the liberator of the prison."
"Terror to the Galician (Epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, watchful, declared her regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so that she didn't tell her that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, coming from the judicial detention centre in Menorca.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor either".
Before she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting her body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric trial.
Members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomic elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these committees normally doubles that which it receives in the Catalans.
For example, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics they obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes from the SCP and the retention of the PP electorate, the analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the SCP could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and SCP would lose no more than 9 MPs (it has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - he has three now - while ICV would keep a MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal committees, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a 500-vote difference compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they ended up several times.
The popular have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Police Station in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, run from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, among which "Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the perpetrator of the Bombay bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has been "debilitated" Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus at international level and "consequently, its operating capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that were integrating the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" could cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network held operating in Europe, that is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to that recorded on the night of Tuesday spent in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained in Thailand another, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who headed the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - some of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists who met the conditions marked by the name "World Islamic Front".
That is to say, the documents had to be in the name of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, valid for several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia a few miles of dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the integrated members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC's leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions in support of his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which amount to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address to half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the CiU candidate requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the moment the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as far as the president of the PP is concerned, in order to support a nomination "one should eliminate all sovereignist and independentist discourses", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converges even wants to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bets to make the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the inauguration of Mas will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarat Catalana).
The geriatrics claim that the dead were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot centre do not eliminate the possibility of their night nurse killing more than 11 elderly people
Geriatric officials La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to lay the charge against the person responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civilian officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of geriatrics - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's counsel added that "in this case there is only a hint of recklessness on the part of any other person other than the accused".
The person already named "the Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her death by injecting her with a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with a mix of sedative pellets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the centre's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or instead he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight assassinations.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to yesterday's threat from Trichet, which warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials of the peripherals closed to force and the shares of the European banks suffered more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes either, and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and very speculative positions closures.
The institutional investor will delay losing fear.
A month ago, BCE quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and the quarterly unlimited-access auction will be maintained at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase programme and even give the signal to step up it.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they said they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
BCE must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought a lot, causing another collapse on the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflected a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment, sound to investors such as Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we have the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it resolves with strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available liquidity, triple it compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "except for being, to appear".
Courage, we can make it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "no one of law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, asked by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the larger holding company of business services for the companies does not appear to be willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the meeting of shareholders on January 18 this year whose challenge is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Madrid Commercial Magistrate No. 2, has again opened the box of thunders within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as "a desperate recourse of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argutia, by clearly fraud of the Law and abuse of the right, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the fact that once the meeting takes place, it will be contested by considering that it is "nil of its own right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless requests usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the motion for challenge for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, his story in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first moment, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill of the champion's rider, the German Sebastien Vette, no longer the ability of the Renault engine to propel his car, in the world of Formula 1 we are talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to transform him into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly chains from manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-qualification professionals are working, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyzing and projecting all kinds of modifications on the cars.
Siemens' manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's cars except the engine, which is Renault's sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As a unique limitation of this madness of technological development, there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this assignment has 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety zero.
The plant's technology manager, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that R+D progress in racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational is planning to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice-president, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned shop located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to implement 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in buying, assistance, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP's computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed especially for MPEs and users, because the big companies have already contracted technical support services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell waits three years to capture a million specific customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new management plan that will hold a three-year maturity.
The aim, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public subsidies from FROB, is to gain a market share by capturing a million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduce those who can leave the bank - its great task to do, because until now this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the particular customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while to companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as a goal, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its management plan Optima, established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more fiscal year.
Clients who let savings banks escape will be his main objective.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business," he stressed.
And even if he thinks that the war on liabilities - which penalises margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for its issues to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital requirements "increase enormously" and that some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
And he mentioned that the FROB can replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After having assured Sabadell that he can survive the market closure, he has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but on the contrary of what happened in June, we can obtain short-term financing through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the merger process of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they reserved themselves for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of them have been completely realized; it is possible that instead of 13 or 14, all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated extensively in this operation as well," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the time limits set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he imphatized.
"The transition from 45 caisses to an average of 28 500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a fairly happy series of opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and attributed to those who doubt it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "go at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had made good use of the stress tests that ECB had carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and the 30% of the Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not an error in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, this is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shockes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost a 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission boosted deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (tax discipline plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel made it difficult to prolong the decision to save Greece.
From then on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the EU reform process which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not be in agreement, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that breach the rules will be severely punished, they may be obliged to declare themselves at the end of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a party of costs.
Germany warns us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a matter of extending the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead us to a greater tranquillity.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard him in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of the new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the path to the thesis to be put order at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that we are considering, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a currency zone that is too crowded with unsound countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to Alonso's and Ramos's against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the desire to escape punishment.
In principle, the expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink on the anti-sportive character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team already won clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the dam match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards in the next phase.
Finally, UEFA's discipline committee sanctioned team coach José Mourinho with two games and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the related case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem displays nobility and honour and which on past occasions condemned to a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to his dilated story of histrionic technician and provocative.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibit by the regulation contradict the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions commit a fraud of law; for they are indeed actions that respect the sports regulation, but seem to avoid its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the team of infractors from benefiting unfairly from the opposite team, which is also not the case.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in hiding to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalization of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that infractors obtain from the intended errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club wouldn't be able to count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a sanction match and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the ladder, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which nevertheless forms part of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they chose instead the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without defeating the penalty or escaping that one.
Even though the border between genius and fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director was passed on to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offer to receive Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also come back the dinner groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive you adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete the complexity of accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvestre falls on Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of reservations of dinners for peak days (the 17th and the 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them with their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the slice around the 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of various institutions in the centre shows the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
The Soteras group says that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.9 to 30 euros," they explained.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate in advance the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the Fecasarm employer (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the possibility of beginning to see the final of the tunnel and maintains that overall the reservations are "animated", even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, the hope for the festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks' filtration confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by Pakistan's nuclear program.
Apart from the illuminating and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme — the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make it difficult for them to be destroyed in the event of an attack — is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistani production of nuclear weapons.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", argues: "Transparency is often absent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting Wikileaks Chief
Obama will count on a high-ranking anti-terrorist leader to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest filtering of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On the 20th the international police force based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
For example, the 188 Interpol countries were told to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the appeal red notice as a free route for arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be present.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder's willingness to respond via video conference to the Swedish authorities' questions.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of security of Stalin.
"It seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he granted from an undetermined location an interview to the editor of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she has been responsible for giving orders to the American graduates they are watching at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not at all sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself has instructed a senior anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to reduce Assange's importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators have today.
Peter King, the congressman who from January onwards will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate his funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further away went Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to go back on his statements after saying that Assange would have to "be murdered."
"Obama should turn him into an objective and use an unmanned plane or something similar."
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the government that filtered the information is guilty of treason and whatever is not an execution would be too kind punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it absolutely cannot give him headaches that he had with other currents extinguished.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with winks that allow him to blind himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they can do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than putting his position at the disposal of militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a majority enough to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive to a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the latter's promise to schedule the congress for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room with family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he points out.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures that come from the adept sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC once and for all liquid assembly as a working mechanism.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulsions of 2008 mandated the management to revise the model of assembly in a specific congress of reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical areas on the lookout, the time could be right to take it back and close it forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders are mentioned these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Between the cases mention is made of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, town of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The following day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the port-baggage of an abandoned vehicle in the street Mixtecas in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the Naucalpan municipality.
Very early in the morning on Thursday, the four, the owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the autopiste near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipe Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he was leaving his house to initiate garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a shot at the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead, a man's corpse was found on a lonely way to Colonia El Naranjo and under the body a gun shot of calibre 25 was found.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies performed an exhaustive search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, with their hands tied behind them and their eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound in his neck.
Half the month it was reported that two men had been executed, who had been wrapped in blankets and left in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán municipality of Zaragoza. At the same time, two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
A day later, a box of cardboard containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the town of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreed with a message that his executioners had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck one found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, we detected Santa Muerte's tattoos and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, a man's corpse was found on the edge of a car in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with their head in the middle and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipes of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancon settlement and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a breaketol with a message.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he explained, his country has inverted $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the last four years.
Nevertheless, he had made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with government and local governments to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reductions.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and private initiative.
There is also one provincial climate change project, another one for the change of incandescent lamps by efficient lamps and another one for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he explained, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase 20% energy efficiency in the last five years and plans to make another similar one around 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion from Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos has been legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is rightful.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's taking of protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, if necessary, a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there was never an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on the next 4 and 5 December, when a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that no doubt the council will be able to elegate the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the lead "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the revival recorded by the party in the previous elections of July 4 will be reflected on the next fight, even if "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made "a lot of hopes as far as they are concerned, and I am sure Gabino will live up to the expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the Priists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they are coming out of the cabinet," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama Promotes Law on Twitter for Undocumented Students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitty the U.S. president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted Obama.
His short message maintains an open cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to contact Senators immediately, as voting on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we're hoping for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the expansion of the Bush tax cuts and government funding continued.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the republican blockage of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said it is confidant that once the fiscal problem is resolved, one can fix a legend for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Leader of the Senate's Democratic Majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country for the last five years and they were accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the assistance of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the project protagonists an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courted Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past were Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put a finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the language was a walk in which participants displayed the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature and this time used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in the embarrassment", gently launched the Argentinean writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio which Shultz defined later as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "lay" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only leads in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiousologist she comes out convinced: "Pastiness is not my strong, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually opened, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the plague I have only been able to know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very interrelated.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a lovely narrative which he called "Eloge à l'invention", where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorcerer who touched clouds, turned people back who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a damsel had lost, a narration that turned out to speak America, the great news that had had her own columnists from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narratives of the conquering capitans.
"Cervans who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in an aiter way we would never have told America's history with an imagination that lacked even modesty."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "mads and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lie, it is no longer known what part of narration belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his legacy that we are what we are telling."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table Le must on the wound.
Puerto Rican Cuba has put its own on the great plague of the social violence that its country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting our finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very convenient by thinking in caricature, white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to reach three times the decisive series, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up comforting himself with the medal of sub-champion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The santist strategist came to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, because his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump with the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to get out of the mess so he can celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any stats, it's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot about the last final, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I think that's a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish to hold the title in our hands, hands it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we no longer arrive in this situation".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (CSA, as its acronyms in English) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for aspiring candidates, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for business and investor visas.
Those wishing to renew their visa will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only report to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be captured in the CSA, applicants who wish a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in the CSA for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA to announce the discovery of alien life
The space agency of the United States quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA assured that it would present an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in Arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), with the prospect that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, one denounces.
The 60th had just settled when in Congress an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which declared itself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality on the part of PRI and NAP.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of NAP and PRI to change the scheme from a political will and if they did not, they would again be enslaved by both parties and in this way the opposition coalition would end.
"Until here has arrived (the opposing coalition), this is what I am looking at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, that is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now Congress has turned into a 'goal' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they don't leave by cupular agreements out to 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now to the five whom we are seen, separated in different fractions, we decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, this is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán Town Hall pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town Hall.
With it, the amount that was paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipe, the last check number 9258447 was issued the past 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Supreme Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Gazette of the Crown, as predicted by the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Noroeste had published a revision of the cheques that the Town Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the foreign tourist accident because of the poor conditions at the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the Mazatlán tourist sector asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly asked that the image of the destination be treated and new activities must replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because the tourists come to walk there and they see the disorder and avoid the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the job for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Mangart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Town Hall.
"The municipe will have to assume its responsibility and avoid it going through again, how to do it, therefore through a preventive interview and only make the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must we maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it only depends on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the necessary attention and this type of fact underlines something that is known to all, maintenance is necessary".
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happily Mazatlán offers many historic and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that they can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination".
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
Mazatlán's business sector is seeking a dignified and free-of-agreement Labour Legislature between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, formed by seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN members, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
"We hope that MPs really exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and especially committed job with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Mangart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate job generation."
With regard to tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Governmental Tourism.
"I understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and which competes directly with agro-industry."
Apart from the need to classify resources to detonating tourist projects that help to give certainty to the state and to update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures could not solve.
We're looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebs' for sale on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very dear," recalls Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, shoes size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, shoes size 8.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of the size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, by giving a toy or money at the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Service de police de Sherbrooke and the Régie de police Memphrémagog took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated when the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand up with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for the detention of anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Bloc Québécois leader, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was attacking the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said Duceppe.
The NDP's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected criticisms that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that action should be taken against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led to elections in the event of its rejection.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each MP who opposed would then explain to his or her constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not dated from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York in January of this year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It didn't take any more for the pequistic public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a DIY solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we're going to announce it, he's just saying."
"We're aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest persists in not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and I that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is Jean Charest's resignation," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To break this impasse, he therefore suggested that Quebec give the Auditor General a special mandate to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate," he said.
He also felt that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently working on some of the amendments related to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which struck the biker groups, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high monitoring due to heavy rainfall in several areas of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road broke down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, i.e. 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations need to be added to the snow melt already accumulated in some areas, there is concern that several streams may be overflowing.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Sécurité civile du Québec for the Ouareau and the Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watch and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes resulted in the closure of several roads, including the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Safety remains alert and closely monitors the situation," said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued strong flood warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, L'Achigan, Batiscan and Le Loup.
Partly blamed Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial comments on social assistance and Haitians as well as his gross language on the air.
The CBSC considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the comments contained "incorrect information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language that is not suitable for programming broadcast during the day."
The Commission also found that a discussion on suicide, including the distribution of the names of two persons who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programming broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes aides sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes called into question of "Dupont at midday" have addressed a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
Therefore, no blame was held against him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then gave themselves to a face-to-face media that had aroused many reactions.
The host of CHOI said that he had made no donations to help Haitians because one could not know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on this."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the world's tatamis and ringings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and clerk for UPS has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Currently, I'm getting ready to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished among the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed at every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels take place initially on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most renowned puglist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the kung fu's Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the friendly fellow.
"It's a bit like the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It's been a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the finals.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).
"The winners of the semifinals are competing in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies which obtained the most important, that of the project's stewardship, for a sum of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium awarded the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and leading to higher prices.
"It's the new way of collusion and knocking down competition."
"That is to say that people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it open," said Péquiste Member of Parliament Sylvain Simard in a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau replied in the afternoon, strongly denying collusion for this contract.
"I'm beginning to have my trip," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "mishonest" and "lack of rigour."
She said "that would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is under way and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition playing field; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week in Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of Quebec's business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the James Bay territory is responding to specific labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to them since the 1970s."
The great owner of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JES), gave an explanation that caused the project's stewardship contract to be over-the-counter.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Énergie gerance is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with Energy Stewardship of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped the fact that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance it", before stating that they were rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - Green label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in the players in sustainable development, but also in fair brands and greening certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even though he is bathed in a media world where messages in favor of more responsible consumption spread, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even describes as a hindrance to his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatoire de la consommation responsable de l'Université Sherbrooke.
Another observation is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' discourse on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be essential to stimulate this portion of current consumption by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubiousness of information would calm the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are also wary of the alleged performance of green products or services that are being sought to put them in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to change their habit and, above all, to change the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
They also promoted purchases from local merchants and preferred to purchase food products grown in their area, according to the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 in this year - , the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers reported using public transit or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which just took its first shot.
A State loan to buy eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only up to one loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministère de la Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him his full cinemaphilic vocation, did not obtain what they were demanding.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be less than the original expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state agencies.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris file.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the notion of the gift of the State must really be ruled out.
Recall that the Association des propriétés de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec was opposed to a direct investment by the state to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministère de la Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of caeans, for ten years held the author's cinema at his premises of the complex after having financed its own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of theatres for independent films is stark in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push to the wheel of acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallele, has continued to broadcast films in eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by showing Xavier Beauvois' very beautiful film Des hommes et des gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. considers to be the Canadian inferiority complex towards the Americans, but at the same time betray their sense of superiority towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out on the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to get under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of a federal election campaign, recounts how far the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gave a few explanations for this situation.
"A complex of almost inherent Canadian inferiority may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues in everyday life rather than putting this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" as both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa business officer, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-$40 billion stimulus package," Breese wrote.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast on CBC are returning from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border programmes, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or to the abductions for aggressive CIA interrogations.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome certain prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that the spirits are warming up regarding the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "assassed".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (LED or LED) in English, most of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of emissions from the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase aggregate GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But this balance sheet will have to be subtracted from 5 Gt in order to stabilize by 2020 the climate increase to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all-new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to generating very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have shown reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs as they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact light bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion per year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesperson for the head of the UN."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission passed the Wednesday midnight deadline without publishing the results three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the Chairman of the CIS stated on television that the commission "continue to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo is counting on the Constitutional Council's cancellation of "fraudful" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters by FNs in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The whole election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denied any connection with the ex-rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had remained split in two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the lead of the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including the overseas departments), showing the provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed in metropolitan France is 2.631 million.
The second quarter data were confirmed at 9.3% of the labour force in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the overseas departments.
Over a year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed under ILO.
Seniors saw a slight rise in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points over three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the overseas departments.
Only 25-49-year-olds enjoyed unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so, however, and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the president PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and detained at the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abuse of social property, embezzlement of public funds and property, concealment, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to sue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's something else to prove," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS strongman in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, insisted, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged Wednesday night and jailed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than run the dumps he had to handle.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew about them, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts against him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being placed under judicial supervision, said the Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged with "subtraction and misappropriation of public property by a person entrusted with a public service mission", the other for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds".
Finally Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "recel of abuse of social property".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr.Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently collapsed in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have been used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous correspondence, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the survey, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept the public in suspense in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the close eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to deal with their own "hostages" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been matched by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they place in a raw light the way in which the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it wasn't.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with cases of hostages".
Elysée's strategic advisor, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly held nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "cruise constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocent", "immediate release".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
For, past the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss' prison release (which will take place on 16 August, the day she took refuge at the French Embassy) "will require a large sum of money to be paid to Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose US is demanding extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris, by decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran's clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear material, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian from the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the keeper of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot go back on the decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée advisor dials a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, by means of press releases and "runs" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influence" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles pass on the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the "media blitz" of French officials.
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons why the Elysée contributed to this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "save seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government is going to pass a "Cinderella" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people who are requested by parents, said the manager.
It will also provide people who demand it with free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In full turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, Fifa's executive committee designates Thursday the world cup organizing countries 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying may take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of Fifa competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its settlement in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of prominent members of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) measures the economic and political stakes of a World Championship.
The behind-the-scenes tractations may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to Fifa's evaluation report, the English, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Championship only once in 1966.
The BBC released a film on Monday, featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease the Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-release the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the organisation of the Olympic Games in London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's coat of arms to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spanish-Portugal duo does not lack advantages with its already ready stages, its expertise (Global-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of the two countries could give way to their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, becoming an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (stades, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We're covering them with mud, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, based on the experience of 1994, appeared to be the logical favourites.
As the world's leading economic power, the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately built a very good project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the event in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the World-2026 to China, ardently desired by the Fifa, which would in fact make the Asian chances obsolete by 2022.
With Qatar, which released the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new countries, but these two countries are more risky than certain.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from low TV fees paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the Fifa war.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
One warrant at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current Head of State will be running for office in 2012.
But the evidence is not good with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then you have to pretend that there is still doubt.
Either way.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
He spoke before UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening at the Elysée, so the prospect of "two terms" sows a bit of excitement.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The president simply recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of quinquennats to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he has spoken of the presidential elections, in the tone of humour, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the next step."
His remarks before yesterday did not make him more candidate than the previous day; they did not make him less.
If they get comments, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolène Royal's entry into the competition that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an earlier than expected order of battle.
The wrong polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no UMP discussion on this," immediately and cautiously reacted to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, clearly resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to provide an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations which are due to end at the end of the year.
Europe's sovereign debt crisis requires that the Frankfurt Issuing Institute will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory under the risk of aggravating a more tense situation on European bond markets today.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchasing programme.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners... "
The day before, in Brussels, at its hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more disapproval as to his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of state securities on the secondary market was continuing and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectation of further purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect a significant change in course.
While lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she's significantly changing her program."
"If not, it would risk creating new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", for his part Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds in order to drive a sluggish market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"At all costs, it needs to replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent an upsurge in returns paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly away, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is making a round back
After a worrisome start to the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday, with the decline in 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unreadable" and expected an "unforeseeable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had gone up to 263 points, causing a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the gap with German rates was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the agonizing tax revenues that go with it, putting the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the government deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new collective budget that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those requested from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period of time that was not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde once again hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that we have demonstrated it again Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defending their currency and monetary zone."
Although quite relative, yesterday's relaxation of the rates of European state bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk about a start to normalisation.
Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs heavily on banking systems," said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
All the more so since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are proceeding well.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began on Tuesday in Singapore an Asian tour to inform extreme-eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The front-line countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with a closer impact.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both are committed to avoiding the need for international assistance before setting up their own fiscal corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that are necessary to restore sustainable confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first put forward the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with, to date, EUR 60 billion.
An advice that is likely to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, were added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowy episodes are sufficient to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned from heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, billions have rained.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is mentioned for the Grand Paris metro station to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally come to the first additions.
The Financial Amendment Act 2010, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the bill, article 15, is "to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is costed: "The proceeds of this tax are 117 million euros per year".
The second is a redevelopment of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're a long way from the $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the €4 billion in capital that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project proceeds," the explanatory memorandum states.
At the GSP, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion after, we explain it."
"This will be included in the budget and drawn up as and when."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised are still to the absent subscribers, risks causing a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers avengers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only before the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only bring back what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sinisterly caricatural profile was long ago for the artists of cabaret matter to sketch.
The rule that secret records should be composed of only news already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in earlier books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (and does not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and who reconfirms what they have already learned.
It's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or with a limited mind) the head of the secret services (if not he could be, what do I know, editor at Libération), who holds only what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that which Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state could call themselves or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into espionage centers.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, public repetition violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put victims so much in crisis as the "bursts".
But come to the deep nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell's day, we could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had proved completely since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we show, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the avenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is within the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from him.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on-line any reserved information - it would amount to publishing it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is equally clear that, with current technologies, it is in vain to hope that confidential telephone relations can be maintained.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state flew around and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my forecast is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: deep down, the attempt to espionage the Watergate has had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now advancing in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephones).
The videocassettes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backwards and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With the high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the policy and communications techniques should go back to the horse cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France is hacking its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the implementation of the rapidly released financing promises (such as early start or early start financing) made by developed countries.
And the big French dowels are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (or EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU released the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, great side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency exercise was valuable and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen agreement, be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained, adding 150 million over three years to fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France believes that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, France's total support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses its method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ loan is equivalent to 1€ given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often emission mitigation projects that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At the most, it should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) fulfil their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union put €1 in order to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand, on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, it manages to make it believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy did the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any event, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward the discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not escape.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope lies in the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Warning of pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (ex-Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", purchased between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a ten-year-old child, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - and treats, were examined by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as some carcinogens as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, our survey shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as about twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Europe Ecology-Greens Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
